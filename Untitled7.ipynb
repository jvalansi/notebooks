    "I can play a game\n",
    "I can create a game here\n",
    "the game of life\n",
    "but a different game of life\n",
    "just if I did something I'm supposed to I get a point\n",

    "Hi\n",
    "Me again\n",
    "So what do we do?\n",

    "But now I think, maybe first we need AI\n",
    "So that it can help us advance faster in this field\n",
    "Ok\n",
    "So actually\n",
    "I should read the paper for neuralink\n",
    "See what the next steps are\n",
    "See if I can create a model to do that...\n",
    "I skimmed the paper\n",
    "What did I learn?\n",
    "They are building robots that insert threads to read signals from the brain\n",
    "Pretty straight forward\n",
    "They were able to read more than the current best approach I guess\n",
    "~3000 electrodes\n",
    "Not sure how many neurons per electrode\n",
    "Ok\n",
    "So what's the next step\n",
    "Right now it's tested on mice\n",
    "I guess the want to be able to use that for bmi (brain machine interface)\n",
    "Ok\n",
    "So well technically, with 3000 bits you can at least move a mouse (literally :)\n",
    "Ok\n",
    "So we can read\n",
    "Can we write?\n",

    "We need like 40 years\n",
    "That's fine\n",
    "But how can I help?\n",
    "Well they need electrical engineers\n",
    "Maybe design electiral circuits with machine learning\n",
    "Maybe\n",
    "Do they need any NLP thing?\n",
    "What about general tasks\n",
    "Like if ai can read and understand it should be able to do whatever an ee does\n",
    "So we just need general ai\n",
    "Ok\n",
    "So how do I bring that closer?\n",
    "Google is doing that\n",
    "Am I smart enough?\n",
    "I'll let them decide that\n",

    "How?\n",
    "Well we're trying to make Siri more like general ai\n",
    "For general AI we need multitasking\n",
    "Also I think we need oja rule\n",
