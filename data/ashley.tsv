730	August 17th	10:13:58 AM	mahoonie    	This platform
731	August 17th	10:14:32 AM	AshleyReyes1	everywhere there are privats and I have to leave this site to go to private on another ;)
732	August 17th	10:15:03 AM	mahoonie    	But most of the time you get privates there it seems
733	August 17th	10:15:41 AM	AshleyReyes1	in different ways at all
734	August 17th	10:16:07 AM	mahoonie    	Is Ashley your real name? I tried to find you with this name and couldn’t

971	August 18th	10:04:06 AM	AshleyReyes1	I thinkk so
972	August 18th	10:15:54 AM	mahoonie    	That what we have is special or that I'm wrong?

988	August 18th	10:27:07 AM	AshleyReyes1	so I didn't, why are you asking that?
989	August 18th	10:27:19 AM	mahoonie    	Would you do that for me?

997	August 18th	10:32:53 AM	AshleyReyes1	sorry

1008	August 18th	10:41:30 AM	mahoonie    	What do you want to discuss now?
1009	August 18th	10:43:02 AM	AshleyReyes1	do you have a day off?

1011	August 18th	10:44:05 AM	AshleyReyes1	it's great

1016	August 18th	10:45:43 AM	mahoonie    	Ok
1017	August 18th	10:45:50 AM	mahoonie    	So you have a lot of time off
1018	August 18th	10:46:13 AM	mahoonie    	What do you do with all that time off?
1019	August 18th	10:46:36 AM	AshleyReyes1	oh I just don't have free time
1020	August 18th	10:46:37 AM	AshleyReyes1	hehe
1021	August 18th	10:46:47 AM	mahoonie    	So you do nothing?
1022	August 18th	10:46:59 AM	mahoonie    	It's very hard to do nothing :)
1023	August 18th	10:47:28 AM	AshleyReyes1	as I said I work as a make-up artist, I am a volunteer, I start getting tattoos (for which I don't have enough time) and I need to go to the gym
1024	August 18th	10:47:46 AM	AshleyReyes1	"that's why I exclude this ""work"" from my life"
1025	August 18th	10:48:50 AM	mahoonie    	Right, but everything you said sounds like work
1026	August 18th	10:48:58 AM	mahoonie    	What do you do for fun?
1027	August 18th	10:49:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	I hardly have time for this, probably these sites are my entertainment and meeting with friends
1028	August 18th	10:49:52 AM	mahoonie    	I'm happy to hear that I'm your fun :)
1029	August 18th	10:50:15 AM	AshleyReyes1	I think you understood me correctly
1030	August 18th	10:50:20 AM	AshleyReyes1	and you?
1031	August 18th	10:50:21 AM	mahoonie    	Always happy to help
1032	August 18th	10:50:37 AM	mahoonie    	I like to think
1033	August 18th	10:50:45 AM	mahoonie    	And friends
1034	August 18th	10:50:55 AM	AshleyReyes1	think? about?
1035	August 18th	10:51:05 AM	mahoonie    	Random stuff
1036	August 18th	10:51:14 AM	mahoonie    	Like I like to understand stuff
1037	August 18th	10:51:15 AM	AshleyReyes1	good
1038	August 18th	10:51:33 AM	mahoonie    	I'm a nerd 8-)
1039	August 18th	10:51:44 AM	AshleyReyes1	me too
1040	August 18th	10:51:47 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
1041	August 18th	10:52:15 AM	AshleyReyes1	I was an excellent student at school
1042	August 18th	10:52:20 AM	mahoonie    	Really?
1043	August 18th	10:52:24 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
1044	August 18th	10:52:31 AM	mahoonie    	I mean you look smart
1045	August 18th	10:52:42 AM	mahoonie    	But you are way too beautiful to be a nerd
1046	August 18th	10:53:17 AM	AshleyReyes1	thanks but it's true
1047	August 18th	10:53:19 AM	mahoonie    	What's your favorite subject?
1048	August 18th	10:53:50 AM	AshleyReyes1	I like history and geography
1049	August 18th	10:53:55 AM	AshleyReyes1	and your?
1050	August 18th	10:54:10 AM	mahoonie    	Physics
1051	August 18th	10:54:20 AM	mahoonie    	I hated history in high school
1052	August 18th	10:54:20 AM	AshleyReyes1	omg...
1053	August 18th	10:54:25 AM	mahoonie    	But now I love it
1054	August 18th	10:54:37 AM	AshleyReyes1	I have the same with physics
1055	August 18th	10:54:47 AM	AshleyReyes1	when is YouTube
1056	August 18th	10:54:56 AM	AshleyReyes1	interesting stories hahah
1057	August 18th	10:55:24 AM	AshleyReyes1	if i get up you will see my panties
1058	August 18th	10:55:30 AM	AshleyReyes1	oooh

1060	August 18th	10:55:54 AM	AshleyReyes1	I was thinking, sorry
1061	August 18th	10:55:56 AM	AshleyReyes1	ot to you
1062	August 18th	10:56:02 AM	AshleyReyes1	not*
1063	August 18th	10:56:08 AM	AshleyReyes1	NOT TO YOU hahahah
1064	August 18th	10:57:18 AM	mahoonie    	You just can't stop talking to me :)
1065	August 18th	10:57:25 AM	mahoonie    	Poor girl :)
1066	August 18th	10:58:09 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes hahah
1067	August 18th	10:58:23 AM	mahoonie    	YouTube is amazing
1068	August 18th	10:58:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
1069	August 18th	10:58:33 AM	mahoonie    	I have this idea
1070	August 18th	10:58:50 AM	mahoonie    	You know how all the information is on Wikipedia?
1071	August 18th	10:59:01 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
1072	August 18th	10:59:18 AM	mahoonie    	But it's more fun to watch youtube
1073	August 18th	10:59:22 AM	mahoonie    	Right?
1074	August 18th	10:59:30 AM	AshleyReyes1	yess
1075	August 18th	10:59:49 AM	mahoonie    	What if you could turn a Wikipedia page to a YouTube video with a click
1076	August 18th	11:00:35 AM	AshleyReyes1	aaand?
1077	August 18th	11:00:46 AM	mahoonie    	That's it
1078	August 18th	11:00:56 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahhahaha
1079	August 18th	11:01:05 AM	mahoonie    	Instead of reading a boring Wikipedia page you get to see a cool video
1080	August 18th	11:01:22 AM	AshleyReyes1	this is an interesting idea, but the principle is the same on YouTube
1081	August 18th	11:01:49 AM	mahoonie    	I trust the information on Wikipedia more
1082	August 18th	11:01:49 AM	AshleyReyes1	just click on YouTube instead of Wikipedia :D
1083	August 18th	11:02:52 AM	mahoonie    	Don't you ever have to read a Wikipedia page?
1084	August 18th	11:02:59 AM	mahoonie    	Or any other article?
1085	August 18th	11:03:10 AM	mahoonie    	You always look at YouTube ?
1086	August 18th	11:03:11 AM	AshleyReyes1	you can't believe Wikipedia, I think it can be edited by ordinary people
1087	August 18th	11:03:34 AM	AshleyReyes1	of course I use Wikipedia
1088	August 18th	11:03:46 AM	mahoonie    	So you need my idea :)
1089	August 18th	11:04:04 AM	mahoonie    	Wikipedia has less errors than any other encyclopedia
1090	August 18th	11:04:24 AM	mahoonie    	Most people add information not corrupt it
1091	August 18th	11:04:49 AM	AshleyReyes1	I still don't agree with you B)
1092	August 18th	11:05:16 AM	mahoonie    	Why?
1093	August 18th	11:08:36 AM	AshleyReyes1	I've already said that people have access to this and that it's best to check information from multiple sources, not just blindly trust Wikipedia
1094	August 18th	11:09:35 AM	mahoonie    	I agree, don't blindly trust anything
1095	August 18th	11:09:56 AM	mahoonie    	You are a nerd :)
1096	August 18th	11:10:33 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah and you
1097	August 18th	11:11:14 AM	mahoonie    	But the general idea is that every time you need to read something boring, you instead transform it to a cool video
1098	August 18th	11:11:30 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
1099	August 18th	11:11:45 AM	AshleyReyes1	when you just go to YouTube ;) hahah
1100	August 18th	11:12:23 AM	mahoonie    	Not everything is on YouTube
1101	August 18th	11:14:25 AM	AshleyReyes1	if you're talking about hot Wikipedia articles hahaha
1102	August 18th	11:14:58 AM	mahoonie    	it could be anything
1103	August 18th	11:15:10 AM	mahoonie    	Wikipedia, news article, science paper
1104	August 18th	11:15:14 AM	mahoonie    	Even a book
1105	August 18th	11:15:54 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
1106	August 18th	11:17:45 AM	mahoonie    	Yes! so you like it?
1107	August 18th	11:18:43 AM	AshleyReyes1	I believe that the 21st century, or rather 2020, is easier and more interesting to watch educational videos than to read on the site, even in Wikipedia ;)
1108	August 18th	11:18:57 AM	mahoonie    	Good
1109	August 18th	11:19:18 AM	mahoonie    	You'll be one of the first users once I'm done building it
1110	August 18th	11:19:35 AM	AshleyReyes1	are you a programmer? hehehe
1111	August 18th	11:19:41 AM	mahoonie    	Yes
1112	August 18th	11:19:49 AM	AshleyReyes1	woow
1113	August 18th	11:19:58 AM	mahoonie    	8-)
1114	August 18th	11:20:09 AM	AshleyReyes1	what language do you code in?
1115	August 18th	11:20:18 AM	mahoonie    	My main one is python
1116	August 18th	11:20:25 AM	mahoonie    	Which ones do you know?
1117	August 18th	11:20:56 AM	AshleyReyes1	I thought it was a Python
1118	August 18th	11:20:57 AM	AshleyReyes1	B)
1119	August 18th	11:21:20 AM	AshleyReyes1	Java, Pascal hahah
1120	August 18th	11:21:25 AM	AshleyReyes1	php
1121	August 18th	11:21:27 AM	AshleyReyes1	hehehe
1122	August 18th	11:21:30 AM	mahoonie    	Pascal?
1123	August 18th	11:21:34 AM	mahoonie    	That's so old
1124	August 18th	11:21:38 AM	AshleyReyes1	knew a lot
1125	August 18th	11:21:39 AM	mahoonie    	Are you sure you

1128	August 18th	11:21:47 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
1129	August 18th	11:22:12 AM	AshleyReyes1	you can know everything, even what happened a few centuries ago, it does not mean that I should have lived at that time
1130	August 18th	11:22:29 AM	mahoonie    	But no one programs in pascal any more
1131	August 18th	11:22:46 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
1132	August 18th	11:22:49 AM	AshleyReyes1	know it
1133	August 18th	11:23:01 AM	AshleyReyes1	you asked how many languages I know, I answered
1134	August 18th	11:23:53 AM	mahoonie    	If you come here to Silicon Valley you cam make tons of money if you know how to program
1135	August 18th	11:23:57 AM	mahoonie    	Just saying
1136	August 18th	11:24:12 AM	AshleyReyes1	I know...
1137	August 18th	11:24:46 AM	mahoonie    	What's stopping you?
1138	August 18th	11:26:42 AM	AshleyReyes1	I don't know how to code hahah
1139	August 18th	11:27:04 AM	AshleyReyes1	my best friend's fiance is a programmer and he wants to take her to the States
1140	August 18th	11:27:06 AM	mahoonie    	Oh you just know the names of the languages :D

1143	August 18th	11:27:54 AM	mahoonie    	I was so impressed that you know Pascal
1144	August 18th	11:28:59 AM	mahoonie    	You can just get a 4 month course and be a programmer
1145	August 18th	11:29:42 AM	mahoonie    	You should join your best friend
1146	August 18th	11:33:48 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahaha yes
1147	August 18th	11:34:08 AM	AshleyReyes1	I think about it, but the country is big, not the fact that we will be close ;)
1148	August 18th	11:34:43 AM	mahoonie    	Most of the programming jobs are here
1149	August 18th	11:36:34 AM	AshleyReyes1	I know

1155	August 18th	11:43:13 AM	AshleyReyes1	it would be an amazing picture hehehe
1156	August 18th	11:44:01 AM	mahoonie    	;*

1231	August 20th	8:26:37 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
1232	August 20th	8:26:54 AM	mahoonie    	So just a different room?
1233	August 20th	8:27:02 AM	mahoonie    	That's your bedroom?
1234	August 20th	8:27:03 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
1235	August 20th	8:27:09 AM	AshleyReyes1	no
1236	August 20th	8:27:18 AM	AshleyReyes1	not really

1246	August 20th	8:29:57 AM	AshleyReyes1	by the way, sorry about that, I was trying to fix
1247	August 20th	8:30:08 AM	mahoonie    	You're still super beautiful
1248	August 20th	8:30:55 AM	AshleyReyes1	oh thank you
1249	August 20th	8:31:08 AM	AshleyReyes1	just a little slow? hehe
1250	August 20th	8:31:31 AM	mahoonie    	You know where the internet is great?
1251	August 20th	8:32:25 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
1252	August 20th	8:32:33 AM	AshleyReyes1	in SF?
1253	August 20th	8:32:37 AM	mahoonie    	Yes!
1254	August 20th	8:33:00 AM	mahoonie    	I can watch like 100 girls at the same time
1255	August 20th	8:33:15 AM	AshleyReyes1	what?
1256	August 20th	8:33:38 AM	mahoonie    	I have enough internet to watch 100 girls at the same time
1257	August 20th	8:33:48 AM	AshleyReyes1	wow
1258	August 20th	8:34:16 AM	AshleyReyes1	but my problem is not on the Internet, but on the computer itself
1259	August 20th	8:34:22 AM	mahoonie    	I'm only watching you though
1260	August 20th	8:34:54 AM	mahoonie    	You know where the computers are great?
1261	August 20th	8:35:03 AM	AshleyReyes1	I don’t mind you watching not only me ;)
1262	August 20th	8:35:13 AM	AshleyReyes1	HAHAHHA
1263	August 20th	8:35:20 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes... I know...
1264	August 20th	8:36:26 AM	mahoonie    	You don't? Not even a little bit?
1265	August 20th	8:44:34 AM	AshleyReyes1	what?
1266	August 20th	9:12:48 AM	mahoonie    	You don't care I watch other girl even a little?
1267	August 20th	9:13:27 AM	AshleyReyes1	but I can't forbid you something
1268	August 20th	9:15:05 AM	mahoonie    	Of course, but you can care :)
1269	August 20th	9:16:07 AM	AshleyReyes1	I think it's wrong, you have the right to look at whoever you want, because I do the same ;)
1270	August 20th	9:17:37 AM	mahoonie    	You look at other girls?
1271	August 20th	9:18:32 AM	AshleyReyes1	boys
1272	August 20th	9:20:13 AM	mahoonie    	So how was your date?
1273	August 20th	9:21:00 AM	AshleyReyes1	it was a friendly meeting, but it was fun, thanks
1274	August 20th	9:21:14 AM	mahoonie    	Are you guys together now?
1275	August 20th	9:21:31 AM	AshleyReyes1	what?
1276	August 20th	9:21:47 AM	mahoonie    	Like are you a couple?
1277	August 20th	9:22:00 AM	AshleyReyes1	noo
1278	August 20th	9:22:20 AM	AshleyReyes1	I told you that we are just friends and why are you so interested in this?
1279	August 20th	9:22:48 AM	mahoonie    	Just a little bit jealous :)
1280	August 20th	9:23:25 AM	mahoonie    	I'm not as cool as you
1281	August 20th	9:24:10 AM	AshleyReyes1	why?
1282	August 20th	9:24:25 AM	AshleyReyes1	why am I cool?
1283	August 20th	9:24:51 AM	mahoonie    	Like, you don't care, never jealous
1284	August 20th	9:25:15 AM	AshleyReyes1	I do not get the point of it
1285	August 20th	9:25:29 AM	mahoonie    	Of being jealous?
1286	August 20th	9:25:47 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
1287	August 20th	9:26:32 AM	mahoonie    	There is no point, it's not rational, it's a feeling
1288	August 20th	9:26:58 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes, I know
1289	August 20th	9:28:13 AM	AshleyReyes1	it just makes less sense to be jealous
1290	August 20th	9:28:39 AM	mahoonie    	So when you have a boyfriend you're not jealous?
1291	August 20th	9:31:43 AM	AshleyReyes1	I am very jealous, but on this site it is pointless
1292	August 20th	9:31:54 AM	mahoonie    	Oh, ok
1293	August 20th	9:34:10 AM	AshleyReyes1	are you very jealous too?
1294	August 20th	9:34:19 AM	mahoonie    	Not usually
1295	August 20th	9:34:27 AM	AshleyReyes1	"when? "")"
1296	August 20th	9:37:35 AM	mahoonie    	There's this beautiful girl on this website, that is going on dates, and makes me jealous :)
1297	August 20th	9:39:38 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah ooh
1298	August 20th	9:40:12 AM	AshleyReyes1	you're so sweet
1299	August 20th	9:40:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	but
1300	August 20th	9:40:47 AM	AshleyReyes1	IT WAS NOT A DATE
1301	August 20th	9:40:48 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
1302	August 20th	9:41:00 AM	mahoonie    	So what did you guys do?
1303	August 20th	9:42:38 AM	AshleyReyes1	we took a walk, talked and then watched a movie, then there were 8 more people and we had a great time
1304	August 20th	9:42:52 AM	mahoonie    	Cool!
1305	August 20th	9:43:05 AM	mahoonie    	What's your dream date?
1306	August 20th	9:43:30 AM	AshleyReyes1	I don't even know...
1307	August 20th	9:44:01 AM	AshleyReyes1	I love romance
1308	August 20th	9:44:12 AM	AshleyReyes1	lots of romance
1309	August 20th	9:44:13 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
1310	August 20th	9:44:16 AM	AshleyReyes1	d you?
1311	August 20th	9:44:34 AM	mahoonie    	My dream date?
1312	August 20th	9:44:58 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
1313	August 20th	9:46:36 AM	mahoonie    	Really really good sex :)
1314	August 20th	9:48:34 AM	AshleyReyes1	is it all a date dream?
1315	August 20th	9:50:27 AM	mahoonie    	That's the important part
1316	August 20th	9:50:41 AM	mahoonie    	Sex is the most romantic thing imo
1317	August 20th	9:51:49 AM	AshleyReyes1	I agree, but I think it's a nice bonus on a date, not the most important thing
1318	August 20th	9:52:58 AM	mahoonie    	What is the most important part?
1319	August 20th	9:59:14 AM	AshleyReyes1	feelings, romance, views, a thrill in the heart, tenderness and if there are enough trusting feelings - already sex, and not just an animal instinct
1320	August 20th	10:01:31 AM	mahoonie    	Yes, but the peak is the sex
1321	August 20th	10:02:12 AM	mahoonie    	And we are animals :)
1322	August 20th	10:13:10 AM	AshleyReyes1	means your place in the cage ;)
1323	August 20th	10:14:12 AM	mahoonie    	Animals should be free
1324	August 20th	10:14:30 AM	mahoonie    	But I like the cage idea, kinky :)
1325	August 20th	10:15:19 AM	AshleyReyes1	at the expense of animals you said it right, oh my god, what are you thinking :)
1326	August 20th	10:16:11 AM	mahoonie    	Dream date: me and you in a cage, animal sex
1327	August 20th	10:43:56 AM	AshleyReyes1	everything is clear with you :)
1328	August 20th	10:44:24 AM	mahoonie    	What do you mean?
1329	August 20th	10:45:22 AM	AshleyReyes1	nothing, I just understood you
1330	August 20th	10:46:22 AM	mahoonie    	Sounds like a good date, no?
1331	August 20th	10:46:55 AM	AshleyReyes1	I described my perfect date, your idea doesn't seem like that to me
1332	August 20th	10:47:09 AM	AshleyReyes1	we have different priorities in this regard :)
1333	August 20th	10:47:48 AM	mahoonie    	We can have dinner, talk, walk over the bridge, and then go to a cage and have animal sex :)
1334	August 20th	10:48:33 AM	AshleyReyes1	still not that, let's admit that this is where our views differ
1335	August 20th	10:48:47 AM	AshleyReyes1	no matter how hot you are ;)
1336	August 20th	10:50:18 AM	mahoonie    	That's because you didn't try :)
1337	August 20th	10:50:39 AM	AshleyReyes1	you think so? ;)
1338	August 20th	10:51:01 AM	AshleyReyes1	well, about the bridge in San Francisco - I definitely haven't tried it :)
1339	August 20th	10:51:33 AM	mahoonie    	Did you try animal sex in a cage?
1340	August 20th	10:52:18 AM	AshleyReyes1	no, but animal sex yes
1341	August 20th	10:52:47 AM	AshleyReyes1	I don’t like thinking about the cage, I’m also not interested in it
1342	August 20th	10:52:51 AM	AshleyReyes1	soorry
1343	August 20th	10:53:38 AM	mahoonie    	Haha, yeah maybe the cage is not very comfortable
1344	August 20th	10:54:12 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
1345	August 20th	10:54:48 AM	mahoonie    	Where would you want to have sex?
1346	August 20th	10:55:54 AM	AshleyReyes1	I don't know either
1347	August 20th	10:55:57 AM	AshleyReyes1	and you?
1348	August 20th	10:56:41 AM	mahoonie    	I tried many places, but there's no place like home
1349	August 20th	10:56:58 AM	mahoonie    	Bed at home
1350	August 20th	10:57:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	maybe
1351	August 20th	11:00:32 AM	mahoonie    	Where's the best place you had sex?
1352	August 20th	11:01:34 AM	AshleyReyes1	I liked it almost always and everywhere
1353	August 20th	11:01:54 AM	mahoonie    	Except for cages
1354	August 20th	11:02:14 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
1355	August 20th	11:02:16 AM	mahoonie    	Horny girl
1356	August 20th	11:02:53 AM	AshleyReyes1	I remember the most inconvenient place, it was a construction site
1357	August 20th	11:03:11 AM	AshleyReyes1	a building that was not completed
1358	August 20th	11:03:20 AM	mahoonie    	Oh wow
1359	August 20th	11:03:30 AM	mahoonie    	I never did in a construction site
1360	August 20th	11:03:48 AM	mahoonie    	Where was the best place?
1361	August 20th	11:05:16 AM	AshleyReyes1	I think that the feelings and how I can be good, it is at home, in bed, and if the impressions... on the lake
1362	August 20th	11:05:48 AM	mahoonie    	Yes, lake, or beach
1363	August 20th	11:06:04 AM	mahoonie    	But sand...
1364	August 20th	11:06:22 AM	AshleyReyes1	on the beach is a bad idea
1365	August 20th	11:06:24 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
1366	August 20th	11:08:08 AM	mahoonie    	Did you have a lot of sex? With many guys?
1367	August 20th	11:09:02 AM	AshleyReyes1	first of all, I never liked this question, and second, I don't know what scale to count on
1368	August 20th	11:09:59 AM	mahoonie    	Like how many people have you been with?
1369	August 20th	11:10:39 AM	AshleyReyes1	I won't tell you
1370	August 20th	11:10:46 AM	mahoonie    	Why not
1371	August 20th	11:10:53 AM	mahoonie    	I can tell you my number
1372	August 20th	11:11:52 AM	AshleyReyes1	I don't tell it to anyone and I don't like to know it from others
1373	August 20th	11:12:07 AM	AshleyReyes1	unnecessary information :)
1374	August 20th	11:13:28 AM	mahoonie    	So a lot :)
1375	August 20th	11:14:42 AM	AshleyReyes1	what?
1376	August 20th	11:15:55 AM	mahoonie    	Many guys :) I don't judge, I just want to know you
1377	August 20th	11:16:35 AM	AshleyReyes1	what a strange assumption you have, it's not the best thing to recognize in a person
1378	August 20th	11:17:05 AM	mahoonie    	Usually when a girl doesn't want to tell, it is because it's a lot
1379	August 20th	11:17:27 AM	AshleyReyes1	this is prejudice
1380	August 20th	11:17:42 AM	AshleyReyes1	generalizing stereotypes
1381	August 20th	11:17:54 AM	mahoonie    	Yes, that's how the brain works
1382	August 20th	11:18:18 AM	AshleyReyes1	okay :)
1383	August 20th	11:22:43 AM	mahoonie    	On cb it says you give this number for 33 tk
1384	August 20th	11:24:23 AM	AshleyReyes1	I knew what you were going to say about it hahah
1385	August 20th	11:24:49 AM	AshleyReyes1	I don't write all the information about myself on the sites, I don't even know what the answer is
1386	August 20th	11:25:18 AM	mahoonie    	Oh wow
1387	August 20th	11:26:08 AM	AshleyReyes1	I told you a little secret
1388	August 20th	11:29:17 AM	mahoonie    	Do you easily fall in love?
1389	August 20th	11:30:38 AM	AshleyReyes1	I think yes
1390	August 20th	11:30:41 AM	AshleyReyes1	nd you?
1391	August 20th	11:30:46 AM	AshleyReyes1	and*

1646	September 1st	11:43:52 PM	mahoonie    	No, imagine, a puzzle piece, if it didn't have a bump or a hole, it wouldn't connect to any other piece

1851	September 3rd	11:17 PM	AshleyReyes1	hahhahaha
1852	September 3rd	11:17 PM	mahoonie    	I took the photo behind you, and did a image search, and found they are sold in Russia
1853	September 3rd	11:18 PM	mahoonie    	So now I know you're Russian
1854	September 3rd	11:18 PM	AshleyReyes1	not quite Russian, I spoke where I am from
1855	September 3rd	11:18 PM	mahoonie    	You did?
1856	September 3rd	11:18 PM	AshleyReyes1	although I do not mind visiting Russia, my ancestors were there
1857	September 3rd	11:20 PM	mahoonie    	Was I close?
1858	September 3rd	11:20 PM	AshleyReyes1	I'm not sure
1859	September 3rd	11:20 PM	AshleyReyes1	close that my ancestors were Russian
1860	September 3rd	11:21 PM	AshleyReyes1	and I'm wondering if these are provacations or if I really have Russian features
1861	September 3rd	11:21 PM	mahoonie    	No, I mean do you live close to Russia?
1862	September 3rd	11:22 PM	AshleyReyes1	I'm here
1863	September 3rd	11:22 PM	mahoonie    	And I say it as a compliment
1864	September 3rd	11:22 PM	mahoonie    	Russian women are beautiful
1865	September 3rd	11:28 PM	mahoonie    	And my ancestors are also from Russia (half of them I'm a mix)
1866	September 3rd	11:28 PM	AshleyReyes1	but I'm not Russian, why are only Russian women beautiful
1867	September 3rd	11:28 PM	mahoonie    	No
1868	September 3rd	11:29 PM	AshleyReyes1	this stereotype
1869	September 3rd	11:29 PM	AshleyReyes1	although you are too handsome for a man, is it also because of Russian genes?
1870	September 3rd	11:30 PM	mahoonie    	Maybe because of the mix
1871	September 3rd	11:31 PM	mahoonie    	So where are you from then?
1872	September 3rd	11:31 PM	AshleyReyes1	can I tell you this later?
1873	September 3rd	11:31 PM	mahoonie    	When?
1874	September 3rd	11:31 PM	AshleyReyes1	laater B)
1875	September 3rd	11:32 PM	mahoonie    	If I ever come to Moscow will you come say hi?
1876	September 3rd	11:32 PM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
1877	September 3rd	11:32 PM	AshleyReyes1	provocations

1892	September 3rd	11:37 PM	mahoonie    	Except for when you need to tell me that you are ready
1893	September 3rd	11:38 PM	mahoonie    	:D

1912	September 3rd	11:42 PM	AshleyReyes1	You don't want to hear lies now, do you?
1913	September 3rd	11:42 PM	mahoonie    	Nope

2245	September 10th	8:34 AM	AshleyReyes1	but you don’t need to know, in fact, everything is fine
2246	September 10th	8:35 AM	AshleyReyes1	if only because I met you

2254	September 10th	8:47 AM	mahoonie    	As I Said, I’m fine with you leaving as long as you leave me some way to keep in touch
2255	September 10th	8:48 AM	mahoonie    	Otherwise I’ll be very sad
2256	September 10th	8:48 AM	AshleyReyes1	I'll think about it, I'm glad that you would like to continue communication
2257	September 10th	8:49 AM	mahoonie    	Don’t you?
2258	September 10th	8:49 AM	AshleyReyes1	me too
2259	September 10th	8:50 AM	mahoonie    	So why are you not sure?
2260	September 10th	8:50 AM	AshleyReyes1	what am I not sure about?
2261	September 10th	8:51 AM	mahoonie    	You said you’ll think about it
2262	September 10th	8:51 AM	AshleyReyes1	because it's weird, I don't know how to explain it
2263	September 10th	8:51 AM	AshleyReyes1	probably I will have a great desire to leave all this and everything related to these sites here
2264	September 10th	9:06 AM	AshleyReyes1	I'm sorry if that sounds rude
2265	September 10th	9:07 AM	mahoonie    	Really? I’m sorry to hear that
2266	September 10th	9:08 AM	AshleyReyes1	sad but true
2267	September 10th	9:08 AM	mahoonie    	That hurts a little
2268	September 10th	9:08 AM	AshleyReyes1	sorry, I didn't think it was really that important
2269	September 10th	9:09 AM	AshleyReyes1	the ratio of models and members is the same here
2270	September 10th	9:09 AM	AshleyReyes1	I don't think the world will end on me
2271	September 10th	9:09 AM	AshleyReyes1	;)
2272	September 10th	9:10 AM	AshleyReyes1	anyway, I said I'd think about it
2273	September 10th	9:13 AM	mahoonie    	I just thought we have something special, special woman
2274	September 10th	9:17 AM	AshleyReyes1	Yes, it is
2275	September 10th	9:18 AM	mahoonie    	Is this place really that bad?
2276	September 10th	9:19 AM	mahoonie    	You can tell me, I’m here for you
2277	September 10th	9:19 AM	mahoonie    	I can be your psychologist, and you can be mine
2278	September 10th	9:26 AM	mahoonie    	Good practice
2279	September 10th	9:27 AM	AshleyReyes1	I really don't think this place is good for me
2280	September 10th	9:28 AM	AshleyReyes1	I like being with you, but there's no reason to run away from you
2281	September 10th	9:29 AM	mahoonie    	What do you mean?
2282	September 10th	9:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	I didn't mean that I want to run away from here forever and forget all these people, I just want this period of my life to be classified hahah
2283	September 10th	9:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	it's not about people, that's what I meant
2284	September 10th	9:30 AM	mahoonie    	Oh
2285	September 10th	9:30 AM	mahoonie    	Got it
2286	September 10th	9:31 AM	mahoonie    	It’s no shame in my opinion
2287	September 10th	9:31 AM	mahoonie    	For some reason sex is not accepted in our society. But sex is the most beautiful thing ever
2288	September 10th	9:31 AM	AshleyReyes1	this is for you, everyone has their own vision of it
2289	September 10th	9:32 AM	AshleyReyes1	I don't want to discuss it :)
2290	September 10th	9:32 AM	AshleyReyes1	I do not agree with you, but I know that fuck owns the world and because of fuck all the troubles in life and in the world hahahah
2291	September 10th	9:33 AM	AshleyReyes1	I'm not frigid hahah
2292	September 10th	9:33 AM	AshleyReyes1	I guess I get tired of so many dicks and Tits in my life, it's worth considering
2293	September 10th	9:34 AM	mahoonie    	All the trouble and all the fun :)
2294	September 10th	9:35 AM	mahoonie    	I don’t have to show you my dick if you don’t want
2295	September 10th	9:35 AM	AshleyReyes1	I knew I couldn't discuss this with you, you take it personally
2296	September 10th	9:35 AM	AshleyReyes1	although you say that we shouldn't fuck every day
2297	September 10th	9:36 AM	AshleyReyes1	I'm loving it
2298	September 10th	9:36 AM	mahoonie    	Loving what?
2299	September 10th	9:37 AM	mahoonie    	You can discuss everything with me, I’m a big boy
2300	September 10th	9:37 AM	AshleyReyes1	you're a big boy, but we have different views o :)n different things, age has nothing to do with it
2301	September 10th	9:38 AM	AshleyReyes1	face in the middle of a sentence hahah
2302	September 10th	9:39 AM	mahoonie    	But it’s good to have different views I think, no?
2303	September 10th	9:39 AM	mahoonie    	And you didn’t say what you’re loving
2304	September 10th	9:39 AM	AshleyReyes1	by the way, thank you for calming me down when you say that there is nothing shameful in this, I regard it as soothing words for me
2305	September 10th	9:41 AM	AshleyReyes1	I love that you say we shouldn't fuck every day
2306	September 10th	9:41 AM	mahoonie    	How many days do you want between fucks? I’m flexible ;)

2382	September 10th	11:47 AM	AshleyReyes1	do you think a coder is better than a php programmer? hahahah

2469	September 10th	12:49 PM	AshleyReyes1	I don't do it, they just take me in private without warning, as you can see now there was nothing
2470	September 10th	12:49 PM	AshleyReyes1	:*

2509	September 10th	10:48:46 PM	AshleyReyes1	okay hahah
2510	September 10th	10:49:10 PM	AshleyReyes1	it's when your body can't rest because of your brain
2511	September 10th	10:49:32 PM	mahoonie    	That happens usually when I'm stressed out
2512	September 10th	10:49:52 PM	mahoonie    	So do you have enough power to wrestle me today?
2513	September 10th	10:50:20 PM	AshleyReyes1	I don't even know, I don't really want to do anything, just watch

2550	September 10th	11:03:06 PM	mahoonie    	It's in English
2551	September 10th	11:03:21 PM	mahoonie    	I think all the English I know is from movies and music
2552	September 10th	11:03:48 PM	AshleyReyes1	Yes, I listen to a lot of music in English, because mostly good music has an English-language context
2553	September 10th	11:04:08 PM	AshleyReyes1	not the context but the content
2554	September 10th	11:04:32 PM	AshleyReyes1	so what language do you speak? your native language

2565	September 10th	11:06:18 PM	AshleyReyes1	okay B)
2566	September 10th	11:06:37 PM	mahoonie    	I studied computer science, and I really love machine learning, like teaching machines how to learn
2567	September 10th	11:06:51 PM	mahoonie    	Especially how to learn how to speak
2568	September 10th	11:07:10 PM	mahoonie    	And that's how I got the job at Apple on Siri
2569	September 10th	11:07:30 PM	AshleyReyes1	wow
2570	September 10th	11:08:00 PM	AshleyReyes1	so you write programs for iPhones or add-ons to Siri? or what?
2571	September 10th	11:08:35 PM	mahoonie    	I build the services that help Siri understand word in different languages
2572	September 10th	11:08:55 PM	AshleyReyes1	oh...
2573	September 10th	11:09:07 PM	AshleyReyes1	I've never used Siri
2574	September 10th	11:09:31 PM	AshleyReyes1	it pisses me off when she starts talking all of a sudden
2575	September 10th	11:09:31 PM	mahoonie    	Like for example in Russian you have so many inflections, like Different ways To change the same word
2576	September 10th	11:09:42 PM	mahoonie    	So you can't have all in the dictionary
2577	September 10th	11:10:01 PM	mahoonie    	You need to build some model that knows how to change the words
2578	September 10th	11:10:13 PM	mahoonie    	You don't like Siri?
2579	September 10th	11:10:50 PM	mahoonie    	Are you jealous that she gets my attention ;P
2580	September 10th	11:11:17 PM	AshleyReyes1	I like that you call me Russian
2581	September 10th	11:11:28 PM	AshleyReyes1	still so by chance
2582	September 10th	11:11:30 PM	AshleyReyes1	hahahahahah
2583	September 10th	11:11:40 PM	AshleyReyes1	maniac
2584	September 10th	11:11:54 PM	AshleyReyes1	yes, I think this is a function for old people
2585	September 10th	11:12:31 PM	mahoonie    	I'm like almost half Russian
2586	September 10th	11:12:43 PM	mahoonie    	Like almost half my ancestors came from there
2587	September 10th	11:12:58 PM	AshleyReyes1	cool
2588	September 10th	11:12:59 PM	mahoonie    	You're old
2589	September 10th	11:14:27 PM	AshleyReyes1	heeey
2590	September 10th	11:15:13 PM	AshleyReyes1	I went to smoke
2591	September 10th	11:15:17 PM	AshleyReyes1	5 min
2592	September 10th	11:15:19 PM	mahoonie    	did I talk about work enough to get you excited and want to fuck me?
2593	September 10th	11:15:24 PM	mahoonie    	Don't smoke!
2594	September 10th	11:21:45 PM	AshleyReyes1	hahahahahah
2595	September 10th	11:22:06 PM	AshleyReyes1	thank you, but I'll smoke
2596	September 10th	11:22:38 PM	mahoonie    	It will wrinkle your beautiful face
2597	September 10th	11:22:40 PM	AshleyReyes1	Yes, I want more about work, I want a lot of thoughts in my head and get more excited hahah
2598	September 10th	11:22:47 PM	AshleyReyes1	yes
2599	September 10th	11:23:21 PM	AshleyReyes1	it will have a bad effect on my appearance, but there's nothing I can do about it
2600	September 10th	11:23:32 PM	mahoonie    	But it's not fair, I tell you everything about me, and you can't tell me anything
2601	September 10th	11:24:14 PM	AshleyReyes1	because we have different missions here
2602	September 10th	11:25:37 PM	mahoonie    	I know, it's just annoying, I want to know a lot about you too
2603	September 10th	11:25:51 PM	mahoonie    	Is there anything you can tell me?
2604	September 10th	11:27:28 PM	AshleyReyes1	I'd like to tell you a lot, but I can't
2605	September 10th	11:28:00 PM	mahoonie    	It's very similar to psychology no?
2606	September 10th	11:28:05 PM	mahoonie    	You just listen
2607	September 10th	11:28:14 PM	AshleyReyes1	yes
2608	September 10th	11:28:25 PM	mahoonie    	It's good practice
2609	September 10th	11:28:49 PM	AshleyReyes1	Yes, I could defend my diploma on this topic
2610	September 10th	11:29:00 PM	mahoonie    	Haha
2611	September 10th	11:29:11 PM	AshleyReyes1	the impact of porn sites on men or on me in particular
2612	September 10th	11:29:13 PM	mahoonie    	Wait, are you really studying psychology?
2613	September 10th	11:29:49 PM	mahoonie    	This website has great impact on me, I must say
2614	September 10th	11:31:51 PM	AshleyReyes1	Yes, I'm studying, why?
2615	September 10th	11:32:06 PM	mahoonie    	Because I don't know if you can tell me that
2616	September 10th	11:33:37 PM	AshleyReyes1	this is not such a secret information, otherwise I would not be able to communicate here at all, believe me, it is difficult for me to choose what I can say and what not
2617	September 10th	11:34:24 PM	mahoonie    	Cool, that's important, it says a lot about you
2618	September 10th	11:34:50 PM	mahoonie    	Mainly that you want to help people, and also that you are a little bit crazy
2619	September 10th	11:37:17 PM	AshleyReyes1	you don't know me enough to think I'm crazy B)
2620	September 10th	11:37:39 PM	mahoonie    	Takes one to know one
2621	September 10th	11:40:21 PM	AshleyReyes1	complex phrase
2622	September 10th	11:40:36 PM	mahoonie    	It takes one to know one
2623	September 10th	11:41:03 PM	mahoonie    	I can see your craziness because I'm a little bit crazy too
2624	September 10th	11:41:09 PM	AshleyReyes1	you tried to explain... in the same words hahahah
2625	September 10th	11:41:25 PM	AshleyReyes1	you are

2633	September 10th	11:46:10 PM	mahoonie    	And yesterday
2634	September 10th	11:46:16 PM	AshleyReyes1	yes
2635	September 10th	11:46:29 PM	AshleyReyes1	this is solely because of the top
2636	September 10th	11:46:30 PM	mahoonie    	And you like it
2637	September 10th	11:46:37 PM	AshleyReyes1	yes
2638	September 10th	11:46:41 PM	mahoonie    	So why not on Monday?
2639	September 10th	11:47:22 PM	AshleyReyes1	because in other clothes I will not be without a bra
2640	September 10th	11:47:24 PM	AshleyReyes1	B)

2693	September 11th	12:55:22 AM	AshleyReyes1	I'm afraid to show you my Tits because I don't think they're very good
2694	September 11th	12:55:31 AM	AshleyReyes1	that's the only reason

2745	September 14th	8:47:54 AM	mahoonie    	No question mark
2746	September 14th	8:48:33 AM	mahoonie    	Mine was so so, there are fires outside so the air quality is bad, so I had to stay inside
2747	September 14th	8:48:52 AM	AshleyReyes1	whyy?
2748	September 14th	8:49:38 AM	AshleyReyes1	I went to the movies, saw my friends for the first time in a long time
2749	September 14th	8:50:47 AM	mahoonie    	Cool!
2750	September 14th	8:51:47 AM	mahoonie    	I’m still a bit sad the weekend is over, but at least I have you during the week

2752	September 14th	8:54:39 AM	mahoonie    	What about “and I have you”
2753	September 14th	8:55:48 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes, i thought it was obvious
2754	September 14th	8:56:35 AM	mahoonie    	Nothing is obvious, you every day you forget me and just say “hi”

2763	September 14th	8:59:34 AM	mahoonie    	When are you back?

2768	September 14th	9:28:28 AM	AshleyReyes1	you probably don't understand, I don't want to do this, I thought about it over the weekend, and I think I won't do it again
2769	September 14th	9:28:43 AM	AshleyReyes1	I'm sorry if I upset or disappointed you
2770	September 14th	9:29:10 AM	mahoonie    	I thought you liked doing that with me
2771	September 14th	9:29:19 AM	AshleyReyes1	I'll spend the rest of my time here the same way I started here - just watching guys jerk off:flirt:
2772	September 14th	9:29:40 AM	AshleyReyes1	I think I had a lot of fun, but I need to stop
2773	September 14th	9:29:49 AM	AshleyReyes1	procrastination
2774	September 14th	9:29:58 AM	mahoonie    	Can’t we have one last time?
2775	September 14th	9:30:37 AM	AshleyReyes1	I decided that the last time was then
2776	September 14th	9:30:39 AM	AshleyReyes1	sorry
2777	September 14th	9:32:35 AM	mahoonie    	:(
2778	September 14th	9:40:59 AM	mahoonie    	I’m super sad, but I’m super happy I got to meet you. You truly are a special person in my opinion. I think that if we would meet there could really be something real between us... I still hope you’d like to keep in touch, I really like talking to you and enjoy our time together

2789	September 14th	9:48:42 AM	AshleyReyes1	do you just want to show off your amazing look? :P
2790	September 14th	9:49:35 AM	mahoonie    	Haha, I don’t look as good with my clothes on :)
2791	September 14th	9:50:08 AM	mahoonie    	But I like our c2c even without the sex
2792	September 14th	9:50:13 AM	AshleyReyes1	if you consider the fact that I've only seen you once in your clothes, I'll like it just as much
2793	September 14th	9:50:24 AM	AshleyReyes1	thank you, me too
2794	September 14th	9:53:08 AM	mahoonie    	So did you watch a lot of guys jerk off?

2796	September 14th	9:54:00 AM	AshleyReyes1	today?
2797	September 14th	9:54:07 AM	mahoonie    	On this site
2798	September 14th	9:54:19 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes..
2799	September 14th	9:55:42 AM	mahoonie    	Where do you rank me on the best jerker list?
2800	September 14th	9:55:56 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
2801	September 14th	9:56:19 AM	AshleyReyes1	I do not have such a list, I am not biased in this regard to anyone
2802	September 14th	9:56:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	I like to talk to you
2803	September 14th	9:56:42 AM	AshleyReyes1	but judging by the wank...
2804	September 14th	9:56:49 AM	AshleyReyes1	this is strange
2805	September 14th	9:57:05 AM	mahoonie    	No I mean overall
2806	September 14th	9:57:20 AM	mahoonie    	Not just the way we jerk off
2807	September 14th	9:57:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	I understand you, but I can't answer because it's a strange question
2808	September 14th	9:58:05 AM	mahoonie    	Really, you can’t even say if I’m in the top 10 favorite people on the site?
2809	September 14th	9:58:38 AM	AshleyReyes1	this is a very stupid question, even though you know how I feel about you
2810	September 14th	9:58:52 AM	AshleyReyes1	or are you asking for compliments? ;)
2811	September 14th	9:58:58 AM	mahoonie    	I don’t that’s the thing
2812	September 14th	9:59:30 AM	mahoonie    	I can tell you you are definitely my fav on this site
2813	September 14th	9:59:46 AM	AshleyReyes1	thank you, it's a pleasure
2814	September 14th	9:59:52 AM	mahoonie    	You are in my top 10 list in general, not just this site
2815	September 14th	10:00:28 AM	mahoonie    	You’re a truly good person
2816	September 14th	10:00:35 AM	AshleyReyes1	top 10 women in your life? ;)
2817	September 14th	10:00:35 AM	mahoonie    	Not many people are
2818	September 14th	10:00:43 AM	AshleyReyes1	thank you
2819	September 14th	10:01:05 AM	mahoonie    	Now can I please get my rank?
2820	September 14th	10:04:10 AM	AshleyReyes1	I like you and I don't have any lists lol
2821	September 14th	10:04:33 AM	AshleyReyes1	I never even thought about it
2822	September 14th	10:05:39 AM	mahoonie    	I never wrote a list, but I know that you are one of my favorite people
2823	September 14th	10:06:00 AM	mahoonie    	Like I don’t need an exact number
2824	September 14th	10:07:00 AM	AshleyReyes1	besides, it will be very bad if I write this to people, who is my first, who is in the top ten and who is the worst, I think so
2825	September 14th	10:07:22 AM	AshleyReyes1	I think that what I said about you will be enough ;)
2826	September 14th	10:07:45 AM	mahoonie    	Yeah definitely don’t write to the worst that
2827	September 14th	10:07:56 AM	mahoonie    	Oh wait, am I the worst?
2828	September 14th	10:08:16 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahahhah
2829	September 14th	10:08:31 AM	AshleyReyes1	you are definitely asking for compliments
2830	September 14th	10:09:38 AM	mahoonie    	I just want to know if it’s mutual, or am I just imagining
2831	September 14th	10:10:11 AM	AshleyReyes1	I told you many times and today I have already said that I think about you
2832	September 14th	10:10:23 AM	AshleyReyes1	so why are you torturing me still
2833	September 14th	10:10:44 AM	mahoonie    	Is it torture to tell me how you feel?
2834	September 14th	10:12:23 AM	AshleyReyes1	10 times - yes
2835	September 14th	10:13:14 AM	mahoonie    	I feel like you never actually said anything concrete, just indirectly
2836	September 14th	10:13:22 AM	mahoonie    	But I guess I understand
2837	September 14th	10:14:07 AM	mahoonie    	I’m your super favorite person and you’re in love with me and think about me all the time :)
2838	September 14th	10:21:36 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes :)
2839	September 14th	10:21:46 AM	mahoonie    	I knew it
2840	September 14th	10:22:04 AM	AshleyReyes1	Why do you ask then? still so persistently
2841	September 14th	10:22:18 AM	mahoonie    	Validation
2842	September 14th	10:22:26 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahha
2843	September 14th	10:24:47 AM	mahoonie    	Do you want to discuss what made you come to your decision?
2844	September 14th	10:26:34 AM	AshleyReyes1	are you curious about this?
2845	September 14th	10:26:41 AM	mahoonie    	Yes
2846	September 14th	10:28:13 AM	AshleyReyes1	I feel uncomfortable when I return home, I think it's understandable
2847	September 14th	10:28:39 AM	AshleyReyes1	this site is another planet, if I feel good here, then when I return home to another planet, I hate myself
2848	September 14th	10:28:58 AM	mahoonie    	Oh wow
2849	September 14th	10:29:43 AM	AshleyReyes1	and the men here warned me that for the first time I would be shy, and then I would undress, I resisted, and then it happened
2850	September 14th	10:30:00 AM	AshleyReyes1	I am disappointed in myself, I want to rehabilitate
2851	September 14th	10:33:03 AM	mahoonie    	I don’t think this makes you be any less of a good person
2852	September 14th	10:33:22 AM	mahoonie    	As I said you’re one of the truly good people I know
2853	September 14th	10:34:55 AM	AshleyReyes1	thanks, but honestly, I can't remember our conversation with you to understand why I am such a good person
2854	September 14th	10:35:09 AM	AshleyReyes1	although i know it i'm working on it hahahah
2855	September 14th	10:35:17 AM	mahoonie    	It’s something you you feel
2856	September 14th	10:35:19 AM	AshleyReyes1	sorry for such self-esteem
2857	September 14th	10:35:37 AM	mahoonie    	It’s hard to point at a specific thing I guess
2858	September 14th	10:36:09 AM	mahoonie    	Don’t you get a feeling about people just from talking to them?
2859	September 14th	10:37:45 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes, but I'm trying to understand you, and it doesn't quite work out, or rather, look through your eyes
2860	September 14th	10:38:27 AM	mahoonie    	What doesn’t work out?
2861	September 14th	10:39:32 AM	AshleyReyes1	I can't see myself through your eyes
2862	September 14th	10:40:07 AM	AshleyReyes1	never mind, in any case, I am very pleased to think so and I can assure you that you are not mistaken, no matter how arrogant it sounds lol
2863	September 14th	10:41:41 AM	mahoonie    	I think I have a good radar for good people
2864	September 14th	10:41:53 AM	mahoonie    	Maybe it takes one to know one :)
2865	September 14th	10:41:56 AM	AshleyReyes1	it's great B)
2866	September 14th	10:42:23 AM	mahoonie    	Like with gay people
2867	September 14th	10:42:45 AM	AshleyReyes1	what? hahah
2868	September 14th	10:43:06 AM	mahoonie    	Like gay people can identify other gay people
2869	September 14th	10:43:21 AM	mahoonie    	So good people can identify other good people
2870	September 14th	10:43:48 AM	AshleyReyes1	lol yes
2871	September 14th	11:16:02 AM	mahoonie    	So what do you do in private all the time?

2874	September 14th	11:17:18 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
2875	September 14th	11:17:35 AM	AshleyReyes1	I'm ashamed, but at least I'm just looking hahahah
2876	September 14th	11:18:20 AM	mahoonie    	Nothing to be ashamed of, I love watching woman masturbate
2877	September 14th	11:18:48 AM	mahoonie    	Watching your face when you finish is one of the most beautiful things I’ve seen
2878	September 14th	11:19:07 AM	AshleyReyes1	It's one thing to watch porn, it's another to do it with a live person online :)
2879	September 14th	11:19:14 AM	AshleyReyes1	mmmm

2887	September 14th	11:27:31 AM	AshleyReyes1	for an hour he asks me what to wear, he shows me his wardrobe
2888	September 14th	11:27:43 AM	mahoonie    	Haha

2894	September 14th	11:28:32 AM	mahoonie    	Because if you think it looks good, probably it looks good
2895	September 14th	11:28:43 AM	AshleyReyes1	oh thanks
2896	September 14th	11:28:48 AM	mahoonie    	It’s good to have a beautiful girl’s opinion

2924	September 14th	11:37:34 AM	mahoonie    	But life is not always fair

3063	September 14th	12:23:45 PM	mahoonie    	I can’t refuse you, but I won’t masturbate
3064	September 14th	12:24:26 PM	AshleyReyes1	because you're having sex with a real woman? ;)
3065	September 14th	12:25:11 PM	mahoonie    	No, because it’s not good day after day
3066	September 14th	12:25:33 PM	AshleyReyes1	that is, you don't masturbate every day?
3067	September 14th	12:25:58 PM	mahoonie    	Yes usually 2 3 times a week
3068	September 14th	12:26:33 PM	mahoonie    	You?
3069	September 14th	12:26:33 PM	AshleyReyes1	I adore you (again)
3070	September 14th	12:26:49 PM	AshleyReyes1	it happens in my mood
3071	September 14th	12:27:22 PM	mahoonie    	Why what did I say?
3072	September 14th	12:27:39 PM	AshleyReyes1	what?
3073	September 14th	12:28:32 PM	mahoonie    	You adore me for only doing that 2 3 times a week?
3074	September 14th	12:28:45 PM	mahoonie    	If I do it more will you adore me more?
3075	September 14th	12:29:00 PM	AshleyReyes1	yes, I like it when men are not obsessed and do not do it every day
3076	September 14th	12:29:07 PM	AshleyReyes1	nooo
3077	September 14th	12:29:38 PM	mahoonie    	And if I do it less?
3078	September 14th	12:29:55 PM	AshleyReyes1	I will like it even more
3079	September 14th	12:30:13 PM	AshleyReyes1	I don't even want to explain why it is so important to me
3080	September 14th	12:31:19 PM	mahoonie    	So if I don’t do it ever again you will love me the most?
3081	September 14th	12:31:46 PM	AshleyReyes1	hahahahah
3082	September 14th	12:32:10 PM	AshleyReyes1	just if we lived together, I would like to jerk you off myself
3083	September 14th	12:32:23 PM	AshleyReyes1	and would not let you touch your dick
3084	September 14th	12:32:36 PM	mahoonie    	Sounds like a plan
3085	September 14th	12:32:49 PM	AshleyReyes1	but since we are in such a situation, I would like you to jerk off sometimes B)
3086	September 14th	12:32:53 PM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
3087	September 14th	12:33:13 PM	mahoonie    	But why jerk me off and not sex?
3088	September 14th	12:33:58 PM	AshleyReyes1	because I like to do it and watch it, probably more than sex
3089	September 14th	12:34:05 PM	AshleyReyes1	I'm not kidding
3090	September 14th	12:34:13 PM	mahoonie    	Really?

3138	September 15th	8:21:58 AM	AshleyReyes1	lol
3139	September 15th	8:22:11 AM	AshleyReyes1	we talked about it yesterday
3140	September 15th	8:22:30 AM	mahoonie    	You said whenever you feel like it
3141	September 15th	8:22:40 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
3142	September 15th	8:22:42 AM	AshleyReyes1	and?

3144	September 15th	8:22:56 AM	mahoonie    	More than me?
3145	September 15th	8:22:59 AM	AshleyReyes1	always different
3146	September 15th	8:23:09 AM	AshleyReyes1	I think this is personal information
3147	September 15th	8:23:18 AM	mahoonie    	It is
3148	September 15th	8:23:26 AM	AshleyReyes1	I can't report to you after every time
3149	September 15th	8:23:27 AM	mahoonie    	But I told you my number
3150	September 15th	8:23:56 AM	mahoonie    	Because you wanted to know
3151	September 15th	8:24:05 AM	AshleyReyes1	but it was your decision to speak or not
3152	September 15th	8:24:16 AM	AshleyReyes1	I consider it personal information
3153	September 15th	8:24:20 AM	mahoonie    	You were so happy when I told you
3154	September 15th	8:24:38 AM	AshleyReyes1	I liked what I learned
3155	September 15th	8:24:51 AM	AshleyReyes1	but you could say that you don't want to answer and I would understand
3156	September 15th	8:25:04 AM	mahoonie    	Not fair
3157	September 15th	8:25:04 AM	AshleyReyes1	but you never seem to be embarrassed :)
3158	September 15th	8:25:25 AM	AshleyReyes1	it's fair if you understand each other
3159	September 15th	8:25:49 AM	mahoonie    	Did you jerk off yesterday?
3160	September 15th	8:26:23 AM	AshleyReyes1	and I will not answer such questions either ;)
3161	September 15th	8:26:37 AM	mahoonie    	Did you think about me?
3162	September 15th	8:26:56 AM	AshleyReyes1	I came home and fell asleep almost immediately
3163	September 15th	8:27:14 AM	AshleyReyes1	there were a lot of things to do today, but when I came here, I thought about you
3164	September 15th	8:27:48 AM	mahoonie    	So you didn’t jerk off, good girl
3165	September 15th	8:28:09 AM	AshleyReyes1	I did not say  :P
3166	September 15th	8:28:17 AM	AshleyReyes1	that
3167	September 15th	8:28:52 AM	mahoonie    	You did, you fell asleep and today you had a lot to do
3168	September 15th	8:29:28 AM	AshleyReyes1	it doesn't take long hahahah
3169	September 15th	8:29:59 AM	mahoonie    	Who do you usually think about when you do it?
3170	September 15th	8:30:22 AM	AshleyReyes1	it always happens differently
3171	September 15th	8:30:31 AM	AshleyReyes1	and these are personal topics
3172	September 15th	8:31:04 AM	mahoonie    	I thought we share our personal lives
3173	September 15th	8:31:40 AM	AshleyReyes1	it means I'm not in the mood to discuss it, it seems to me that personal information is being pulled out of me, an uncomfortable feeling
3174	September 15th	8:31:53 AM	mahoonie    	Ok
3175	September 15th	8:32:14 AM	mahoonie    	What do you want to talk about?
3176	September 15th	8:32:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	and this strange question
3177	September 15th	8:32:39 AM	AshleyReyes1	after which the brain breaks
3178	September 15th	8:32:52 AM	AshleyReyes1	are you going to work now?
3179	September 15th	8:33:07 AM	mahoonie    	I’m working from home
3180	September 15th	8:33:15 AM	mahoonie    	Because of the virus
3181	September 15th	8:33:40 AM	AshleyReyes1	I knooow
3182	September 15th	8:33:54 AM	AshleyReyes1	I mean have you already started working?

3198	September 15th	8:37:02 AM	AshleyReyes1	did it wake you up?

3212	September 15th	9:07:07 AM	mahoonie    	I like it
3213	September 15th	9:07:52 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes hahaha
3214	September 15th	9:09:24 AM	mahoonie    	Are you less busy because of your new rules?
3215	September 15th	9:09:44 AM	AshleyReyes1	no, every day is different
3216	September 15th	9:09:57 AM	AshleyReyes1	I think I wrote this many times today hahah
3217	September 15th	9:10:19 AM	mahoonie    	Really? Many people ask that?
3218	September 15th	9:10:53 AM	AshleyReyes1	I wrote to you many times
3219	September 15th	9:11:02 AM	AshleyReyes1	that everything is always different
3220	September 15th	9:11:11 AM	mahoonie    	Oh

3222	September 15th	9:12:20 AM	AshleyReyes1	my memory too
3223	September 15th	9:12:33 AM	mahoonie    	Too much cannabis
3224	September 15th	9:12:48 AM	mahoonie    	(When I was younger)
3225	September 15th	9:13:06 AM	AshleyReyes1	omg
3226	September 15th	9:13:18 AM	AshleyReyes1	I have never taken anything
3227	September 15th	9:13:27 AM	mahoonie    	I was a rebel
3228	September 15th	9:13:36 AM	mahoonie    	Good
3229	September 15th	9:13:42 AM	mahoonie    	But you drink?
3230	September 15th	9:14:55 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
3231	September 15th	9:14:59 AM	AshleyReyes1	and smoke
3232	September 15th	9:15:18 AM	mahoonie    	Smoking is way worse than cannabis
3233	September 15th	9:16:13 AM	mahoonie    	And actually, Ashley, or Anastasia, I think everyone should try everything at least once
3234	September 15th	9:16:52 AM	AshleyReyes1	Anastasia?
3235	September 15th	9:20:27 AM	AshleyReyes1	I believe that at least someone should refrain from such things
3236	September 15th	9:20:45 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes, I'm a moralphage and I don't know what I'm doing here
3237	September 15th	9:21:24 AM	mahoonie    	I checked what’s the most common name in Russia :)
3238	September 15th	9:21:36 AM	mahoonie    	And I think it kind of fits you
3239	September 15th	9:22:15 AM	AshleyReyes1	I'm already tired of this Russia, it seems to me I have never heard so much about it in my life, as with you here
3240	September 15th	9:22:37 AM	AshleyReyes1	i think my real name is much prettier
3241	September 15th	9:22:50 AM	mahoonie    	I wish I knew it
3242	September 15th	9:23:29 AM	mahoonie    	And I think that there’s a right amount to everything
3243	September 15th	9:23:53 AM	AshleyReyes1	what does it mean?
3244	September 15th	9:25:03 AM	mahoonie    	Like, there’s too much for everything and also too little
3245	September 15th	9:25:25 AM	mahoonie    	If you consume alcohol moderately it’s good
3246	September 15th	9:25:27 AM	AshleyReyes1	what is it written for?
3247	September 15th	9:25:33 AM	AshleyReyes1	aaah
3248	September 15th	9:25:53 AM	mahoonie    	Yeah 2 conversations
3249	September 15th	9:26:19 AM	AshleyReyes1	I know that natural weed is better than cigarettes, but I was probably brought up so that all substances are bad, including smoking, at least it's legal lol
3250	September 15th	9:26:34 AM	AshleyReyes1	and I will not go to jail for this
3251	September 15th	9:27:44 AM	mahoonie    	You know where it’s legal?
3252	September 15th	9:29:05 AM	AshleyReyes1	yesss
3253	September 15th	9:29:07 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
3254	September 15th	9:29:18 AM	AshleyReyes1	but i don't need it, thanks
3255	September 15th	9:29:39 AM	AshleyReyes1	but I don't mind leaving to hot programmers
3256	September 15th	9:30:54 AM	mahoonie    	With bad memory
3257	September 15th	9:31:10 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahhaha yes
3258	September 15th	9:31:18 AM	mahoonie    	So what’s your favorite drink?
3259	September 15th	9:32:30 AM	AshleyReyes1	I like hard liquor like whiskey or rum, gin
3260	September 15th	9:32:45 AM	AshleyReyes1	in extreme cases, semi-sweet red wine
3261	September 15th	9:33:05 AM	mahoonie    	Haha, what do you mean extreme cases?
3262	September 15th	9:33:41 AM	AshleyReyes1	if something went wrong at the party and my favorite alcohol is not present
3263	September 15th	9:35:04 AM	mahoonie    	I like beer (not that you asked :)
3264	September 15th	9:35:15 AM	mahoonie    	Because I can drink that all night
3265	September 15th	9:35:29 AM	mahoonie    	With hard liquor I get wasted too fast
3266	September 15th	9:35:30 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
3267	September 15th	9:36:20 AM	AshleyReyes1	I didn't ask you now because I thought you didn't drink
3268	September 15th	9:36:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	I don't know why I decided so
3269	September 15th	9:38:00 AM	mahoonie    	You think I’m a hard core nerd
3270	September 15th	9:39:04 AM	AshleyReyes1	that would be awesome, although I don't like people who don't drink hahah
3271	September 15th	9:40:01 AM	mahoonie    	You like nerds?
3272	September 15th	9:41:12 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
3273	September 15th	9:41:55 AM	mahoonie    	Is that why you like me?
3274	September 15th	9:42:22 AM	AshleyReyes1	Yes, probably B)
3275	September 15th	9:44:28 AM	mahoonie    	Bad ass nerd

3279	September 15th	9:50:13 AM	AshleyReyes1	I like it when a man is always sitting at a computer and I see his back 24/7
3280	September 15th	9:50:34 AM	AshleyReyes1	come up periodically and hug, pester hahah
3281	September 15th	9:51:17 AM	mahoonie    	Sounds like the good life

3283	September 15th	9:51:53 AM	AshleyReyes1	bring coffee, ask to remove my hands from the table when I dust off hahah
3284	September 15th	9:52:07 AM	mahoonie    	Pester is like annoy no?
3285	September 15th	9:52:08 AM	AshleyReyes1	ideally
3286	September 15th	9:52:19 AM	AshleyReyes1	what?
3287	September 15th	9:52:23 AM	mahoonie    	That’s very specific
3288	September 15th	9:52:37 AM	mahoonie    	You said “pester”
3289	September 15th	9:53:14 AM	AshleyReyes1	I meant - that I climb to hug, touch in all places, kiss
3290	September 15th	9:53:31 AM	mahoonie    	Oh I like that
3291	September 15th	9:57:20 AM	mahoonie    	Is this just your imagination or did you have something like that?
3292	September 15th	9:58:04 AM	AshleyReyes1	Yes, I did, and I think it's perfect
3293	September 15th	9:58:15 AM	mahoonie    	So what happened?
3294	September 15th	9:59:24 AM	AshleyReyes1	this man studied and worked in the specialty and he had no money, I brought all the money
3295	September 15th	9:59:35 AM	AshleyReyes1	I'm sick of it
3296	September 15th	10:00:18 AM	mahoonie    	You know who does bring money?
3297	September 15th	10:00:18 AM	AshleyReyes1	I found out recently that he has risen very well at work and now earns well, and he graduated with honors from the master's program
3298	September 15th	10:00:20 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
3299	September 15th	10:00:27 AM	AshleyReyes1	HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
3300	September 15th	10:01:01 AM	mahoonie    	So you missed out, yeah university is a tough time, you feel so poor
3301	September 15th	10:01:50 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
3302	September 15th	10:02:16 AM	AshleyReyes1	but we have mutual friends and I know he has feelings for me
3303	September 15th	10:02:28 AM	AshleyReyes1	but it doesn't matter
3304	September 15th	10:02:37 AM	mahoonie    	Why not?
3305	September 15th	10:02:55 AM	mahoonie    	Because you are in love with someone else ;)
3306	September 15th	10:03:10 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
3307	September 15th	10:04:03 AM	mahoonie    	Why not?
3308	September 15th	10:04:04 AM	AshleyReyes1	what I wrote you about the reason for our separation... it doesn't really sound so Mercantile, it's probably one of the reasons, but it's more convenient for me to say it
3309	September 15th	10:04:17 AM	AshleyReyes1	so don't think badly of me
3310	September 15th	10:07:09 AM	mahoonie    	For some reason I can’t think badly of you
3311	September 15th	10:07:30 AM	AshleyReyes1	unexpected and pleasant
3312	September 15th	10:07:57 AM	mahoonie    	Really unexpected? You know what I think about you
3313	September 15th	10:08:47 AM	AshleyReyes1	I thought that after my story you would change your mind about me
3314	September 15th	10:09:51 AM	mahoonie    	I feel I know you better than just one story
3315	September 15th	10:11:05 AM	AshleyReyes1	I don't even know what to say...
3316	September 15th	10:11:56 AM	mahoonie    	When you don’t know what to say you can say mmmm Jordan  take me now
3317	September 15th	10:12:41 AM	AshleyReyes1	why is everything going to sex with you hahah
3318	September 15th	10:12:58 AM	mahoonie    	I didn’t say sex
3319	September 15th	10:13:09 AM	mahoonie    	I can take you to many places

3343	September 15th	10:30:19 AM	mahoonie    	There’s a new watch, it tells you how much oxygen you have in your blood
3344	September 15th	10:30:32 AM	AshleyReyes1	omg
3345	September 15th	10:30:48 AM	AshleyReyes1	I recently saw such programs exposed
3346	September 15th	10:30:59 AM	AshleyReyes1	reviews are just awful
3347	September 15th	10:31:11 AM	AshleyReyes1	but it's not about Apple
3348	September 15th	10:31:28 AM	mahoonie    	Apple does everything better 8)
3349	September 15th	10:32:25 AM	AshleyReyes1	I've heard about it
3350	September 15th	10:32:42 AM	AshleyReyes1	but oxygen in the blood ... this is too much hahah
3351	September 15th	10:34:01 AM	AshleyReyes1	do you have anything to do with this program? Or do you exclusively work with Siri?
3352	September 15th	10:35:57 AM	mahoonie    	That’s your limit? Lol
3353	September 15th	10:36:20 AM	AshleyReyes1	whhaaatt?
3354	September 15th	10:37:32 AM	mahoonie    	Why is it too much?
3355	September 15th	10:39:16 AM	AshleyReyes1	I don't know how to explain this word
3356	September 15th	10:39:23 AM	AshleyReyes1	or do you understand?
3357	September 15th	10:40:00 AM	mahoonie    	Like you mean it in a good way or a bad way?
3358	September 15th	10:40:33 AM	AshleyReyes1	in a strange way
3359	September 15th	10:40:42 AM	mahoonie    	It is strange
3360	September 15th	10:41:18 AM	mahoonie    	But it will only get more strange I think
3361	September 15th	10:41:59 AM	mahoonie    	There’s a company that’s making a chip to connect to your brain
3362	September 15th	10:42:17 AM	AshleyReyes1	lol
3363	September 15th	10:42:22 AM	AshleyReyes1	but whyy
3364	September 15th	10:42:48 AM	AshleyReyes1	they just prove everywhere that it doesn't work
3365	September 15th	10:42:56 AM	mahoonie    	In the end it is so we can upload our brain and live forever I hope
3366	September 15th	10:43:06 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahhahaha
3367	September 15th	10:43:37 AM	AshleyReyes1	or are they Masson chips after all
3368	September 15th	10:44:02 AM	mahoonie    	Masson chip?
3369	September 15th	10:44:20 AM	AshleyReyes1	don't tell me you don't know...
3370	September 15th	10:44:46 AM	AshleyReyes1	the Illuminati
3371	September 15th	10:44:59 AM	mahoonie    	Oh free masons?
3372	September 15th	10:45:27 AM	AshleyReyes1	Yes, the Freemasons
3373	September 15th	10:45:37 AM	AshleyReyes1	sorry
3374	September 15th	10:45:39 AM	mahoonie    	Do you think it’s true?
3375	September 15th	10:46:02 AM	AshleyReyes1	this causes paranoia if you study it for a long time
3376	September 15th	10:46:36 AM	mahoonie    	But because I work inside that, I’m less afraid
3377	September 15th	10:47:46 AM	AshleyReyes1	what are you working inside?
3378	September 15th	10:48:14 AM	mahoonie    	Like people are afraid of high tech and chips and stuff
3379	September 15th	10:48:23 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahahah
3380	September 15th	10:48:39 AM	mahoonie    	Not Freemasons lol
3381	September 15th	10:48:51 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahhahaha
3382	September 15th	10:48:57 AM	AshleyReyes1	Yes, because we were once intimidated by it
3383	September 15th	10:49:01 AM	mahoonie    	Inside the big tech company
3384	September 15th	10:49:39 AM	mahoonie    	I am a little afraid of AI
3385	September 15th	10:49:50 AM	mahoonie    	It’s getting so smart so fast
3386	September 15th	10:49:53 AM	AshleyReyes1	all authorities always want to have control over ordinary people, over all people, I think that it is very likely that new technologies are used for this
3387	September 15th	10:50:08 AM	AshleyReyes1	what is it
3388	September 15th	10:50:19 AM	mahoonie    	Artificial intelligence
3389	September 15th	10:50:24 AM	mahoonie    	Like Siri
3390	September 15th	10:50:32 AM	mahoonie    	Siri is stupid now
3391	September 15th	10:50:33 AM	AshleyReyes1	aaah
3392	September 15th	10:50:41 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahahha
3393	September 15th	10:50:53 AM	mahoonie    	But in 10 years she could be smarter than us
3394	September 15th	11:09:22 AM	AshleyReyes1	it doesn't frighten me, but the fact that the government can listen to me-it annoys me
3395	September 15th	11:09:57 AM	mahoonie    	Are you more afraid of a government or a company?
3396	September 15th	11:10:10 AM	AshleyReyes1	government
3397	September 15th	11:10:28 AM	AshleyReyes1	depends on what you mean by company
3398	September 15th	11:10:46 AM	mahoonie    	But it’s chosen by the people, company is more like a dictatorship
3399	September 15th	11:11:08 AM	AshleyReyes1	what company are we talking about? lol
3400	September 15th	11:11:15 AM	mahoonie    	Apple?
3401	September 15th	11:11:19 AM	AshleyReyes1	maybe I don't understand something
3402	September 15th	11:11:20 AM	AshleyReyes1	aah
3403	September 15th	11:11:33 AM	AshleyReyes1	your company works for the government
3404	September 15th	11:11:44 AM	mahoonie    	Or google, or Microsoft, or Amazon
3405	September 15th	11:11:44 AM	AshleyReyes1	the company is also a puppet
3406	September 15th	11:11:52 AM	AshleyReyes1	like all of us
3407	September 15th	11:12:39 AM	mahoonie    	Actually, Ashley, Apple was in the news because they didn’t let the FBI access to a phone of a terrorist
3408	September 15th	11:13:03 AM	AshleyReyes1	then I take it back
3409	September 15th	11:13:17 AM	AshleyReyes1	because I just didn't know
3410	September 15th	11:13:44 AM	AshleyReyes1	I thought that such a large, global organization should work for the government and not for one government
3411	September 15th	11:14:07 AM	mahoonie    	Yeah, I like Apple, I feel like they try to do the right thing
3412	September 15th	11:14:20 AM	mahoonie    	But yeah all companies care about profit
3413	September 15th	11:14:35 AM	mahoonie    	And not always about us
3414	September 15th	11:14:44 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
3415	September 15th	11:15:46 AM	mahoonie    	Btw, it took you some time to get back after c2c now... do you still get undressed?
3416	September 15th	11:15:56 AM	AshleyReyes1	no
3417	September 15th	11:16:04 AM	AshleyReyes1	I went to smoke
3418	September 15th	11:16:23 AM	mahoonie    	Haha, like after sex?
3419	September 15th	11:16:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah yes
3420	September 15th	11:16:33 AM	AshleyReyes1	but today I was in my underwear in one private chat
3421	September 15th	11:16:46 AM	AshleyReyes1	but I didn't do anything
3422	September 15th	11:16:51 AM	mahoonie    	Why not with me?
3423	September 15th	11:17:05 AM	AshleyReyes1	yersteday?
3424	September 15th	11:17:16 AM	mahoonie    	For example
3425	September 15th	11:17:40 AM	AshleyReyes1	yesterday I was categorical, just like today, but it was necessary today
3426	September 15th	11:18:00 AM	mahoonie    	Why was it necessary?
3427	September 15th	11:18:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	it's hard for me to explain to a person why I used to be able to undress but now I can't
3428	September 15th	11:19:30 AM	AshleyReyes1	to be precise, I just pulled up my t-shirt and was wearing a bra
3429	September 15th	11:19:59 AM	mahoonie    	Oh, well, I don’t know if you noticed but you did it for me to
3430	September 15th	11:20:15 AM	mahoonie    	Maybe you couldn’t resist me
3431	September 15th	11:20:24 AM	mahoonie    	:P
3432	September 15th	11:20:27 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes B)
3433	September 15th	11:21:38 AM	mahoonie    	So after c2c you go for smoke?

3905	September 16th	11:12:38 AM	AshleyReyes1	have you ever met a celebrity there?
3906	September 16th	11:12:52 AM	AshleyReyes1	unfortunately you don't smoke
3907	September 16th	11:13:04 AM	mahoonie    	I did smoke
3908	September 16th	11:13:13 AM	mahoonie    	That’s how I got all the wrinkles
3909	September 16th	11:13:37 AM	mahoonie    	Most of the celebrities are in LA
3910	September 16th	11:13:39 AM	AshleyReyes1	apart from a beard I saw nothing there
3911	September 16th	11:14:00 AM	AshleyReyes1	have you been to LA?
3912	September 16th	11:14:04 AM	mahoonie    	Yes

3914	September 16th	11:15:00 AM	AshleyReyes1	I am? lol
3915	September 16th	11:15:02 AM	mahoonie    	But I don’t remember seeing anyone too famous
3916	September 16th	11:15:20 AM	AshleyReyes1	and who for example?
3917	September 16th	11:15:20 AM	mahoonie    	I don’t know why I keep putting question marks lol
3918	September 16th	11:16:00 AM	mahoonie    	I don’t even know the names, it’s people you say hey he was at that show
3919	September 16th	11:16:21 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahahah
3920	September 16th	11:16:46 AM	mahoonie    	But I’m also not very good with celebrities
3921	September 16th	11:17:01 AM	mahoonie    	I don’t watch too many movies and tv
3922	September 16th	11:17:05 AM	mahoonie    	Do you?
3923	September 16th	11:17:38 AM	AshleyReyes1	oh god .. i don't like movies either
3924	September 16th	11:17:50 AM	AshleyReyes1	mostly friends make me watch
3925	September 16th	11:18:07 AM	mahoonie    	Why not?
3926	September 16th	11:18:36 AM	mahoonie    	I didn’t say I don’t like it, but it’s just that I don’t know what to watch
3927	September 16th	11:18:44 AM	mahoonie    	It’s a big commitment
3928	September 16th	11:18:59 AM	mahoonie    	And it’s hard for me to stop in the middle
3929	September 16th	11:19:57 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
3930	September 16th	11:22:06 AM	mahoonie    	You didn’t answer
3931	September 16th	11:23:47 AM	AshleyReyes1	what?
3932	September 16th	11:26:39 AM	mahoonie    	Why don’t you like movies?
3933	September 16th	11:27:44 AM	AshleyReyes1	I don't know, I think it's a waste of time
3934	September 16th	11:28:26 AM	mahoonie    	Such a focused woman
3935	September 16th	11:28:44 AM	mahoonie    	You need to rest sometimes
3936	September 16th	11:29:39 AM	AshleyReyes1	i know, but not this way
3937	September 16th	11:30:02 AM	mahoonie    	You probably read books 8)
3938	September 16th	11:32:02 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes, but I haven't read it for a long time, because of this site just
3939	September 16th	11:32:23 AM	mahoonie    	Do you want me to tell you a story then?
3940	September 16th	11:32:25 AM	AshleyReyes1	although on the Internet I always read something, but it doesn't count hahah
3941	September 16th	11:34:52 AM	mahoonie    	Do you want me to tell you a story then?
3942	September 16th	11:35:16 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
3943	September 16th	11:35:57 AM	mahoonie    	You asked me how I got here
3944	September 16th	11:36:05 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
3945	September 16th	11:37:05 AM	mahoonie    	I studied my Masters degree in Israel, and my work was to teach machines how to solve questions by themselves
3946	September 16th	11:37:21 AM	AshleyReyes1	wow
3947	September 16th	11:37:23 AM	mahoonie    	I went to this conference, and they had a mailing list
3948	September 16th	11:37:31 AM	AshleyReyes1	how long has it been?
3949	September 16th	11:37:42 AM	mahoonie    	5 years ago I think
3950	September 16th	11:37:53 AM	mahoonie    	Wait
3951	September 16th	11:37:54 AM	AshleyReyes1	good... and
3952	September 16th	11:38:12 AM	mahoonie    	So, they posted this job at Apple
3953	September 16th	11:38:30 AM	mahoonie    	I thought it was in Israel, because the conference was in israel
3954	September 16th	11:38:47 AM	mahoonie    	So I did all the interviews, and I passed
3955	September 16th	11:39:10 AM	mahoonie    	And then the recruiter calls me and says I got the job
3956	September 16th	11:39:42 AM	mahoonie    	But to move to the states I first need to stay in Paris for a year
3957	September 16th	11:40:22 AM	mahoonie    	I didn’t even know it was in the states
3958	September 16th	11:40:45 AM	mahoonie    	So I thought about it for like a minute, and said yes
3959	September 16th	11:40:52 AM	mahoonie    	Paris is beautiful
3960	September 16th	11:41:08 AM	mahoonie    	And San Francisco is awesome so why not
3961	September 16th	11:41:33 AM	mahoonie    	And it’s super interesting stuff (like teach a machine to talk to people)
3962	September 16th	11:41:51 AM	mahoonie    	(And it’s good money)
3963	September 16th	11:42:00 AM	mahoonie    	Fin
3964	September 16th	11:42:28 AM	AshleyReyes1	it was amazing, but why did you have to live in Paris for a year?
3965	September 16th	11:42:39 AM	AshleyReyes1	did your family stop you?
3966	September 16th	11:42:42 AM	mahoonie    	For the visa
3967	September 16th	11:43:22 AM	mahoonie    	You can’t directly move to the US for a company without a green card,
3968	September 16th	11:43:31 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
3969	September 16th	11:43:40 AM	mahoonie    	You know?
3970	September 16th	11:43:43 AM	AshleyReyes1	did you work there too? in Paris?
3971	September 16th	11:43:46 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
3972	September 16th	11:43:49 AM	mahoonie    	Yes
3973	September 16th	11:43:58 AM	mahoonie    	Same job, but in Paris
3974	September 16th	11:43:59 AM	AshleyReyes1	I thought it only applies to Canada
3975	September 16th	11:44:08 AM	mahoonie    	It was fun
3976	September 16th	11:44:23 AM	mahoonie    	All the new people stayed in Paris for a year
3977	September 16th	11:44:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	did you go to a foreign country alone?
3978	September 16th	11:44:33 AM	mahoonie    	We didn’t have adult supervision
3979	September 16th	11:45:09 AM	mahoonie    	My parents are not super happy that I left, but they are happy for this opportunity
3980	September 16th	11:45:39 AM	AshleyReyes1	I think that now they are very proud of you
3981	September 16th	11:45:52 AM	AshleyReyes1	but not because you are on this site hahah
3982	September 16th	11:46:24 AM	mahoonie    	I think this site is way more moral then porn
3983	September 16th	11:46:57 AM	mahoonie    	Porn is “free”, but that’s because the actors are not compensated
3984	September 16th	11:46:58 AM	AshleyReyes1	I think it's the same thing because it's a porn site
3985	September 16th	11:47:15 AM	mahoonie    	Here you get to give directly to the people you like
3986	September 16th	11:48:21 AM	AshleyReyes1	i watch desperate housewives and there was a series of how Susan accidentally got on webcam
3987	September 16th	11:48:32 AM	AshleyReyes1	everything is the same there
3988	September 16th	11:48:48 AM	AshleyReyes1	and it was always considered immoral :)
3989	September 16th	11:49:02 AM	AshleyReyes1	I felt funny and ashamed to watch this episode :D
3990	September 16th	11:49:23 AM	mahoonie    	And porn is not a bad thing, sex is not a bad thing, our culture is trying to make that feel wrong because children shouldn’t do it
3991	September 16th	11:49:33 AM	mahoonie    	I need to watch it now
3992	September 16th	11:49:44 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
3993	September 16th	11:50:05 AM	mahoonie    	But we’re adults
3994	September 16th	11:50:19 AM	mahoonie    	(Even though you’re only 21 :)
3995	September 16th	11:50:34 AM	AshleyReyes1	I know that we are trying to bind aversion to sex, despite the fact that the whole world is tied to sexual relations, ex is everywhere, but still there should be moral
3996	September 16th	11:50:42 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
3997	September 16th	11:51:11 AM	mahoonie    	I don’t see why it’s not moral
3998	September 16th	11:51:48 AM	AshleyReyes1	if your daughter or wife did it, would you feel good?
3999	September 16th	11:52:04 AM	AshleyReyes1	if she was in porn or working as a web cam model
4000	September 16th	11:54:30 AM	mahoonie    	If my daughter is under 18 no, but over 18 no problem
4001	September 16th	11:56:24 AM	mahoonie    	A married woman should probably not work in porn or web cams
4002	September 16th	11:56:56 AM	mahoonie    	But you’re not married right and over 18
4003	September 16th	12:00:44 PM	AshleyReyes1	no, it doesn't work like that
4004	September 16th	12:01:02 PM	mahoonie    	Tell me
4005	September 16th	12:07:47 PM	AshleyReyes1	you yourself understand that this is not normal, there is nothing to explain
4006	September 16th	12:08:12 PM	mahoonie    	I don’t, I’m speaking from my heart
4007	September 16th	12:08:21 PM	mahoonie    	When did I lie?
4008	September 16th	12:09:16 PM	AshleyReyes1	I think that this is wrong, I condemned people like me and here I am now, so I have nothing more to say
4009	September 16th	12:09:29 PM	mahoonie    	:/
4010	September 16th	12:09:43 PM	mahoonie    	Ok
4011	September 16th	12:09:49 PM	mahoonie    	Agree to disagree
4012	September 16th	12:12:22 PM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah oka
4013	September 16th	12:12:27 PM	AshleyReyes1	y
4014	September 16th	12:15:44 PM	mahoonie    	So to answer your question, I think my parents would be concerned if I never watched porn :)
4015	September 16th	12:16:28 PM	mahoonie    	Want to hear something embarrassing?
4016	September 16th	12:17:06 PM	AshleyReyes1	yes
4017	September 16th	12:17:09 PM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
4018	September 16th	12:17:24 PM	mahoonie    	But please still like me after that
4019	September 16th	12:17:37 PM	mahoonie    	I want to stay your favorite cock
4020	September 16th	12:18:26 PM	AshleyReyes1	was that what you wanted to say?
4021	September 16th	12:19:46 PM	AshleyReyes1	did you doubt that you are my favorite cock?
4022	September 16th	12:21:04 PM	mahoonie    	Well I don’t know for sure, but I think I’m in a good place, you wouldn’t lie that much
4023	September 16th	12:22:24 PM	AshleyReyes1	I have nothing to lie to you, you are perfect
4024	September 16th	12:22:39 PM	mahoonie    	I’m far from perfect
4025	September 16th	12:22:39 PM	AshleyReyes1	at least at the stage at which I know you
4026	September 16th	12:23:38 PM	mahoonie    	Well this story will probably change your mind
4027	September 16th	12:23:47 PM	mahoonie    	I don’t know if to tell it now
4028	September 16th	12:26:05 PM	AshleyReyes1	whaat?
4029	September 16th	12:27:04 PM	mahoonie    	When I was young, if there was a girl I liked, I would use photoshop to put her face on a porn figure...
4030	September 16th	12:27:23 PM	AshleyReyes1	wow
4031	September 16th	12:27:24 PM	mahoonie    	That’s the nerdiest porn I know
4032	September 16th	12:27:37 PM	AshleyReyes1	HAHAHAHH
4033	September 16th	12:27:42 PM	mahoonie    	See not perfect at all
4034	September 16th	12:27:44 PM	AshleyReyes1	on a video or also on a photo?
4035	September 16th	12:27:58 PM	mahoonie    	When I was young we only had photos
4036	September 16th	12:28:32 PM	AshleyReyes1	so that's where your passion for computers and software comes from
4037	September 16th	12:28:42 PM	AshleyReyes1	sorry to laugh, it's funny
4038	September 16th	12:28:43 PM	mahoonie    	HAHAHAHA
4039	September 16th	12:29:09 PM	mahoonie    	It’s ok I’m laughing at myself too
4040	September 16th	12:29:26 PM	AshleyReyes1	did anyone see this?
4041	September 16th	12:29:52 PM	mahoonie    	I think yes, because someone deleted it
4042	September 16th	12:30:32 PM	AshleyReyes1	did you post this somewhere else???
4043	September 16th	12:31:10 PM	mahoonie    	Post what? The photos?
4044	September 16th	12:31:20 PM	mahoonie    	No, on our home computer
4045	September 16th	12:31:49 PM	AshleyReyes1	aaah

4056	September 16th	12:36:55 PM	AshleyReyes1	I had my first orgasm when I was 5 years old and taught my friend how to do it
4057	September 16th	12:37:10 PM	mahoonie    	Wow
4058	September 16th	12:37:42 PM	mahoonie    	That’s super young
4059	September 16th	12:38:16 PM	mahoonie    	You’re definitely off my top 10 list ;P
4060	September 16th	12:39:27 PM	mahoonie    	Kidding for some reason I like you even more, it’s like you’re born for that
4061	September 16th	12:39:36 PM	mahoonie    	I thought I started young
4062	September 16th	12:39:45 PM	mahoonie    	At 10 or something
4063	September 16th	12:40:17 PM	mahoonie    	I didn’t even have cum, it was so much fun, no consequences
4064	September 16th	12:44:34 PM	AshleyReyes1	yes hahahah

4089	September 17th	8:44:58 AM	mahoonie    	Are you confusing me with someone else?

4215	September 17th	10:34:11 AM	AshleyReyes1	I know
4216	September 17th	10:34:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	and I knew that you would remind me of this
4217	September 17th	10:35:01 AM	mahoonie    	Why did you ask then?
4218	September 17th	10:35:12 AM	mahoonie    	Bad memory
4219	September 17th	10:35:18 AM	AshleyReyes1	to keep the conversation going
4220	September 17th	10:36:07 AM	mahoonie    	Oh thank you
4221	September 17th	10:36:28 AM	mahoonie    	So what’s your favorite food?
4222	September 17th	10:36:54 AM	AshleyReyes1	I like almost everything
4223	September 17th	10:37:05 AM	AshleyReyes1	all that is delicious
4224	September 17th	10:38:00 AM	mahoonie    	You’re vegan so it’s not like you have many options :)
4225	September 17th	10:38:43 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahhahahha
4226	September 17th	10:39:07 AM	AshleyReyes1	you have no idea how varied vegan cuisine is
4227	September 17th	10:39:18 AM	mahoonie    	I do
4228	September 17th	10:39:25 AM	mahoonie    	My sister is vegan
4229	September 17th	10:39:38 AM	AshleyReyes1	recipes are not entirely simple, but everything is varied and tasty
4230	September 17th	10:40:04 AM	AshleyReyes1	did you say that to keep the conversation going back then? hahahah
4231	September 17th	10:40:13 AM	mahoonie    	I don’t know if you know but Argentinians are very passionate about meat
4232	September 17th	10:40:18 AM	mahoonie    	Haha no
4233	September 17th	10:40:24 AM	mahoonie    	Just to tease you
4234	September 17th	10:41:05 AM	AshleyReyes1	i know anyone who finds out i'm vegan starts talking about meat
4235	September 17th	10:41:31 AM	mahoonie    	Wait but I have a point
4236	September 17th	10:42:01 AM	mahoonie    	So when my sister told my dad that she is vegan it was like coming out of the closet
4237	September 17th	10:42:09 AM	mahoonie    	He was so sad
4238	September 17th	10:42:32 AM	AshleyReyes1	this is a very strange reaction
4239	September 17th	10:42:46 AM	AshleyReyes1	at least uncivilized
4240	September 17th	10:43:08 AM	mahoonie    	I told you it’s a very important part of the culture there
4241	September 17th	10:43:27 AM	AshleyReyes1	hate it
4242	September 17th	10:43:40 AM	mahoonie    	I know it’s not moral, but not everyone is an angel like you
4243	September 17th	10:44:12 AM	mahoonie    	I’m waiting for the technology to allow us to print meat
4244	September 17th	10:44:16 AM	AshleyReyes1	you don't need to be an angel to live in the 21st century
4245	September 17th	10:44:24 AM	AshleyReyes1	wow
4246	September 17th	10:44:28 AM	mahoonie    	I think we are close
4247	September 17th	10:44:46 AM	AshleyReyes1	but this already exists like
4248	September 17th	10:45:32 AM	mahoonie    	Yeah but now it costs like 1000$ for a burger
4249	September 17th	10:45:40 AM	mahoonie    	Nobody will pay that
4250	September 17th	10:46:45 AM	AshleyReyes1	I will not even talk about meat substitutes and other cool and tasty things, it's useless now
4251	September 17th	10:47:09 AM	mahoonie    	Why is it useless?
4252	September 17th	10:48:13 AM	AshleyReyes1	I do not like to continue to discuss this topic further, when at the beginning of the conversation my opponent spoke about the need for meat in life
4253	September 17th	10:48:35 AM	AshleyReyes1	more precisely, I see no reason to develop this topic
4254	September 17th	10:49:53 AM	mahoonie    	Ok
4255	September 17th	10:51:37 AM	mahoonie    	I am not your opponent, though I do like to wrestle you
4256	September 17th	11:08:05 AM	AshleyReyes1	for me it means just an interlocutor
4257	September 17th	11:09:02 AM	mahoonie    	Such complicated words 8)
4258	September 17th	11:09:12 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahahah
4259	September 17th	11:13:37 AM	mahoonie    	Do you want to tell me about your tattoos?
4260	September 17th	11:21:06 AM	AshleyReyes1	what can you tell about them?
4261	September 17th	11:21:24 AM	mahoonie    	How many do you have?
4262	September 17th	11:21:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	I also don't know what to tell about them heheh
4263	September 17th	11:21:33 AM	AshleyReyes1	5
4264	September 17th	11:21:48 AM	mahoonie    	I think I see 3 right?
4265	September 17th	11:22:09 AM	AshleyReyes1	no, 5 is on my hands
4266	September 17th	11:22:21 AM	AshleyReyes1	it looks like one piece
4267	September 17th	11:22:37 AM	mahoonie    	You don’t have any anywhere else?
4268	September 17th	11:22:57 AM	AshleyReyes1	no
4269	September 17th	11:23:15 AM	mahoonie    	I see you have nails on your right hand
4270	September 17th	11:23:31 AM	mahoonie    	Because you like makeup and such?
4271	September 17th	11:24:13 AM	AshleyReyes1	no :)
4272	September 17th	11:24:26 AM	mahoonie    	What is it then?
4273	September 17th	11:24:51 AM	AshleyReyes1	I do not understand the question
4274	September 17th	11:25:08 AM	mahoonie    	The hands with nails on your right hand
4275	September 17th	11:25:24 AM	AshleyReyes1	it's just a picture
4276	September 17th	11:25:45 AM	mahoonie    	It doesn’t mean anything? Or you don’t want to say?
4277	September 17th	11:26:38 AM	AshleyReyes1	not a single tattoo on me means anything
4278	September 17th	11:27:00 AM	mahoonie    	Really you just like the picture?
4279	September 17th	11:27:08 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
4280	September 17th	11:27:17 AM	AshleyReyes1	this is strange?
4281	September 17th	11:27:25 AM	mahoonie    	No
4282	September 17th	11:28:16 AM	mahoonie    	Mine is a lion because I’m Leo and I did it after my grandpa dies and his name is “Leon”
4283	September 17th	11:28:37 AM	AshleyReyes1	interesting
4284	September 17th	11:28:45 AM	mahoonie    	I thought you had some story too
4285	September 17th	11:28:51 AM	AshleyReyes1	no
4286	September 17th	11:29:33 AM	mahoonie    	And is that the moon on top of the hands tattoo? Or a nail?
4287	September 17th	11:29:52 AM	AshleyReyes1	moon
4288	September 17th	11:30:40 AM	mahoonie    	So is that like a ware wolf that gets like big nails when the moon is small?
4289	September 17th	11:31:00 AM	AshleyReyes1	haahah whaaat
4290	September 17th	11:31:20 AM	AshleyReyes1	I'm not sure that I translated it correctly
4291	September 17th	11:31:35 AM	mahoonie    	Like in the movies, where a person turns to a wolf in a full moon
4292	September 17th	11:32:00 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
4293	September 17th	11:32:21 AM	mahoonie    	Except for you the day of the month is the beginning of the moon
4294	September 17th	11:32:37 AM	mahoonie    	Actually that’s the end of the moon
4295	September 17th	11:33:07 AM	AshleyReyes1	my tattoo was parsed
4296	September 17th	11:33:22 AM	AshleyReyes1	no
4297	September 17th	11:33:31 AM	AshleyReyes1	it's new moon
4298	September 17th	11:33:46 AM	mahoonie    	Nope
4299	September 17th	11:33:54 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
4300	September 17th	11:34:05 AM	mahoonie    	Unless you’re in the south part of the earth
4301	September 17th	11:34:55 AM	AshleyReyes1	it's difficult for me, but I know for sure that there is a new moon on my hand
4302	September 17th	11:40:15 AM	mahoonie    	How are you so sure?
4303	September 17th	11:40:45 AM	AshleyReyes1	I know
4304	September 17th	11:41:19 AM	mahoonie    	I know too, I studied that 8) in the military
4305	September 17th	12:03:54 PM	AshleyReyes1	wow
4306	September 17th	12:20:50 PM	mahoonie    	Yeah, I can tell you about it when you’re not busy
4307	September 17th	12:21:48 PM	AshleyReyes1	then tell me now
4308	September 17th	12:24:02 PM	mahoonie    	Well first they taught us that a new moon faces right and an old moon faces left :)
4309	September 17th	12:24:11 PM	mahoonie    	What do you want to know?
4310	September 17th	12:25:59 PM	AshleyReyes1	I was taught wrong
4311	September 17th	12:26:05 PM	AshleyReyes1	or you
4312	September 17th	12:26:36 PM	AshleyReyes1	I don't know, you wanted to tell me something
4313	September 17th	12:26:46 PM	AshleyReyes1	probably about the moon
4314	September 17th	12:26:49 PM	AshleyReyes1	B)

5883	October 9th	8:24:10 AM	mahoonie    	Well for one you apparently can’t get started while you’re working here... you didn’t hear it from me, but I think that if you’ll stay in touch after the next 3 interviews the job is yours

6017	October 9th	10:52:06 AM	AshleyReyes1	no longer
6018	October 9th	10:52:15 AM	mahoonie    	That was quick
6019	October 9th	10:53:07 AM	AshleyReyes1	what exactly?
6020	October 9th	10:53:55 AM	mahoonie    	You can just turn from horny to not horny just like that?
6021	October 9th	10:54:12 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
6022	October 9th	10:54:26 AM	AshleyReyes1	I can control it
6023	October 9th	10:56:11 AM	mahoonie    	If we do another session, can you go after to finish yourself?
6024	October 9th	10:56:59 AM	AshleyReyes1	how's that?
6025	October 9th	11:01:11 AM	mahoonie    	It will be easier for me to finish if I know you'll also finish afterwards
6026	October 9th	11:03:40 AM	AshleyReyes1	Aah, you just want to know that I will touch myself after our private session? maybe on this bed? B)
6027	October 9th	11:04:09 AM	mahoonie    	Not necessarily on this bed
6028	October 9th	11:04:19 AM	mahoonie    	I just don't want it to be one sided
6029	October 9th	11:04:29 AM	mahoonie    	I want equality
6030	October 9th	11:04:38 AM	mahoonie    	It's very important to our company
6031	October 9th	11:05:05 AM	AshleyReyes1	I understand, I will do this after I leave this site
6032	October 9th	11:05:15 AM	AshleyReyes1	I can assure you of that
6033	October 9th	11:05:26 AM	AshleyReyes1	I take work home
6034	October 9th	11:05:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	sometimes
6035	October 9th	11:05:35 AM	mahoonie    	Will you think of me?
6036	October 9th	11:06:56 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
6037	October 9th	11:09:24 AM	mahoonie    	That makes me very happy
6038	October 9th	11:09:58 AM	AshleyReyes1	I'm happy if you're happy. Corny but true
6039	October 9th	11:10:40 AM	mahoonie    	I'm happy if you're happy
6040	October 9th	11:10:51 AM	mahoonie    	I guess that makes us just happy all the time
6041	October 9th	11:12:00 AM	AshleyReyes1	hhahhaah yhes
6042	October 9th	11:13:36 AM	mahoonie    	I can't believe I might only see you once more
6043	October 9th	11:14:03 AM	mahoonie    	Then I'll just be sad all the time, and then you'll be sad
6044	October 9th	11:23:54 AM	AshleyReyes1	Yes, based on our logic
6045	October 9th	11:41:01 AM	mahoonie    	If we met somewhere else instead of here, would you keep in touch with me
6046	October 9th	11:41:02 AM	mahoonie    	?
6047	October 9th	11:41:40 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes...
6048	October 9th	11:42:02 AM	AshleyReyes1	so I curse this site, I didn't want to get attached to anyone here
6049	October 9th	11:43:00 AM	mahoonie    	Why is it so bad?
6050	October 9th	11:45:18 AM	AshleyReyes1	what
6051	October 9th	11:52:03 AM	mahoonie    	Without this site we wouldn't have met
6052	October 9th	11:55:13 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes
6053	October 9th	11:55:37 AM	AshleyReyes1	therefore we are hostages of circumstances
6054	October 9th	12:01:04 PM	mahoonie    	Well if you ever miss me you know how to find me
6055	October 9th	12:01:12 PM	mahoonie    	So are you planning a vacation?
6056	October 9th	12:03:15 PM	AshleyReyes1	no, I do not know what to think of for this purpose already hahahahh
6057	October 9th	12:03:36 PM	AshleyReyes1	but in terms of my leaving here, yes, I will have a vacation
6058	October 9th	12:04:53 PM	mahoonie    	You wrote you need 250tk for vacation
6059	October 9th	12:06:00 PM	AshleyReyes1	yes, because you need to write something here
6060	October 9th	12:06:48 PM	mahoonie    	You didn't really tell me about your plans for the weekend

6290	October 16th	8:42:29 AM	mahoonie    	This will require a lot of coordination
6291	October 16th	8:42:54 AM	mahoonie    	But for you I’ll do that standing on my head even
6292	October 16th	8:44:04 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahhahah
6293	October 16th	8:44:22 AM	AshleyReyes1	it's interesting, but we won't try it
6294	October 16th	8:59:43 AM	mahoonie    	How is the game development going?
6295	October 16th	9:00:40 AM	AshleyReyes1	so far, nothing, I decided that I will go to the courses of creating websites lol
6296	October 16th	9:00:44 AM	AshleyReyes1	php... hahahha
6297	October 16th	9:01:01 AM	mahoonie    	Nooooo!
6298	October 16th	9:01:17 AM	mahoonie    	Php is the worst!
6299	October 16th	9:01:26 AM	AshleyReyes1	I know...
6300	October 16th	9:01:40 AM	AshleyReyes1	this is the best way to start learning programming
6301	October 16th	9:01:52 AM	AshleyReyes1	this is the best way to start learning programming
6302	October 16th	9:03:15 AM	mahoonie    	Saying it twice doesn’t make it right
6303	October 16th	9:03:28 AM	AshleyReyes1	sorry
6304	October 16th	9:03:28 AM	mahoonie    	Python is the best way, I promise
6305	October 16th	9:03:29 AM	AshleyReyes1	ahhahaahaha
6306	October 16th	9:03:45 AM	mahoonie    	It’s basically English
6307	October 16th	9:03:55 AM	AshleyReyes1	I wanted to say that I need to start learning programming from scratch
6308	October 16th	9:03:56 AM	mahoonie    	And no big words
6309	October 16th	9:04:17 AM	mahoonie    	But you like big words, so sorry
6310	October 16th	9:04:21 AM	AshleyReyes1	I understand, but you need to start with the simplest
6311	October 16th	9:04:27 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahahahah
6312	October 16th	9:04:46 AM	mahoonie    	This is the simplest
6313	October 16th	9:05:32 AM	AshleyReyes1	so I want to be a website developer, starting from the beginning, what courses should I study? I thought  php
6314	October 16th	9:05:52 AM	AshleyReyes1	you're trying to talk me out of it and now I'm confused
6315	October 16th	9:06:51 AM	mahoonie    	Just learn python
6316	October 16th	9:07:02 AM	mahoonie    	Php is really much worse
6317	October 16th	9:07:30 AM	AshleyReyes1	if you promise that Python is easier than PHP, but I know it's not
6318	October 16th	9:07:40 AM	mahoonie    	And if you’ll learn python we could just talk python to each other , no language barrier
6319	October 16th	9:07:53 AM	AshleyReyes1	lol
6320	October 16th	9:08:26 AM	mahoonie    	How do you know it’s not?
6321	October 16th	9:09:03 AM	AshleyReyes1	because they say that php is for the stupid
6322	October 16th	9:09:06 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
6323	October 16th	9:09:17 AM	AshleyReyes1	so I chose this
6324	October 16th	9:09:26 AM	mahoonie    	Because only a stupid person would choose it
6325	October 16th	9:09:47 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahaah
6326	October 16th	9:10:01 AM	AshleyReyes1	the circle is complete. it's funny, but I'm right
6327	October 16th	9:11:06 AM	mahoonie    	Please trust the guy that got a job at Apple
6328	October 16th	9:11:37 AM	AshleyReyes1	you have to consider that I don't know a damn thing about it
6329	October 16th	9:11:50 AM	AshleyReyes1	and that I need to start with the simplest
6330	October 16th	9:12:05 AM	AshleyReyes1	I believe you and I want to be a cool guy too hahah
6331	October 16th	9:12:15 AM	mahoonie    	It is the simplest, I promise
6332	October 16th	9:12:27 AM	mahoonie    	And please don’t be a guy
6333	October 16th	9:12:41 AM	mahoonie    	I really like you as a girl
6334	October 16th	9:13:18 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahahah
6335	October 16th	9:13:40 AM	AshleyReyes1	okay, Python so Python
6336	October 16th	9:13:59 AM	AshleyReyes1	thank you for your advice, the guy who works at Apple
6337	October 16th	9:15:10 AM	mahoonie    	Yes!
6338	October 16th	9:15:41 AM	mahoonie    	Now every time you write python you’ll think of me
6339	October 16th	9:15:51 AM	AshleyReyes1	you're promoting this language
6340	October 16th	9:15:58 AM	AshleyReyes1	yes hahaha
6341	October 16th	9:16:50 AM	mahoonie    	So do you know what website you want to build?
6342	October 16th	9:17:09 AM	AshleyReyes1	no, I want to study it
6343	October 16th	9:17:28 AM	AshleyReyes1	I choose between a web designer and just making websites
6344	October 16th	9:17:45 AM	mahoonie    	I think making websites pays more
6345	October 16th	9:18:04 AM	mahoonie    	But that’s not the only thing that is important
6346	October 16th	9:19:00 AM	AshleyReyes1	I want something that is simpler and more popular
6347	October 16th	9:20:03 AM	mahoonie    	Web design is like putting makeup on websites, so maybe you’ll like that more. But building websites pays a lot more
6348	October 16th	9:20:42 AM	AshleyReyes1	Yes, I like the first option much better :P
6349	October 16th	9:20:43 AM	AshleyReyes1	but
6350	October 16th	9:21:52 AM	mahoonie    	If money is a problem you can always come here and I’ll take care of you
6351	October 16th	9:22:01 AM	mahoonie    	We can build websites together
6352	October 16th	9:22:22 AM	AshleyReyes1	you are so sweet and kind to me
6353	October 16th	9:24:52 AM	mahoonie    	I have some time now if you want some sweet and kind time with me
6354	October 16th	9:25:21 AM	AshleyReyes1	hahahah
6355	October 16th	9:25:46 AM	AshleyReyes1	wait a bit, please, maybe it will be again only after my break
6356	October 16th	9:26:09 AM	mahoonie    	I have 40 minutes before my next meeting
6357	October 16th	9:26:22 AM	mahoonie    	And then the meeting is an hour

6360	October 16th	9:39:47 AM	AshleyReyes1	or now?
6361	October 16th	9:40:29 AM	mahoonie    	Nah, I don’t want to be right after big dick:)
