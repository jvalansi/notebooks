There is no computer that can smelt itself, because then it had to smelt itself as well
It just proves there is no God
For if God is what smelt all that is applicable and God is there then God smelt also himself, otherwise God is not
A kind of paradox
It can be solved if God is outside the universe

Can God create a stone that he cannot lift?
Does this not contradict the fact that God is omnipotent?
Maybe this is a problem with the word
It may be that this is simply not the definition of God, and that God is not omnipotent as we define omnipotent

Can God be above logic?
