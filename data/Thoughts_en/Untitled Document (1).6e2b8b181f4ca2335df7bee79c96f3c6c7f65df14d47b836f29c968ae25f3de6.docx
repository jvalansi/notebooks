Sheeran shouted at me
For saying I did not really wait for me she waited for me to take things out of the dishwasher
It was more like a joke
but it does not matter
Even if it was serious, it&#39;s still no reason to shout
Shouting is violence to me
There is never a reason for violence
Good
What else?
That&#39;s I left the house
And now I have to do everything with the cell phone
Maybe I should go back to the room I took
Maybe
Maybe we&#39;ll start with breakfast and coffee
But where to sit?
I&#39;m not that hungry
I&#39;m pretty thirsty
And I also prefer to eat with my coffee
But because of thirst I have no appetite so I do not so much know what I feel like
I have no power
I also need to resolve the question
And go through the emails
And I do not have an endless battery

Good
Sheeran apologized
That&#39;s not enough for me
I can not live with people shouting at me
How do I know this will not happen again?
She has promised in the past that it will not happen again
But it always happens again
so what are we doing?
Disassemble it?
Need some treatment
Or maybe a break, to see what the right thing to do
Maybe
I can ask the caregiver, let&#39;s see what she says
