Hey whats up
Everything is fine
Not too much
Saturday today
And the air outside is shit
So stay home
There is not too much to do
So get bored
If I could do anything
What would I do now?
Sex with Bar Refaeli
Or sex with Ashley
It seems to me that between the two I would have preferred with Ashley
Just because we have some kind of connection
So what in the end is it all sex?
Sex propels the world forward?
If you look at money, then the food industry is bigger isn&#39;t it?
Because by and large paying for sex is pretty taboo
Sex is supposed to be free
Although it&#39;s not really free
He needs some 3 dates
It&#39;s for the man
For this woman many times it ends in heartache
(Also for the man, but usually before sex)
So you can&#39;t put a price on it
Although it has a price
Basically it is measured in roses, a rose is $ 100, so a few hundred dollars
sort
Each date is about $ 100
Well depends on where
This is the first species
The cost of sex decreases over time
In an institutional relationship it is quite free
But at a wedding you are actually enslaving half of the income difference
When this difference can be quite large
But here too it is unreported money
But it&#39;s a lot of money
Does it contribute to the economy in any way?
How does the transfer of money contribute to the economy?
Because it is calculated in the product
Does the transfer of money from husband to wife indicate any product?
Do not think
As if a rational person would probably make this move only if it pays off for him, I would only answer if what he gets from the relationship is worth half the salary difference
Tachles is worth it only if there are children
Although the payment for children is different
This is a smaller percentage of the salary
The woman should receive 50% of the difference
Children it depends on the division of time, but in equal distribution still the percentage is lower
Children is a very long-term financial investment
And by and large today the children are no longer trusted for this support
There is a pension
So children is not an economic decision
And it seems that a woman does not either
Rationally people should just rent sex
That&#39;s illegal
I wonder if it was legal would it change that
There are countries where it is legal and people are still getting married
We may be wired to monogamy
So we find someone and only want him
It could be that women are monogamous and men are just trying not to hurt them
