What&#39;s up bro?
Walla Sabba
Long weekend
Pretty
And how you utilize it
Do nothing big
Also important
So what&#39;s going on?
Not too much
Yesterday I saw the series about Epstein
But mostly I was looking at a live porn site
This is a nice truth concept
You can have virtual sex with real women
It&#39;s porn porn
It&#39;s a little more human contact than just watching porn
It costs more
But it is not expensive
Suppose about $ 30
It&#39;s not sex
But now is Corona time, so there are not many options

I also worked on the project yesterday
I&#39;m a little stuck because of the upload to YouTube
I can meanwhile just create a page with all the videos in place
But this is not ideal
There are still issues, it does not work smoothly, even without uploading to YouTube
But I do not know whether to invest in it when I&#39;m stuck with YouTube

What else?
Next week I&#39;m at a conference
My first conference basically, but it&#39;s just online
Do not know how it will work
Hope it will be interesting

What else?
Do not know
politics?
This Epstein was linked
Really feels like there is another world above us
Although we did the calculation with Trump
Which is supposed to be a part of this world
If inflation is not taken into account, the 40 million he received should have been 70 times that today, which is 2.8 billion
Which is about what he has
This means that you can go from being a millionaire to a billionaire
But then why are not all millionaires billionaires?
There are 330 million people in the US
About 20 million millionaires
And about 500 billionaires
So basically one in 16 is a millionaire
And only one in tens of thousands of millionaires is a billionaire
This means that it is harder to get from a million to a billion than from nothing to a million






So ~ 10% (one in ten) reach a million
~ 1% (one in a hundred) reach ten million
Less than 0.1% (one in a thousand) reach one hundred million
600 out of 300 million which is ~ 1 per million reach per billion
40 (one in 15) over 10 billion
1,2 (one in 30) people over 100 billion




If in the whole world there are 2100 billionaires and in the USA 600, then we can assume that there is a ratio of 2 to 7 for the whole table
So the table will look like this:



So basically over 100 million has only 0.004% (4 per hundred thousand)
Over 30 million have 0.01% and not 0.1% as the second source claims
One can make an average between the two and say
That around 0.3% over 30 million

So so:

It is much harder to reach 100 million than 10 million
