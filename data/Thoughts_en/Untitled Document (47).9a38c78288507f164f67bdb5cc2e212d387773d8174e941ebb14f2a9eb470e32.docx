It bothers me that Sheeran is negative and that she is yelling at me

Now we were going to meet Matty
She did not want to take a bus and really did not want to take two buses
It bothers me more not to meet people at all
The mental injury here bothers me more
And whatever I suggested was done she said no
And it&#39;s hard for me
She&#39;s really scared of the corona
And I&#39;m not that scared
I obey instructions
For me to meet other people is necessary for my mental sanity
