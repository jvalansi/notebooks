Sentence:
Under a sheet with blocked derivatives function with a number of minimums, when the number of steps tends to infinity, convergence (maybe in the span maybe not?) To the global minimum

This step is derived or minus the derivative (with a probability of 50 percent)
When the step length is the maximum between changes of direction
(This change is a derivative that is magical)

This step is derived or minus the derivative (with a probability of 50 percent)
When the step length is the maximum between changes of direction (change of direction seems to me to be the distance between a minimum and a nearby local maximum)
That sounds right doesn&#39;t it?


I want to check if this is true and not stupid
It may extend the ability to do Gradient Descent to non-convex functions as well

This integral is average
g(x) = (f(x)-f(x+h))/h
f(x) = g(x)*h+f(x+h)=g(x)*h+g(x+h)*h+f(x+2h)=

(x ^ 2- (x + h) ^ 2) / h = -2x-h

x^2=-2xh-h^2-2(x+h)h-h^2+(x+2h)^2
