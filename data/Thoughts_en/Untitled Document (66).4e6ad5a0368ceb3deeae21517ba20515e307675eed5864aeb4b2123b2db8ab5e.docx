So I&#39;m here with people (Sheeran)
So I can not just sit and think


so what are we doing?
What about the startup?
Feel like working on it?
Walla sounds interesting doesn&#39;t it?
Please
There is a situation
It&#39;s quite a bit of work to start something from scratch
The question is whether I want to
It will not take less than five years now to see profits
And in five more years I can be free anyway

I can not be idle in front of a screen
I&#39;d rather see something already

Well then not a startup?
I know it&#39;s something to doâ€¦

Technically I can now write code
Instead of Hebrew
I do it sometimes
But only with a computer
What is the barrier to doing this on a cell phone?
How would I do that?
Opens the aws and opens a notebook
It&#39;s not much of a problem the price m maybe a little
That&#39;s a dollar an hour for a good machine
And it seems to me two cents per machine just, that it comes out fifty cents a day and then $ 15 a month, which is not terrible
I can also make a Google notebook that should be free
But it&#39;s not very friendly
then what?
Do not know the truth
I&#39;ll write code, maybe I&#39;ll affect the world
What do I care about influencing the world?

Once again Sheeran got mad at me for nothing
For interrupting her in the middle to say something unintentionally
So she says she got upset unintentionally
And even earlier she got upset
I do not remember what
But know she got upset

Feels he can&#39;t talk to her without getting upset
 
What was promoted?
What is
She&#39;s nervous now
I do not want to contain it

I feel ugly after seeing the video
How can I feel a million dollars and a second later ugly
How It Works?
