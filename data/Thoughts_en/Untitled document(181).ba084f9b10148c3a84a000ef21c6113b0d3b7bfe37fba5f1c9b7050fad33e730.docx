I need to find an investment property
I might be able to use some api
I need to add information of the increase in the value of the apartment
I need to communicate with agents
Best if I could get from realtor.com the information about median rent and median apartment price on all regions in America

To do the calculation I need
The price of the apartment - zillow
Rental price - zillow
Vacancy rate - factfinder
Expenses - factfinder
tax
Repairs
Insurance
Value increase - zillow
Talk to agents
Talk to the bank
