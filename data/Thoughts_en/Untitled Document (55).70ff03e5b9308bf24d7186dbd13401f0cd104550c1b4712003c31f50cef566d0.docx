It bothers me that she got mad at me for wanting to tell my parents that her parents are coming, because that&#39;s not happening
And now all of a sudden she says processes are starting
Stresses me that they will move
It will be much harder to come back
It bothers me that her family is more important to her than I am
Not that I think it&#39;s rare for the woman to be more connected to the family, as most men are cocky, and parental love is unconditional.
But it&#39;s still stressful that until I got rid of my family&#39;s stress, I had to deal with a family not mine
And the truth is I did not die for her father nor for her brother
I brought my brother ten thousand dollars which I probably will not see
Dad had a similar story too, he brought in a partner, and lost him full of money that your brother could not return
A friend of his arranged a job for him, and he sued him for compensation for an injury he would have been guilty of
They are also not that nice to me it feels
I can not trust her when she tells me there will be no problem coming back
The truth is I do not know if I can trust them
