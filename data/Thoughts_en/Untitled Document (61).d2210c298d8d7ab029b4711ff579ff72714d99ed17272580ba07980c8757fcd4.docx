Good
So we&#39;re here and it&#39;s already clear
so what are we doing
I can drive home to get luggage
I can ask for luggage from the store
Good
so what are we doing
How long is it for the cell?
an hour and a quarter
From the parents it is an hour and a half
what is the plan?
Economic analysis
What else?
a question
Good
So I charge the device
What now?
Why do you always need something now?
Why not just anything…
I do not know if I&#39;m still hungry or not
Maybe I should have traveled with the destination
I just preferred not to
I wanted an hour to myself
Not a social hour
But it does not give too much
What am I already doing at this time?
What else to do…
Good question
If I had all the money
what am I doing?
I have no idea
Don&#39;t know if I&#39;m even resigning
The options is what I wrote down
Or just swimming with the current
Or make music with computational learning
or
