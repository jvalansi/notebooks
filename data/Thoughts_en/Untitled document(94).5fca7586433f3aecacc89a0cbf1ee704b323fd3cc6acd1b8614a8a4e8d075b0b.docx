Ok

The results from the tf experiment look promising.
What’s the next step?
I need to predict on real world data.
Try trading for a few weeks with this system, see how well it’s doing.
Let’s say we do this for a month or 2.
If everything goes well we can start trading for real.

What about syndications?
That too.
I need to analyze ±20 deals before committing to one.
Ok,
If I get 20% I’m great!
