Peace
I feel stuck
I&#39;m not progressing in anything for the full time

Maybe if I use its issue track for my life
Why is it not as user friendly as this app?
You can use Git Love
But I do not know how neat it is

I would like to arrange what I write by topics
To be more orderly
I would like a tree of knowledge from what I write,
How does it help?
Do not know, but otherwise why write
Write because it&#39;s easier to talk to myself like that
When it passes in the real world

What a terrible headache I had yesterday
Jesse a heat stroke to the face
I do not know how it is valid so strongly
And why so long after I was in the sun

The problem with web applications is that it is not possible to work offline
Technically I can broadcast from my cell phone, but it would be good if there was an option for offline use

I want a million dollars
Even three quarters is enough for me
I need a profit of a dollar on a million products
Or a profit of a thousand dollars on a thousand products
I want to do a simulation of reality
From statistics to build a model of reality
I want to play with it, like civilization
I want to build software that is like Fractal
Each object is the object from which it inherits with the same change
Human society is a fractal
Every public is in the image of a person
Every public has needs, feelings, ideas
I want to make software that simulates the genetic tree
Each creature inherits from the previous one with a mutation
We&#39;re just talking monkeys
It allows us to work together
This is why a group of 5 is stronger than just about any animal
That&#39;s why we&#39;re at the top of the food chain
Even a monkey can use a stick to hunt
But alone he will have a hard time
Actually I do not know
Yes because one stick is not enough to kill an animal
And he can only run with one stick
But five people
Maybe one that carries and four more shots
It&#39;s much harder to stop
Monkeys are talking
It&#39;s crazy
