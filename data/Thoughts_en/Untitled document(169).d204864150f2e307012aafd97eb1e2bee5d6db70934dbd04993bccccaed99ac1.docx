So what do I do?
what are the options?
Work on computational learning
In the field of money
In the field of language
Work with the census

What do I want to do?
If I did not have to do anything, what would I do?
Do not know

What interests me about the census?
I would like to do a simulation of the world through the statistics
Maybe try to predict the future that way
Maybe turn it into a game
Maybe try to figure out what actions are worth doing
