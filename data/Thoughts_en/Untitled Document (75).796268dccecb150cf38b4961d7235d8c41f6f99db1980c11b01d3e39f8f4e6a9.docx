Ok
So what now?
I can keep working on the deep money 
Is it still interesting to me?
I believe it is
Any other way to make money?
What about an nlp application?
Well, the news sentiment is nlp but doesn’t currently work 
I can try to replicate the guys stock prediction work…
That looks pretty promising…
But it’s not really nlp, or is it? There may have been some news features, might be a good way to improve upon it
Another thing would just think of some nlp application I can work on, that I could someday create a business out off.
But what application?
How would I benefit from having an nlp application?
What pain point I have that can be solved by using some nlp?
What are my pain points?
Mainly the fact I need to work,
Also that I can’t fuck whoever I want…
Maybe politics is a pain point?
I mean it’s not really disturbing me that much, but some of my time and energy goes to that…
What about creating that super intelligent being?
I could work on that…
The pain point is death
And having a machine that is super intelligent might help.
One way is to get it to think of a way to avoid death.
Though I have an idea.
I want to upload my brain to the cloud.
The problem here is hardware.
I need a way to communicate with my neurons one by one…
Can a machine help improve the hardware?
A physical machine maybe, but probably not a virtual one.
First step might be to augment the brain.
Connect something to it that extends my cognition.
We can already somewhat enhance our cognition, for example by adding sensors to the skin, but this is a one way communication.
We can’t tell anything to the sensors. What happens if we do the same with neurons?
I don’t think there’s currently a way to activate single neurons.
I wonder if that’s important, what if we activate a large number of neurons?
What is the level of activation we can achieve today?
If I want a 2 way communication without touching any neurons, that by using muscles. What are some disposable muscles in the body?
I can use the pinky for example.
So what about a machine that helps me play chess by using the pinky?
What is the resolution of thought? I probably have tons of neurons going to and from my pinky. If I use them to communicate to a neural network, what happens?
