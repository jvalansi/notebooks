In short, &quot;what to do&quot; is a question
I&#39;m pissed at the agent who just cut me
I can either go for it with another agent
Or look for another realtor

On the one hand, he deserves compensation for all the time he spent with me
I can send him some gift card or something

Oops it&#39;s holding me back in about a month or two

so what to do?
I need to take care of the open tabs
Treat those that have become bookmarks
I have a lot of other things in Asana
I do not even know if to continue using it
And I did not even talk about the work I still have to do
But it&#39;s not for now
Or so
I did not read from the reading list
I always give it up
There are more things I want to read than I pay to read

What a mess
There are two things that interest me
Of money
And computational learning

So what else do I have to do?
Miles?
