So we&#39;re here and it&#39;s already clear
But what do you do from here?
What do you do from there?
Who are the people who put this in writing
Who are the people who take this off the record
Why would they do that
where are we going?
Where are we not going?
And where do we come from?
From the belly of history
And get her out of the glass
What is the appropriate word?
And a garden?
Every moment is a birth
Every moment is death
All the moments and none of them
Who are the people who do not think that way
Who are the people?
What it means
What is
what
