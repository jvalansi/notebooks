So my brain is hard wired for curiosity…
Which makes sense because you need exploration to maybe find a better resource.
So it’s not wrong to choose the red pill.

Where else would sellaism contradict anything I believe?

So we all just want to be happy…

Well I think happiness is a lie.
It’s not really measurable. And is super evasive.
Like a butterfly in your hand.
If you try to see it it’s no longer in your hand.
But then what is flow?
What is the physiology of flow?
It’s all not fully understood. But I know I felt it at some point .
Maybe focusing on happiness can move it further away.
