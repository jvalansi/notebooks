so what are we doing???
Walla does not know Ya in Dalek
So that&#39;s a problem
Why do I want to play this game?
It&#39;s not too complicated
The animation is appealing
competitive
Can I make such a game out of my life?
Where do I want to go?
To the State of the Art Bot


How do I make it a game?
Need small and uncomplicated parts
Need some animation
Need to be competitive - I think language is not so lacking


It&#39;s not a problem to open a project in some task app
And turn it into a game
Each task is broken down into small and uncomplicated tasks
And the competition is to complete all tasks
Not here but so animated
Don&#39;t know if this is really critical
Big enough Excel page
I may be able to control the graphics with the app that turns sheets into apps

Asana turned
I would add points
For example, according to the number of hours something takes
Suppose the goal is to reach 10,000 hours
And every hour is a point
But asana does not have a field of how long it takes

I can pay $ 10 a month to have custom reports and fields
Or I can build some system
$ 10 a month is something like a $ 1,000, $ 2,000 investment
Which is something like two days to a week of work
I do not know if I can build something like this in a week, but it might also be interesting to do it
I can try the Asana Premium and decide.
I can also just write the part of the report myself, and use Asana&#39;s api

Another question is what will I work on
By and large it was cool to work on a model of dialogue
But now I&#39;m supposed to deal with transliteration
I have no problem working on it but by and large it&#39;s quite ready, just missing to make it an integration to Sequoia and then to Morpon
So it&#39;s not exactly Machin Lerning
And I have nothing to work on in my free time
So what to work on in my free time?
dialogue?
What will benefit Siri?
By and large what else in Morphen can be statistical?
Everything
for example?
What&#39;s in Morphen?
Tokenization, transliteration, inflation,

Okay so Asana Premium costs $ 50 a month and has to be paid for a year
So I will probably give up…
What are the options?

Jira?
Asana not premium?
Something of mine?
Warrick?

So what the hell to do?
I do not know!
Another week without direction?
By and large I would be happy to work on transliteration…
But even there I deal in poop
Like there are more things to do, but only after I finish the poop…
On the one hand I do not want to work on poop at home,
On the other hand I do not want to work on something else at home, and prefer to concentrate on it

so what to do?
Just flow?
But if I flow, I just go to sleep
what will I do? meditation?
I would like it to be my hobby
Let&#39;s just come home and open my models…
But that&#39;s not the point right now
I hope to reach this stage as soon as possible
Then continue in directions that interest me

In the meantime I will do a Kegel course…
