What to do?
Working
project
sex
Of money

Do not know whether to sell the house
It&#39;s a lot of headache
I guess it calmed down over time
But really do not know
In the capital market I can make an average of 8%
But safely pull 6%
From real estate I think I do 12%
Which means I can probably pull 10%
Do not close on it
But this is a significant difference
Almost twice as much
That&#39;s to make 100,000 out of a million instead of 60,000
Good
What more?
How&#39;s work
Okay I think
But I feel like my manager has a problem with me a bit right now
Do not know
I think I&#39;m not fit for the job
They mostly need someone to do a platform, which means c ++, and I&#39;m really not versed
So it sucks a bit
It also does not interest me
Good
so what are we doing?
If it continues like this, I&#39;ll ask to move on
I can suggest doing a joint project with Sid&#39;s group for example
I can try to move to Ernie
I can try to move on to Peter
we will see what will be
Good
What else?
There&#39;s nothing new with Ashley
What to doâ€¦
I&#39;m going on
I was dying to tell her I was coming to Russia, if she wanted to meet
Oops
Now he has so little option
I would be happy if there was an option to send a private message
what can we do
What do I do with Sheeran?
What can I do?
I&#39;m making a financial agreement
Do not know if I will implement it
I do not want to hurt her
But also do not want to hurt myself
Maybe I really need a psychologist
I can free from work
we will see what will be
Good
What more?
Do not know
I also need someone to help me with money maybe
Good
What more?
Do not know
What more?
