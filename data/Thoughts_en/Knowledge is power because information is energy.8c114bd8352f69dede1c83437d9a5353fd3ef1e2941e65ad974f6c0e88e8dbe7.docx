Knowledge is power because information is energy

Information is a lack of entropy, which is precisely energy that can be realized
So knowledge is the realization of energy
As power is the realization of energy (the derivative of energy by place)

If one looks at history as a collection of coin tosses on one side good and one side bad
So in essence life is fair

How can there be more irrational but between every two there is rational



Suppose there were only 10 digits
That is, in binary the highest number was 1111111111
Suppose we look only at the first 5 digits
1111100000 and 1111100010 are the same for us
What is the chance that we have fallen for a number that has not been repeated in the last 4 digits
The options for repetition are
0000
1111
0011
1100
0101
1010
All arrangement options are 2 at 4:16
That is, the ratio is about a third between &quot;rational&quot; and &quot;irrational&quot;
Each n digits has 2 in n options, and sequences of 1 to n / 2 (must be repeated at least twice)
That is, we have 2 in i options when i between 1 and n / 2 is an engineering series whose sum
2^(n/2+1)-1/(2^1-1) ~= 2^(n/2+1)
The difference between the sums is about 2 in n
The ratio of the sums is about 2 in n / 2
When n / 2 is the same order of magnitude as n

The world is really divided by continents:
Europe, North America, Australia (South America) - Western culture (Latin subculture in South America)
Africa - Blacks
India - Indians
Asia - Chinese (there is also Russia which is half Asia half Europe)
Middle East - Arabs and Jews
