It seems to me it has to do with dbquery
But it&#39;s more than that
It&#39;s turning text into a graph
for example:

My dog also likes eating sausage.
turn into:
nmod:poss(dog-2, My-1)
nsubj(likes-4, dog-2)
advmod(likes-4, also-3)
root(ROOT-0, likes-4)
xcomp(likes-4, eating-5)
dobj(eating-5, sausage-6)

Dog

Likes:

Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers felt like an autobiography
