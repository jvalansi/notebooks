Hey
what&#39;s going on?
All is well
What about you?
Sabba
What are you telling?
Not too much
Had the Apple event, they did not announce a new iPhone
Will probably announce later this year
I was with Ashley all morning
She&#39;s probably not from Russia
Probably something near
Maybe one of the stans
Maybe Eastern Europe
Was nice but now i have egg pain
I hope she has too
I&#39;m trying too hard for her
Probably after sex I got off
Although we kind of had sex
Do not know
And now she does not want to do it anymore
She feels bad about it
Like a whore or something
Too bad
As if for me there is not so much a problem with prostitution
But women have a problem
It&#39;s something in culture I guess
I&#39;m ashamed I didn &#39;t see her tit
And that I did not take advantage of it anymore that she did it
I&#39;m fine
With only to bring in hand in front of her
She loves it it seems to me
Maybe she&#39;s just flirting with me
But I think I have a good radar for good people
And she looks like a good guy
It seems to me that I would give up Sheeran for her
It does not seem so logical now
But maybe if she leaves me a way to contact her I can somehow send her money or maybe fly to her
I do not know how I will fly to her
Because of the plague
If there had not been an epidemic I might have said it was for a conference
Good
Another vision for the date
See if you&#39;ll leave me a way to contact her at all

I spoke with Sheeran yesterday about the financial agreement
She seems to be more open to it now
She claims she sacrificed her career for me
It&#39;s a little annoying
I did not ask you to sacrifice for me
The opposite if I remember correctly I asked her a thousand times if she&#39;s sure it&#39;s okay and I do not want her to blame me for anything if we do
But Sabba is the sacrifice
How much is this sacrifice worth
According to the calculation I made, it is around 200,000
Should it just fall on me or split between us?
I think it&#39;s not my fault
But a spin letâ€™s say we split
It&#39;s 100,000
I have no problem putting 200,000 in a joint account
And continue with us our division that we both put aside half for both of us and the rest of each
I think the fair distribution is a quarter
A quarter of income and a quarter of capital
At most
Why
A quarter of the income is what she gets now
That&#39;s what we live for
A quarter of the capital, because let&#39;s say I&#39;m retiring
If she receives half of the capital, she actually receives half of my income and above that another quarter of the income is already 75%
It&#39;s not fair
So a quarter of the capital is a quarter of the income and in addition a quarter of the income is exactly half
Except that if she earns half of what I earn it will be the division anyway
It&#39;s shorter
Good
What else?
Sabba
I feel pretty good about the way I run this event
we will see what will be
Beauty
What about work
Work fine
It seems to me I have reached a milestone in two of the things I need to do
Tomorrow I need to talk to the Japanese guy to see if he can provide me with a list of names
Will shorten processes for me
