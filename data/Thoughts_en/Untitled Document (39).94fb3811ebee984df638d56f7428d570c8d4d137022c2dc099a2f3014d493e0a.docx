Hi what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
Sheeran got mad at me for imitating her
Do not understand why
She keeps mimicking me
She told me not to talk to me until she apologized
This is a bit excessive
Do not know where it comes from
She was offended
I did not mean to offend
But it is impossible so that it is impossible to laugh at each other
This is a bit excessive in my opinion

Still a divorce
I got up at a quarter to eight that it was a turn
I went to bed pretty late
But even before that I fell asleep on the couch
There is a situation where I have slept enough
Do not know
Max I will take melatonin
Good
What else?
I&#39;m a little torn between these and Peter
Looks like a question does not want to give up on me
that make sense
She has all 4 people, and that too was taken from her
So you can understand
But I&#39;m pissed because I want to be a part of this project that seems really important to me
what can we do
Peter has already handed over the responsibility to Melis
But it&#39;s up to me in my opinion
There&#39;s enough work for both of us
We&#39;ll see what these say

what else?
Not too much
Another day in isolation
Saturday today
Damn a bit that tomorrow I&#39;ll probably have to work
Because I prefer to work first
I must take time off
I&#39;ll take
After soaking is over I think I&#39;ll take some time off
What a week like that
I have to take a week every quarter in my opinion
To maintain sanity
Another 16 quarters with the help of the name I am a free person
With God&#39;s help
Where do we take the vacation?
Maybe Mexico?
Maybe
It&#39;s just a financial expense
And only now have we had a big expense
And Sheeran is not working
Even a TV I can not buy
Why is TV so important to me?
I do not like the cables there
And the fact that it stands out
And that she is small
And you need an iPad to see something in it
And every time you have to bring the iPad and return it
But I know that once we buy a TV Sheeran will not forget it for me
That we buy things we do not need
But she bought Bruce for $ 180
What about it really?
Looks good this month
But she buys things
It&#39;s not that she does not buy
Maybe thirty dollars a month
So once every six months I am allowed to buy something at 200
Or wait for Cyber Monday
In November
Good
Well what else?
Already 9, maybe I&#39;ll get up?
It&#39;s just one room, I can &#39;t get up without waking Sheeran
Good
So what&#39;s next?
What do you want to do today?
Maybe just do nothing
sounds like a plan
Good
What is it?
What about politics?
I am right and wrong in politics because it is a discussion of good and evil that is subjective
So how can one argue?
I think it&#39;s like a football team
No matter what the other side does it will not be okay
In the first wave the treatment was excellent but no one said well done
Now in the second wave everyone is complaining that Bibi is to blame
okay, well
What are you complaining about?
There is a closure
Who did nothing to prepare for the second wave
Released too quickly
But not a pity for anger?
It seems boring to people so they talk about politics
what can we do
Too bad to be angry
My health is more important than I can get from the argument
It&#39;s fun to win an argument
But I do not know if it is possible to win an argument over good and evil
Do not know if the government is doing a great job
But does not bother me enough
The main complaint about Bibi is that he is corrupt
But that is what the court needs to determine
Because he decides on the good and the bad in the country
So basically as long as it&#39;s legal it&#39;s fine
The means are kosher
There are also things that are illegal and are fine
And the law needs to be changed
So the way is to function
Choose someone who thinks like you and hope he will fight for you
You can demonstrate but do not know how much it helps
What would I like to achieve from politics?
What would I change?
Weed?
Peace with the Palestinians?
