I&#39;m currently writing here, and it&#39;s a mess
Quite easily I can use code to categorize the files or paragraphs into groups
But I can not do it from here because I can not write code on the iPad
This should not be a problem
I can do ssh to some machine and work there
But there should also be a way to do it through a browser
Eclipse Che is supposed to be ide for the browser but it is not mobile friendly
For this I need to study web development
Do not know if this is my priority right now

I would like to develop
