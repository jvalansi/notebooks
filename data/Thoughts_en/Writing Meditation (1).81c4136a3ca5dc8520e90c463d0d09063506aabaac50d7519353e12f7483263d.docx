Meditation in writing

So what do you think?
Not too much
What do I already have to think
I want a throne
To buy freedom
I need NIS 3 million
This means an order of magnitude of 1000-2000 shekels 1000-2000 times
This means that if a day I get 1000-2000 shekels I need 1000-2000 such, which is between 3-6 years, or if not calculated Friday and Saturday, then 5-10 years
Or I will just get 10,000 a month forever which means 300 shekels a day, or 500 shekels a day not including Saturday
how do I do it?
All in all, it will be enough for me to have an apartment that I rent, I need NIS 10,000 from the apartment, a two-room apartment in Dizengoff is worth about NIS 5,000 a month, and is worth about NIS 2 million, that means you need 2 for 10,000 a month, that means you need 4 million for it
So how do you get NIS 4 million?
10000 a month is 120 thousand a year, it&#39;s about 3 percent a year, it&#39;s not that much, only inflation 3 percent, but it&#39;s related to inflation, so basically it&#39;s 3 above inflation
There are better investments

I would like to develop an app, how much money is a user worth?
Facebook Yahoo and Likdain make about $ 1-2 per user per year, Google makes $ 10 per year
According to an estimate of a dollar per user, I need 120,000 shekels a year, which is 30,000 dollars, that means 30,000 users,
By an estimate of 10 cents I need 300 thousand

What do I want to do?
I want to play civilization
I want to build the game
What in total is in it
There is a board, which consists of squares, there are people and there are products that people can produce
Each slot has properties

Every product has characteristics
The properties can be listed on the fly
The properties should amount to
