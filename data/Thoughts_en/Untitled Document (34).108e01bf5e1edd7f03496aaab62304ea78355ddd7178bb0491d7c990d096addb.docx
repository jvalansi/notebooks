Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Can&#39;t get Hannah out of her head
I&#39;m thinking of bringing her
Pay her for a flight to Saint-Pierre
And meet with her
And it seems to me that she will agree

What&#39;s the point of suddenly keeping track of expenses
Enough already
Where do I have my own card?
I need to achieve something like this
Maybe Robin Hood?
Maybe not a trade
Maybe interactive brokers
Or just order once a month and that&#39;s it

Good
What else?
Everything is fine
I opened it with Sheeran
okay, well
I explained myself a turn

What else?
Walla
Not too much
I was thinking of working on the project
But not so know how
I thought from the iPad
But he&#39;s with Sheeran
If I work from the computer I&#39;m afraid they&#39;ll say it&#39;s Apple property
Not that I really think it will happen
But what are the options?
Maybe develop in the cloud
how?
It is possible in vim on the site
It&#39;s possible
I can do ssh from thermius to instance
