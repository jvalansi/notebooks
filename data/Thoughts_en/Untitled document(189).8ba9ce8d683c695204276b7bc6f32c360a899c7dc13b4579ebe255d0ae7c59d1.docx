My book will be read
Documents and thoughts
Thoughts and documents
Well then there is
What about a book?
About what he will be
A collection of my thoughts
Why would anyone care about my thoughts?
What do I care if someone cares?
I want to leave something
Or rather my thoughts want to stay

I want to analyze a language
How to analyze a language?
what&#39;s the point
I have the syntactic tree of the sentence
Did I understand the sentence?
Understand the sentence if you have the representation of the world it represents in your head

They show that: king-man = queen-woman
I wonder if a definition also works that way, for example
Dictionary = collection + words + annotations
It makes a bit of sense because it adds to all the sentences in which the word appeared in the collection the sentences in which the word words appeared and the collection of sentences with annotations
