What do I do with my life
I was dying to make the coast
She&#39;s stolen

What more
I want to go to Burning Man
But do not know if it will happen
Not pushing there in a hundred horsepower

I want my project to finally rise

That I may not have to work
Do what I want

Now suppose I do not have to go to work
what am I doing?
Traveling?
Makes electronic music?
politics?
Wikinews
This is amazing
Deep learning

This does not know what else

I play this catchy game every day
This is nonsense
I need to replace that in the game of the project

I am currently using gitlab
I can connect wrike or jira with gitlab or bitbucket

What more
what am I doing

I wasted yesterday on just an evening
I drank too much and had a headache all day
Just a waste of a day
