So what will I tell
There is not too much
Went for a walk at work
But what about life itself?
I wanted to see if a recession could be predicted, but it did not seem simple
I thought about why religion?
I do not know if I have an answer

What bothers you?
Not too much
Maybe I can only sleep with one woman?
And I&#39;m not closed on that either
Like, would be nice if I could, but do not know if it&#39;s the most critical
Go to work?
Maybe, maybe it&#39;s annoying

For the millionth time 170 income, 65 living, 65 savings, 40 tax
In total there should be more tax, it seems to me because it&#39;s just one income, so it is divided between the two of us

So now 230
Another year 230 + 65 + 23 = 320
Two more years + 65 + 32 = 420
More 3 + 65 + 42 = 525
Another 4 + 65 + 52 = 640
Another 5 + 65 + 64 = 770
More 6 + 65 + 77 = 920
Then half a year to retireâ€¦
With God&#39;s help

In the meantime trying to promote retirement, in total with 10% I should be able to retire another 4 (with 650 thousand)
But turn around, let there be 6 for safety
