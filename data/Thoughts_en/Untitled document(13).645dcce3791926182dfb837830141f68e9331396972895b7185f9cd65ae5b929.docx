Hey whats up?
Everything is fine
What about you?
Sabba
Had a nice day with Lisa
We laughed a little
I laughed at her
Such a cutie
At work, there is something I volunteered to do
That I&#39;m really pissed off about him
But I do not have too much to do with it
I still have a lot of things to do
I&#39;m still trying the investment strategy
Do not know what I was trying to achieve with the data I added
It does not really give too much
I already had a history of 20 years
That should be enough
Most companies do not hold more than that
Good
What else?
Do not know
I might need to take care of the taxes
I pay a lot of tax
This is something that if I save can really change
That&#39;s a third of the salary
If I earn another third it&#39;s great
That&#39;s another half of the truth
That&#39;s a lot
Yes it&#39;s next in line on the list I guess
I have to do the Beck Generation
I have no strength for it because it&#39;s boring
But should
So what about the investment strategy?
Do not know
Will we give up?
Do not know
what is the plan?
Do not know
Good
What else?
Do not know
Some of the things I do
acupuncture
Trying to get into Google
Learning chess
Besides the preference for couple therapy and a financial agreement
I also need to take care of the license
And in my teeth
It is not over
Take care of taxes
Invest in startups
All kinds of things related to money
All kinds of things related to learning
These are the two main things
I do not have time for everything
One project at a time
Now there are two truths, it&#39;s a prenuptial agreement and couple therapy
Your brother needs to take care of taxes
Maybe do some course
Annual expense analysis
Also important
And what about the investment strategy?
Give up?
The idea is to invest in what has historically maximized the safe pace of attraction
But there is no correlation between this and the increase in value
So I do not know if it is relevant…
That&#39;s a good idea for sure
An interesting idea
And surely there is also more to think about the way the calculation of the 5th percent
I need to check if it really fits the value of one-sixth of the returns
By and large I feel like one should just look at Sharp
And maybe maximize it
But it&#39;s starting to get complicated
Then I think the best is the simplest
If I minimize losses (to tax) I earn more than trying to maximize the return
And it&#39;s much easier and safer
So just learn about this generation Beck
If I put in another 15,000 a year, it&#39;s very nice
The truth is that it&#39;s not as much as I thought
Because even one percent raise in attraction is worth much more than that
But 15 thousand a year, double three years, 45 thousand, is good money
Actually I do not even know if it saves tax
There is a situation that it just earns without tax…
There is a situation
Okay
Well I&#39;ll read about it
Anyway the investment strategy is still interesting
But need to sleep
