So I had some nice ideas but it’s not getting feedback in reddit…

Equality prevents progress, imagine birds were not allowed to have wings because it’s an unfair advantage…

What’s fairness?

impartial and just treatment or behavior without favoritism or discrimination

Impartial - treating all rivals or disputants equally; fair and just.

Just - based on or behaving according to what is morally right and fair

Treatment - the manner in which someone behaves toward or deals with someone or something

Behavior - the way in which one acts or conducts oneself, especially toward others

Favoritism - the practice of giving unfair preferential treatment to one person or group at the expense of another.

Discrimination - 
the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex
recognition and understanding of the difference between one thing and another

Compound definition:
Equal behavior towards different categories

Is equality a positive thing?

Does society benefit from equality?
If you favor one on the benefit of the many, I guess not…
But for example, communism wasn’t good for the society, even though it’s based on equality…

What are we trying to maximize here?
The average happiness? (how are you from 1 to 10)

But there is a correlation between happiness and equality

Is happiness the most important thing?

What’s more important than happiness?
For example I won’t give up iq for happiness…
So is iq the most important?
Why? What does that give me?
Why is discovering patterns so important?
It helps predict the future, I might be happy now, but if I don’t predict the future I might not keep being happy…
I wouldn’t give up creativity for happiness
What is creativity?
The ability to come up with new ideas
So anyone who just come up with tons of stupid ideas is creative?
No, the ideas shouldn’t be stupid. 
What about a painter, he doesn’t really come with ideas.
So maybe it’s not just the creation of ideas, but any creation that is positive.
But positive is in the eye of the beholder…
So if there’s no crowd, is he still creative?
Well to measure his creativity, there has to be a beholder…
Can I measure my own creativity? I guess I can, but it’s probably more accurate the more people look at it…

So why is the ability to create more important to me than happiness?
Maybe because I enjoy it?
Maybe it’s part of my happiness, so I can’t be happy without creating?

Why isn’t happiness, the most important thing?

Maybe I want to create intelligent and important stuff, 
Why important?
I want to be important.
What’s important?
That has value.
How do you measure value?
Money?
I guess not only, a teacher creates tons of value, but is not getting paid much, well that’s probably because there are many people doing that…
A nobel prize discovery is super valuable, but moneywise it’s only worth 1M$.
Because people don’t do it for money, 
Why do they do it?
To be important?
Because it’s interesting to them? Probably…
What is interesting?
Something that increases curiosity.
What’s curiosity?
The will to understand.

What’s the conclusion?

So can value be measured by money

For example a nobel price can’t really be valued with money
Because it’s free for everyone to use, the paper is public.
So how do you measure the value of papers?

So equality is related to nobel laureates…
But is that the important measure?

So IQ is also (negatively) correlated to gini (more equality more iq)
But it could be related to the gdp per capita…

Being happy, is being satisfied, like being full, but I’d rather be hungry and eating then be full…

My favorite hunger is curiosity
