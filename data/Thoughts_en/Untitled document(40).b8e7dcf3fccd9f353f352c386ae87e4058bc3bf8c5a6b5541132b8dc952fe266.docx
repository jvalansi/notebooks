I what I have
I do hand in front of porn models
The truth that revolved
It could be worse
The question is can it be better?
But then I always chase after myself
Why not just settle for what is there
Once I have a million dollars
By and large this is it
I finished my debt to the company
then what?
What I want
As long as I do not spend more than 60 thousand a year or so
I can do it
The question is whether I want to spend more and how much is it worth to me

Good
What else?
Can&#39;t find the video
A video that a black girl says I&#39;m going to Saban Elban. Does anyone need anything?
But she says Saban Elban - Sam Elm
So you can connect it with Black Betty

Good
What else?
Everything is fine
Need to finish soon
But yes I realized that what I need to do is use the Lanning machine to develop chips for working with the brain
that&#39;s it
I can try to make it from Apple
But I can also try to do it myself
Or from another company
Good
What else?
Apologize to Tomer?
Yes why not when the opportunity arises
What about Ilan?
Yes I guess so too
Good

What else?
Do not know
What about you?
Everything is fine

A friend of Liad said that blacks and Mexicans study better because they have stopped dealing with the social, so they deal more with the study material.
So it&#39;s really someone who looks better, learns less
And women look better so they do not have to learn much
segment
Why are blacks and Hispanics more social?
Is it genetic?
The size of the bulbul?
More horny?
There is a situation
segment
Or maybe they just do not see what is happening to others
Then they do not compare themselves and get mad that they are not doing well
As with that gifted people who go to gifted school are less successful because they feel less equal relative to the population there
We are also more difficult with ourselves in failure than happy in success
It&#39;s a basa
That means it&#39;s harder to be happy
it&#39;s not fair
So on average we are not happy
