So nothing matters?
It&#39;s all a result of physics and biology and psychology and sociology
But does that mean nothing matters?

The conclusion comes from induction
We once thought that what matters is God
Or the king
Or the state
Or equality
Or freedom
And all were found to be arbitrary
moment
Are they arbitrary?

What does it mean to be important?
Meaning what value we give to talk
Can we just not give values to things?
This probably happens naturally
There are values that are quite ingrained in us
Like the importance of sex and food

There are social values
Are social values not important?
We can not ignore them completely
We can try to live on a lonely island
But as long as we do not, we must consider the values of others

Okay
So basically there are social values
Is a world without social values better?
A moment when there are no social values there is no meaning to better

Okay
