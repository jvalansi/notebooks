Why am I down?
For no reason
The truth is that I&#39;m really nice here
With all the individuals

A section in the cafe each with its own
And in the pub all together
Although there are also those on the well

What fun I have having a cell phone to write on
Google&#39;s mother cup
Although I could have done it without them

I need to concentrate my money
That will begin to grow
Despite aspiration I can invest some money safely
Bond does not really give anything it seems
