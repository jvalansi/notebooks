On Sunday, the sleeping beauty retires to sleep. Before falling asleep, the experimenters tell her that they will wake her once or twice, depending on the result of a fair coin toss: if the result of the toss is a &quot;tree&quot; - then a beautiful tourist only on Monday. If &quot;Fly&quot; - it airs once on Monday and again on Tuesday. She is also informed that after each awakening she will receive a forget-me-not drug, which will erase the memory of the previous awakening, and will lower her again. When she wakes up the beauty is asked what is the degree of belief that the result of tossing the coin was a &quot;tree&quot;.


There are three options, that the result was a tree (H) and today a Monday (M), that the result was a fly (T) and today a Monday (M) or that the result was a fly (T) and today a Tuesday (T)
The first option has a 50% chance of a second 25% and a third 25%
But if I say Monday today, what&#39;s the chance that a tree came out? 50% So I actually added information, I&#39;m supposed to increase the chance no?

If we were to repeat the experiment for two weeks
The chance of H
P(H) = P(H|HH)P(HH) + P(H|TT)P(TT) + P(H|HT)P(HT) + P(H|TH)P(TH)
P(H|HH)=1
P(H|TT)=0
P(H|HT)=P(H|TH)=⅓
=>
P(H) = P(HH) + ⅓*P(HT) + ⅓*P(TH)
Assuming the same probability for all options we get
P(H) = ¼ + ⅔*¼ = 5/12
And it&#39;s not half
Assuming that
P(HH)=⅙
P(TT)=⅓
P(HT)=P(TH)=¼
=>
P(H) = ⅙ + ⅔*¼ = ⅓
