If I go back to breathing, I&#39;ll probably end up thinking about money

There is also a chance that I will come to the thought of writing

But a lot more thoughts about money
I need 10,000 shekels a month
Which is like about 16 shekels clean per hour
Anything above can go towards retirement
In total, I need to accumulate about 0.5 - 1 million dollars

Why not do it the way I like for example in academia?
As long as I like it there is no reason not to

Actually there&#39;s no reason why I would rather be released early,
Where to release early? High tech! Not by day, by year
Every day going out late, it&#39;s a hard frame, but half the time,
Because I can have fun earning 20 a month and then set aside
And retire at 45
But then I completely erase those years
In academia at least I have more interest, it&#39;s probably more appropriate to what I would do if I were free

Why register?

I need to build a market prediction machine based on the text of an article
If it works, I&#39;m done I have an investment machine
