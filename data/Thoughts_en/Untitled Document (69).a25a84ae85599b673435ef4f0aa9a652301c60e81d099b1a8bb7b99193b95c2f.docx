What is my problem?
I feel I could do better.
Like get someone better, thinner, prettier, cleaner, less lazy,
But I think I’ll have the same issues with that person.
Everyone has issues.
I have been with many girls, and she is the one I’m most attracted to. That’s not to say I could find someone I’m more attractants to.
I still need something else.
I don’t know why that is
Might be related to the fact that I am a man, and I have this in my brain.
I can go to strippers. I tried that and didn’t like that.
I can invite escorts. I tried that and liked it, but it’s expensive here.
1000$~ for an hour.
Well, I’m not sure that’s worth it.
In Israel you can get for a third of that.
If the price is the issue, it shouldn’t be.
It’s just that I think, maybe I should donate to charity instead.
But I do think that taxes are kind of charity.
I’m giving more than I’m taking from the government.
I might take more when I’m older. So I’m actually also donating to myself in the future.
The government also holds an army, so not all is donation. I probably need to calculate.
Say I give 25% to the government. A third of that goes to health. But half of that goes to retirement, so actually 6% is a donation.
There’s also state taxes, which go to education and health as well, but I counted them in the 25%.
So I should probably donate like 5% more.
But to what?
I should devote some resources for the greater good.
Though the happiness maximization doesn’t align with that. Actually, if it makes me feel good it does.
So what cause should I focus on? I should think in suffering minimization terms, or maybe in saving lives or time for people. 
I can cheer people up with music generation. Make them forget the pain of existence.
So I can donate time for that. What about money? 
5% is ~300$
