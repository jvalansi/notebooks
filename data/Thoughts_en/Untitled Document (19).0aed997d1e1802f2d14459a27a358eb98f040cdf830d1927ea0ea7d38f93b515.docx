The thought is like that
As I get closer to retirement half of my income is from capital
To take me both half of the income and half of the capital it does not make sense
It&#39;s going to take me everything

Good
So we agreed
What else?
This
Was less flowing with Ashley today
As if she did not really leave the conversation flowing
But it is understandable
She probably has a lot of people on her mind
Good
Sabba
What else?
There was nothing at work
I need a plan
I will write tomorrow

Sabba What&#39;s next?
I&#39;m thinking of doing tattoos for all my grandparents
Tattoo of the symbol of life (either a tree or the symbol like a cross with a circle at the top)
A tattoo of a rose
Sun tattoo if God forbid something happens to the doll

Okay
What else?
This
There was an interesting lecture on why the world is becoming more right-wing
Basically because the Soviet Union had fallen there was no longer an alternative

Okay
What else?
This is not know
Tomorrow is Rosh Hashanah
So what?
Do not know
Good
What else?
Not too much

So what do I do with Ashley?
I want to offer her to give her my details
See what she says about it
But what details will I give her?
I&#39;m afraid to give the main email because it has my last name on it
Then she will find Facebook and Sheeran
I can just produce an email

The surfer has a situation that today is my freedom
Then I&#39;ll talk to her
And if she is not then someone else

Good
Beauty
What more?
Truth be told just two weeks ago I took a day off
So maybe I will not take now
Maybe next week
Well let&#39;s see what happens
What else?
Do not know
Okay
Sabba
