Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Today was supposed to be a day off
But because of Elior I can not take him
Sabba
tomorrow
What else?
I have to learn chess to give Fayette to Yaron
Good
What more?
I read the book that Jonathan recommended
The truth is he&#39;s nice
He argues that because the function was intended to develop he should have had self-defense
And because of self-defense he will do whatever is necessary including hurting people
Yes
It makes perfect sense
What is the solution?
Chip to the brain
If we become as smart as he is, there will be no problem
Good
What else?
poker
Okay
Do I have time for all these things?
I also need to end with the financial agreement
There are also all sorts of job interviews that may need to be prepared
lots of things
What to do?
It&#39;s a matter of habits
What did we have?
guitar
capacity
chess
poker
language?
Job Interview
dances
Book
If I dedicate to everyone (not including language) half an hour 3 times a week, it comes out 7 * 3 * .5 which is about ten and a half hours, or an hour and a half a day if you include the Sabbath
If I take off for twenty minutes it&#39;s an hour a day
If I take off twice a week it&#39;s 40 minutes a day
It&#39;s not so bad
I can do it and I will have time left for projects and such
Maybe I should decide between poker and chess
I can connect pairs of things. I can arrange from the hardest to the easiest:
Fitness / dancing
Chess / Poker
Language / Guitar
Book / Interview
Right now I&#39;m just doing dance and guitar (and singing) fitness and book
I need to replace the retarded game with poker, after I read the instructions
Chess can replace the game in the bathroom
The question is which is better
Do not know
Interview I do a question once a week
I can increase to two or three questions
What about a probability question?
Maybe really one like this and one like this (which will take 40 minutes instead of 20)
But where do I put it?
Fitness I do before a meal and a dance before a meal
I can do the same with a guitar, and a question before a guitar before a meal
Good
When do the games come in?
Poker is a matter of seconds
Chess minutes
I can switch to chess instead of a second game at the pick
