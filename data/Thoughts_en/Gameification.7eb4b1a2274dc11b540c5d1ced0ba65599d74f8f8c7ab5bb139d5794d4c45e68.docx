To do a gamification
Need to break down a goal into small tasks
Recursively
Until you reach an action that can be performed in one run

So basically for any purpose:
Division into tasks
Weight for each task

For example:
Cleaning the house
Arrangement - 10
Services - 30
Kitchen for, - 30
Bedroom - 10
Living room - 10
Arrangement
Services - 25
Kitchen - 25
Bedroom - 25
Living room - 25
And so on

So for a million dollars
Start-up - 32
Work - 40
start up
