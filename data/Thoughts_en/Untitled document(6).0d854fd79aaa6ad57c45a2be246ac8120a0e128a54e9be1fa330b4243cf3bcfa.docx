Well then Lisa has a new favorite
It really sucks
Even a little painful
Even very painful
do not know why
I really loved me
She is very pretty
And smart, looks good man
But a small chest
Do not know if it matters
It changed me in the past
With Chinita and Maayan
Both are really beautiful
But I have to breastfeed
Good
Maybe it&#39;s for the best
All for the better no?
Good
what can we do
Wait for the wound to pass
I wonder how long it will take
I was in a relationship with her for half a year in my opinion
It&#39;s quite a bit
I wonder if they will be in touch for another six months
I&#39;m really interested in how he does it
I&#39;m really interested in getting to know him
There is a situation where he looks better than me
There is a situation he just plays his cards better
Oops
Maybe I&#39;ll make a premium just so I can talk to him
I can do a week for free
Good
Good

Well this is the worst day I&#39;ve had in years
Google told me no
I think it&#39;s even worse than Lisa
But by and large it&#39;s in the same area
There is no other company I would move to it seems to me
Maybe Naorlink
As if it&#39;s not bad if I&#39;m currently in my third choice
Although the specific team is not who knows anything
On the site Is there anyone I would invest in like Lisa?
Do not know
Christiana is also really beautiful
But I do not have this connection with her
Do not know anything in it feels real
Do not know
In the meantime, I have never met anyone like that
But if I do not find someone else maybe it means something good about Sheeran
Maybe this is actually a good thing?
Maybe
Good
It&#39;s nice to look at it that way
okay, well
See if there are any openings for Naorlink I guess
So who would I go to if not for Lisa?
There was this rebellion that really flew over me
who else?
Imi G.
Maggie maybe
Oops
we will see what will be
The ones I really want are not so named after me, but maybe it does not matter, maybe I should just enjoy watching them cum
Maybe
Good
All for the best
It&#39;s really a question of whether I still think that way after these two evils
But it is true it is difficult to know at that moment whether something is for the better or not
The only physical explanation I have that everything for the better is not really an explanation but a theory
Because the second law of Thermo states that everything is for the worse, as if the rush is only rising in the system in equilibrium
But there is a situation where the opposite is also true, when the system is not in equilibrium, and there is an input of energy, then everything is for the better, that is, things work out
Is it possible to find a counter-example?
Let&#39;s look
