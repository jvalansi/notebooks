Gadkhalham
The ratio of forces is the speed of light
This is the ratio of energy - e = mc ^ 2


The situation where everyone is selfish (individualism) is evolutionarily unstable because it gives way to those who do organize and is not selfish to take over
Nothing can completely disappear when it has an advantage
