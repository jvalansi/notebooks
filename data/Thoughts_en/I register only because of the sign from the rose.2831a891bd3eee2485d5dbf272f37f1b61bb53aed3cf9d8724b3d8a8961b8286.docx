I register only because of the sign from the rose, which did not close immediately, after I remembered to keep most of the roses I closed earlier, I did not close the acronym and in fact I did not save any changes.
So I apologize in advance if it&#39;s retarded
Okay this is a lack of confidence that comes after you&#39;re sure you&#39;ve got something big
And that&#39;s exactly the wave I&#39;m talking about,
Everything is a wave in our thinking as well
The wave that goes up when we are creatively unique and goes down when we want to be like everyone else to communicate with everyone,
When people try to be too creative then they push it too much digging into what is called as I do now, so they also fall deep back into insecurity
The way to get to the Equal Valley is to trust the name to do what it needs to do, and then get to the resonant frequency and not try too hard and on the other hand try not to be like everyone else too much (this is what leads to insecurity
It also reminds me of the theory that everyone&#39;s size is 1 and only our projection on culture varies from one to another, but those whose projection on culture is low are the ones who can pull the so-called highest string, dig the deepest in their resonance
To release is to flow, and to pull at that string on the one hand to try to dig to reach some conclusion that will shock the world from selfish ego pride and on the other hand it is this side of culture to be very cultural in thinking
It&#39;s weird because when you release you become the most creative, but when you pull the string it&#39;s because you try to be the most creative
So release my brother stop writing, in resuscitation
Â 
Well, it&#39;s hard for me to shake off this desire to write, which seems to me to come from the desire to live forever, or create something that will stay after, like the urge to have a child, which comes because it&#39;s better for survival, so culture bastardizes those who remember forever, Because it is better for the survival of the culture
The ones who are remembered the farthest are the ones who lay the foundations of culture, in our society it is Abraham Moses Jesus, and also Socrates Plato Aristotle, all these are philosophers, I am not sure everyone knows who they are, our culture is instant meaning the heroes are living now, or not Long ago, like the Beatles or Britney Spears
They sacrifice the high climb in the cultural strings, meaning they sacrifice influence in favor of popularity, they could have been higher and more influential if they had not sought the material, because that&#39;s how it is, it&#39;s like two opposites feeding each other, the material and the spirit, you ascend spiritually and then With your impact you can get more material
Sometimes you want to give up eternal life to get more now, and sometimes the other way around
I unload the stella a bit
The law of paradox: A certain choice is correct if the other choice leads to a paradox
For example if I believe that in order to develop a theory I have to let go and not try to develop it by force, then the only option is to let go, because if I want to develop the theory I have to let go, because the theory says that is how I will develop it, and on the other hand if I do not want to develop it then I will release anyway
Or if you believe that in order to get a girl you have to release then the only option is to release, because if you want her then you have to release, and if you do not want her then you will release anyway
On the other hand one should not believe in these beliefs in the first place
Connects me here to the theory that women are the second class after leaders and before leaders
It&#39;s chauvinistic, but it also works the opposite. There are women who lead, but a little less, and women who are led but less,
The more indifferent a man is to women in the short term the more women he will have in the long run, the more indifferent he is the more philosophical, or something like that the more he influences culture he is more a leader, on the other hand the more conformist to culture he is less sought after, he is more controlled By the women, but he has more friends
It&#39;s a little weird how these theories come up after I smoke no?
Another point: every contrast is something that also has a contrast, for example animal and cultural are opposites but both are opposite of indifference
How do I know what&#39;s right?
What do I know?
What I decide
I have a feeling I&#39;m just deciding when to release, I mean if I dig something, I can just decide to stop or continue, if I continue I&#39;m stretching the string
The most influential in the culture are those who have pulled the string the farthest, and released
Like in a minefield when something fits a lot of things you knew then it&#39;s probably true
Morality - good and bad, logic - true false, metaphysics - there is none
There is good right, there is no bad wrong
