I want to get to work retired tomorrow
Striving not to think too much today
Maybe do exercise
It would have been best to run with music perhaps
But today is almost over
Where will I run at night?
It&#39;s not really over, there&#39;s until after 8
But I have to go to the destination and he will bring me

So how do I get retired tomorrow?
I want to finish with the need to work
But it&#39;s only another five years
And that&#39;s only if the corona does not do some serious damage here

So what do we do in the meantime?
I need to take some week off once in a while
Maybe in August
I have enough days off to do some two weeks off a year
So what do the rest of the time do?
I can work on this text-to-video project
Do not know if it competes with Apple
If so maybe do it as part of Apple

Well how does that help?
It could be a million dollar idea if it gets enough traffic
And if not, it&#39;s something to do
And that&#39;s okay

And what about work?
Everything is fine
We&#39;ll see what the plan is for the next quarter
See if Peter and these will allow me to work what I wanted
I also have the project of the intern
Do not so much know what the hazelnut
See you tomorrow
