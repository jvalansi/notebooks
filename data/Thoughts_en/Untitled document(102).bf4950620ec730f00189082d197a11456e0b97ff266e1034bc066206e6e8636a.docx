God
Why worship?
Worship makes society better
Is there less violence among believing people?
Probably not since they are of a lower socioeconomic status.
What if we control for socioeconomic status?
Still more violence less happiness in more religious countries (even when controlling for GDP)
So why religion?
To improve organization?
Why did religion survive?
Why was religion stronger than humanism in Rome?

Maybe Religion is social energy. It keeps social agents (people) closer together, and makes them stronger, more resilient to enemies and disasters.
