So how much is my time worth in retirement?
On the one hand it is worth infinity because I do not need any more money
On the other hand I am limited in my spending, so any spending over budget is worth infinity relative to my time
So maybe my alternative cost if I go back to the market
The question is whether I can even return to the market
There may not be a stage
So the value of my time decreases with time
Maybe the value is my price as a contractor
