QnA

I need to be free

Let’s do the zipline thing…
Nope
Too complicated…
Don’t feel it’s worth it…

4 years
100 paychecks

Stanford…
House…
Startup…

I need a hobby
But I don’t feel like doing anything…

Random words…

Bla bla bla

I have nothing in my head right now…
I’m just bla

I’m just living…
No passion
No nothing to live for…
It’s just seeing life going by
I mean, if we have AI we might be able to live forever
But I don’t know how to do that

I just 

Do not know
What more
What else can be added
Tomorrow another week begins
One in two hundred
Who still remained
I see nothing but freedom
I&#39;m thinking of working while working to finish with this first
I would work double if it would bring the freedom in half the time
I might be able to do those flips that are talked about in the meetup
This is an option
I can do my degree at Stanford
Do not know what it gives exactly
It gives degree points
But instead maybe I can write an article

My brain’s empty…
Lalalalalalalala
I just want to do nothing…
