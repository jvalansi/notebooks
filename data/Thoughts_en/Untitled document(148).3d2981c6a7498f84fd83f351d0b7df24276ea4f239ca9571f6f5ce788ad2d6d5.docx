What am I doing with my life?
I need 4-5 year to retire it seems
I’m making 170k± paying 30% tax, say 50k, living on 60, saving 60.
I need to get 600k to live off of. 
I have ±160k right now. I should have 200 by next May, 300 by the following July 400 by the following august, 500 the year after that, and 600 the year after that. That’s a year before I’m 40, hopefully, if everything goes well.
If we have 60 to live off of, we’re paying ±10 for taxes I think. Then we have 50 a year that’s ±4 a month. Should be enough for a good life. Probably not in SF.

If I get a job that pays 300k, I get 200k, still living on 60k, saving 140k, that’s like saving 2.3 times more. I should get to 600 in 2-3 years from now. So that’s 2 years difference. Almost half the time. Which is nice.
