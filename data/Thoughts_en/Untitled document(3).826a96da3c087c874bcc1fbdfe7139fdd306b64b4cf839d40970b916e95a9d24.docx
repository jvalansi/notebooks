Grandma Doll passed away
that&#39;s sad
It all happens together maybe it&#39;s like taking off a band-aid
It is better that everything happens in Mecca
Maybe
I need to do some language model on Grandma
Maybe it&#39;s possible to predict her speech somehow
Can be nice to be able to talk to her
Or concentrate on raising your brain to the cloud so we do not need this thing
Maybe
Good
So how do you concentrate on that?
If I were the one to decide, I would try to go for the area responsible for abstract thinking, the frontal lobe.
Trying to add more neurons there to see if it improves thought
But I guess to get there you need the whole base of hardware
I can submit a client to Naorlink
Why not actually
Good
What else?
I feel a little out of place at work
It sucks, I was really happy to start in a new place
Especially on Google
My good results are not really impressive now that there is another way to get to them
As if I had not really donated anything
so what are we doing?
I have to dig into mistakes a bit to see where this is coming from
Maybe there&#39;s some problem with the laws
I&#39;m happy about this project
I hope to finish with the project they dropped on me
I think if they ask for more than that, I&#39;ll turn it over to someone else
It sucks to have two girlfriends with so much motivation, they make me look bad
What can I do?
I do not have too many options
The part of computational learning brought someone else to do
It sucks a little
In the next quarter I might be able to do the experiment at least to see if the domain can be delivered using Morphen
Can be interesting
Good
What else?
Maybe I should develop ties out?
I&#39;m not good at it it seems to me
Maybe I should study for a degree
Maybe
With the help of the name, I will be free for another three years
With God&#39;s help
Good
What else?
I can send a client to the finance company
Okay
What more?
Fucking Lisa
I probably need to break away from her
It probably just misleads me
I probably deserve it
But I do not think I control it
If I could I would just stop what I was feeling
But it&#39;s not easy
There are other really beautiful girls who can replace her in my life
There is no prohibition in the Torah on polygamy
There is a prohibition in the law
But the law is wrong, it has to be a person&#39;s decision
As long as I do not harm anyone it is my right
Then the question arises
What about drunk driving?
In principle, there is also no law that prohibits aiming a weapon at another person
The law says do not kill, you drove drunk and killed someone so you will be punished
You drove drunk and were caught driving irresponsibly,
There is a situation that needs to be considered risk
When you drive drunk you are a danger
So where&#39;s the limit
Apparently the border as in everything is pretty gray
As long as the risk to the environment does not increase there is no need to ban the law
As the risk increases so does enforcement
So where does the line go?
One in a million risk? One in a thousand? One in ten?
Probably one in a million does not, probably one in ten does
One in a thousand is probably the border area
Maybe need a more practical approach
If a particular law does not reduce the risk then it is unnecessary
If it decreases really slightly?
Depends on how much freedom versus how much risk maybe
tough question
Much easier when it&#39;s just black and white
But life is probably not like that
Maybe you don&#39;t need rules
Maybe just always let a group of people decideâ€¦
Maybe let the machine decide
Maybe
Good
How did I get here?
Lisa
I thought maybe add her to have more than one wife
I&#39;m hitting Sheeran here
But what about hurting me
So maybe this is the trade off
Hurting me versus hurting others
How much violation of freedom is worth?
Absolute violation of freedom is death
Impairing my ability to have sex with others just so that her feelings do not hurt is already more complicated
If she does not know emotions are not harmed
Suppose she knows, I can ask what she prefers, I will go or I will stay but I will have relationships with others
Anyway it probably won&#39;t be with Lisa
Unfortunately
Do not know what happened there
I&#39;m almost sure she was really interested in me
But she never behaved the way she did with that one
I&#39;m so dying to know what was there
I have to ask someone who has been with him
Good
What else?
Do not know
Maybe mostly wait
Good
Maybe we&#39;ll see Kernel&#39;s lecture
Good
