For life you need sun, air, water and earth or other life
Why do you need sun - photosynthesis
Why do you need air - for oxygen
Why do you need water - for hydrogen
Why do you need soil - for carbon
Four Elements

The water comes from the ocean, in the ocean there is life, even without earth to decompose
So where does carbon come from? Maybe from the bottom, or from the beach?
The water also evaporates but there is no carbon in the air so there is not so much life there, even though there is some carbon,
The water evaporates and moves inland, until it encounters a mountain, or heats up enough to condense into precipitation, and descends
There is no life in the mountains, perhaps because there is little oxygen there, perhaps because the soil is not rich enough?
The water concentrates into gorges (and streams into rivers) and flows back into the ocean. In the valley there is a lot of life because of the balance of the elements.

Why did man domesticate predators?
To be hunted for him?
Were cats hunted for man?

Why exactly these three elements?
1, 4, 6

The next order of magnitude is proteins, carbohydrates and fats
Fat is the shell
The protein is the skeleton
And the carbohydrate is the energy
It&#39;s a bit like css html and javascript
Although another important part is the DNA which is the information
And the water

So it turns out that there are two other important elements: nitrogen and phosphorus

The fat consists of a hydrophilic part with oxygen and hydrogen and a hydrophobic part without oxygen
The hydrophobic part can also turn into carbohydrates which are carbon rings
The protein is pre-composed with an oxygen side and a nitrogen side that can bond between them, and a carbon body with nitrogen, oxygen and a combination of both or neither
The power of carbon is that it binds easily and breaks down easily, so it forms a skeleton for many molecules
Oxygen is negatively charged
Nitrogen is positively charged


In essence the elements that make up the world are simply God of metals.
