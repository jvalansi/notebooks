I do not know what to do
Sheeran shouted at me
So I stopped talking to her until she apologized
But I do not know if she understands that she should apologize
Even though she said I&#39;m not a robot
So it seems to me that she understands
She came and asked if I was not talking to her and I did not answer
I do not know if to tell her simply that if she wants to talk to me she will apologize
Or telling her that it really bothers me that she&#39;s yelling at me and I&#39;m not ready for that
Or just keep not talking
If I tell her, I&#39;m actually talking to her and supposedly giving up
If I continue I hurt her and me too

I was already in this situation that I said sorry to apologize and she apologized and then it happened again
So basically it&#39;s a matter of competition?
