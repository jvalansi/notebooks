Can I play a game only with the API?

Let&#39;s think of an X circle

I have to say what coordinates I play

And the page of the game will change accordingly

In summary this post is like any call to a function
This form is the parameters transmitted

And chess?
This time I choose twice from where and to where
This is basically one function

And civilization?
I choose a theme of action and a subject
There could be a number of married people I guess

But the actions vary depending on the subject
But this is already a UI problem
Logic is the same logic
The question is how much fancy form

Get to choose a topic that is simply a sequence of choices (get)
Choose a slot (place)
Each slot has themes
Every subject has actions
Each action has a subject square
Each subject slot has a marriage
