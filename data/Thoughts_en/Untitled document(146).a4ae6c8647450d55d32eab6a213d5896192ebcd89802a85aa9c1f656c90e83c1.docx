I don’t know what to do in my 3 free sessions
Oh yeah,
I have 3 free sessions a week right now
3 work sessions
3 free sessions
4 family sessions
10 work sessions
Wait, but a week has 21 sessions (3 a day - morning, afternoon, evening)
Should I have 5 family sessions?
I can aim for 4 work 3 free 4 family
Isn’t freedom the most important thing?

So today I tried gamifying my life
So I looked into creating apps
First i looked a flask, then went to electron, then cordova, then to how to convert python to js…
But I don’t know
I just don’t know what to do the have fun in my free time
I write
I like to write I guess…
Maybe I should start a blog…

What would I do if I was free?
Go fuck bitches and do cocain
I mean, is that all?
I would probably get tired of it
Well I’m not sure
Cocain is pretty addictive
But then maybe alcohol, weed and bitches?
What’s preventing you from doing that?
A wife…
As long as I don’t cheat it should be fine
My penis or mouth can’t touch her vagina or mouth
I can go to strippers
So strippers and alcohol instead of bitches and cocain
Lol
I don’t know if that’s going to make me feel much better…
Or just make me hornier and less motivated
There’s only one way to find out…
I can do an experiment
One month of strippers and booze

I don’t remember after the stripper being more prolific 
So the other hobby would be to work on projects as if they are a game
Gamify
Another option, volunteer, but then, won’t I be more productive if I just work and donate?
Don’t know

Because it’s 6 years I need to live like that now…
And then ±30 more, maybe 40?
I wish
I need to find a way to create ai to solve that mortality problem
