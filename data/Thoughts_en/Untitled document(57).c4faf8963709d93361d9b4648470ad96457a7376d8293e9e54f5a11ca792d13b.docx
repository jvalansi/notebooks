Hey whats up?
Sabba
What about you?
All is well
This weekend we are going to this festival
Friday the last day with Ashley…
On Thursday I&#39;m going to the office
A week full of activity
This is also a week of ovulation
I&#39;ll probably have sex
But what about being in the office?
I&#39;ll probably go to some stripper
And what if Ashley is?
magnificent
I would love for you to be
Maybe I&#39;ll show her the office a little
And where will I masturbate?
Probably in the bathroom
Although there is no WiFi there, there is but less,
And the lighting is shit
Where is the roundabout lighting?
Maybe in the wardrobes downstairs?
The lighting will be better in the gym but it is impossible to lock it there
What nonsense
What&#39;s their point?
I can rent a room
Isn&#39;t that an exaggeration?
Do not know
It also needs to be planned
Maybe at that Motel 6
You can stay there for $ 76 a room
segment
Okay
I got the sitting with these a bit stuck…
Well I just need to get organized on this in the morning
Good
What else?
What do I do with Ashley?
Do not know…
I was really happy for you to let me meet her
Save me from this situation
What situation?
That I&#39;m not with the most equal girl possible
Is it as worthwhile as possible?
She&#39;s really worth it
I&#39;ve seen full of women, and no one does it to me like her
What about women in the real world?
who will?
Gal Gadot?
She has no tit
Most beautiful women do not have a tit
So she&#39;s most beautiful with a tit?
What about Kate Upton? Plump
What about that one from Gustine Tiberlake&#39;s song?
Equal - Scarlett Johansson
But what until I get it always happens to me?
Tachles I would have preferred without marriage
I have no problem giving them children
But without marriage
And is it not a problem that a child grows up without a father?
Dedi Issues
Do not know
Ido has Dedi Ishuiz, but he&#39;s a nice man
who else?
Il Biran
People fire
who else?
Lior?
Can&#39;t remember anymore
Because I just do not want a marriage
I want to enjoy
What are we here for if not to enjoy
The missing hand
Everyone does what is good for them
And what&#39;s wrong with me like now just going to someone else every month?
Not bad for me
Good
so what are we doing?
Do not know…
I have no idea
And does it not bother me that I encourage a prostitution industry?
No
I support regulated prostitution
And what about women pimps?
It is not
I do not support
But I come to her, and she&#39;s independent, so no problem
But I do not know how to know
That place was with a lot of women so it looked like a pimp
But they may have a place where they banded together
And there may be a place where someone is different every day
Shorter is hard to know
But what can I do
I&#39;d rather pay for it than start a relationship
Good
What else?
Do not know
There is not too much
What about the festival?
I&#39;m a little pissed I&#39;m not contributing my share
I donate my money
But do not know
I had to just agree
okay, well
What will be will be
It will be a drug addict
I do not have much
I have letters,
There are mushrooms
There is cannabis
Good
What about work?
Do not know
I made some progress in everything I had
we will see what will be
He was interesting in politics
I did not think that a political system with two parties competes for the center, and a political system with many parties competes for the center of the coalition, which is basically one side
Although not necessarily
Why not have a center coalition
Because there is only one prime minister
But that&#39;s pretty stupid
The bigger party will take the head
that make sense
But at least the ministers will be on both sides
Why is it not like that?
