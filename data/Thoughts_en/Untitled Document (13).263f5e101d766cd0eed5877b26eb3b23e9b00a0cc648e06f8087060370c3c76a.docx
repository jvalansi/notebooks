Hey, what&#39;s up?
Sabba
What about you?
Sabba
It was a crowded weekend
Monica and Nir and Itzik
Every day was something
It was refreshing
Meet people at last
That&#39;s weird
I was sure I did not need people
But it turns out I do
segment
Maybe that&#39;s why all masturbation
Maybe
By the way masturbating tomorrow I meet Ashley
I still do not know what to do to travel to her
But it will be fine
It seems to me
What else?
Do not know
I&#39;m trying to figure out what to do
Like I do not want to get tired of her or you will get tired of me
Tachles should be limited to twice a week
Tomorrow is pretty busy anyway
I can skip tomorrow
Yes, why not
Make her miss
See what will flow
I also need to renew my license
What else?
Do not know
What about you?
Oh I also need to work on the project this week
Good
What else?
Not too much
I made myself this account that transfers $ 500 to retirement
It should be ensured that the target also has one
Sheeran will also be included
And it is better for Shiran to have 1000 not 500 and twenty years to retire not 30
Good
What else?
This politics is interesting
Even though it&#39;s American
It pretty much speaks from the point of view of winners
As if the founding event of the century is the fall of Brahma
So today they talked about al Qaeda and bin Laden
That in fact the Mogadishu did not really want to eliminate him
segment
The war on terror was a step up but did not lead to an increase in the army
interesting
It&#39;s like the interest is not economic
Or indeed economic if the one who caused it is the mercenaries
But how do you know?
You can see who the biggest mercenaries are
And do they have a clothing connection
If so, it&#39;s not &quot;academic,&quot; it&#39;s all a $ 30 million company
Maybe she&#39;s small because of the omissions
But even then, how small is it?
Aggis is much larger than 70 billion
G4S around the 3 billion
Since the airlines may have a hand in the matter
Boeing probably makes a lot of money from it
Good
But Boeing will survive even without
They&#39;re probably not bad people
But they must maximize profits
It makes more sense that what pushed there was oil
Good
What else?
Do not know
What are you telling?
Not too much
Beauty
Something else?
Do not know
At work I&#39;m a bit stuck with some thing that only happens to me
I&#39;m asking for help from there
What else?
Walla
Sheeran drove to her brother all day
That it&#39;s a turnaround for me
Too bad Ashley wasn&#39;t here today
Do not know if she&#39;s running away from me
Do not know what to do with her the truth
Who said Ashley would be better
Hard to know
Especially since Ashley doesn&#39;t even know English
Do not know if it is a barrier
She also lives in Kibinimt
Do not know if this is also a barrier
What will be will be
And if it&#39;s a baby?
As long as the sun is shining all is well
Thermo&#39;s second law says that without energy entropy increases
I wonder if there is a law that says that with energy entropy decreases
Although if you look at the entire solar system it assumes it does not receive energy
So basically her entropy goes up
Because the sun is perishable
What about crystal
It manages itself in a cyclical way without energy
