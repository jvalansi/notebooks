Okay
I&#39;m looking at how hard it is to build a website
It does not seem easy
I would be happy if there was an easy way to turn a program in the terminal into a web service
The truth is that maybe an electron can be an interesting way to do it
The dream is to just sign up for some web service, like Colab or Notebook then make it
But there are some problems here
I can not use Kolab, because I can not turn it into a server
Notebook may not work in browserâ€¦
I need to see what it&#39;s like on the iPad
I need to buy an iPad keyboard
And need a TV streamer
And need airfoods
It&#39;s not over this thing
I buy something a month
I also need to buy a gift for Sheeran
Probably something I experienced
Maybe some spa or something
I would take it to Disney, but it&#39;s expensive, about $ 100
And we are spending full money in the meantime
Fun day:
Massage will be $ 50 per person
Lunch
An evening party

We spend $ 6,000 a month, but that&#39;s because of the mortgage on the house in Alabama
So about $ 5300
I want to eat once a week to slow down my metabolism
But maybe so I can reach my target weight first

What except
Tomorrow I&#39;m on a day of kind of freedom at work
Yesterday was also a kind of day off
But not really because it was our marriage today

I could not solve the question of the acrunk
It&#39;s a basa
Find the maximum coverage of a graph using trees at a height of 1
I said look for all the combinations of heads
But there are too many of these, something like 2 ^ 50
