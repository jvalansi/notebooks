It&#39;s unnecessary what I&#39;m doing now
It&#39;s just leaning on the past
Is it meditation?
There is an argument here:
On the one hand, reliance on the past
On the other hand meditation
what&#39;s right?
Why is it relying on the past?
Because I think about what to think
Do I confirm this claim?
If I did not do that, what would I do?
Do not know
So basically it&#39;s not meditation
Because I think what to do
Is it impossible to write in Fluo mode?
Am I in the flu now?
Probably not because I needed to fix something
