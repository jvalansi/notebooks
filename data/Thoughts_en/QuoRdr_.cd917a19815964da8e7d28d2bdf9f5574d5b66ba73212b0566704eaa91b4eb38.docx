I want to do a service that allows ordering in restaurants through the web

Steps:
Put a QR code in restaurants on a stand that is on every table - the code refers to the site that directs them to the menu (from yelp for example)
Enable menu search
Allow ordering through the menu
Allow payment through the menu

what is needed:
Order stands
Order QR codes that target my server
Make the server redirect correctly
Go to restaurants and get them to place my stands
Send an email
Go physically
Contact
to advertise

If I want to look professional, I need:
site
Logo
(video)

$ 1 million a year:
Sell the service for ten dollars a month, to 80,000 restaurants
Cities have letâ€™s say fifty percent of the Western world, and ten percent of India and China
It&#39;s an order of magnitude of a billion
For every maximum of 100 people there is a restaurant
There are an order of magnitude of millions of restaurants in the world
It has a potential of hundreds of millions of dollars

Suppose I double my sales every year
I need 80000 in five years
In year four 40,000
In year three 20,000
In the second year 10000
In the first year 5000

How do I get to 5000 a year
That&#39;s 400 a month
It&#39;s 100 a week
