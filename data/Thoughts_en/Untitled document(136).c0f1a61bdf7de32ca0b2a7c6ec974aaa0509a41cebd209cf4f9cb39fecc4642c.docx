what am I doing
She disgusts me
I&#39;m stuck
I do not want to hurt her, because to stay at 35 without anyone, and without children is a dick
But what about me
In this case she will hurt more than I hurt from staying
I do not know if I would be better off with someone else
I do not think monogamy is supposed to work
Some people say that their other half is everything
It makes sense that a marriage should be happy at least half the time
Although I&#39;m not sure if my life is happy at least half the time
ססעמק
I&#39;m stuck
