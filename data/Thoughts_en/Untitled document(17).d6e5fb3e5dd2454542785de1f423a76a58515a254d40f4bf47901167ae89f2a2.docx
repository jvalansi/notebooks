Hey, what&#39;s up?
How was yesterday?
Sabba
It seems to me the main thing is the new investment strategy
Besides, I also feel that I have made progress in raising my brain to the cloud

There are many things
There are things of Shabbat
Things of Rosh Chodesh
interview
And strategy

The most important interview
I need to plan how to prepare for a Google interview
Go over to System Design, and machine learning and language processing
It is much

On Saturday I solve a question going through the emails and planning the week
So I solved a question, I can go through the emails
The program for this week is the plan to prepare for a big interview
That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing now in a big way

What about the things of Rosh Chodesh and the investment strategy?
Of the two, I prefer to suffice for the things of Rosh Chodesh, to keep the cycle
Investment strategy can be postponed a bit
Yes I would rather hit the iron when it is hot
But I do not have timeâ€¦
Maybe I&#39;ll have time
It also writes code, maybe it will help the interview

Good
So what do we have?
To plan the week, it&#39;s to think of a strategy to learn for Google
Leave time to go through system, machine learning and language processing
How long? One evening
Suppose by dinner I go through emails and plan the week
Dude, let&#39;s see if I have time for Rosh Chodesh

Let&#39;s finish with the emails
It seems to me that there is not too much

Maybe think of significant events I want to talk about?
That we have come a long way with the Code Week project
That I presented my work at an Apple conference, and another joint work was accepted for the conference
That I have a number of projects that are currently in production
I got oxide on team work
That my principal took me with her to a new team
First place users -
Push Data Drive Development

What more?
I can look at the feedback I have received in recent years
And for what I wrote down about myself, to collect situations

What about hypothetical questions -
