what&#39;s going on?
All is well
Yesterday we landed
I woke up at a quarter to five because of the divorce
I need to ask Shiran for the melatonin
It will probably take two weeks for him to pass
As always
Maybe melatonin will help
seen
They said maybe fasting, maybe
What else?
Today I have to finish the blah blah course
Spark course
And also go over lectures from ACL
This
Then a weekend
What do we do on the weekend?
Do not know
Not too much probably
Too bad we did not bring the hdmi cable and it is still on my list
I just did not look
okay, well
Maybe you can order online
Because then you can see things on TV instead of on the iPad
Apart from TV, what is being done?
There is a sea view
But what does it give?
It&#39;s nice to sit sometimes
But a chair is missing here
The place is beyond what I expected
Really nice hotel room
Huge bed
Small balcony with sea view
Great TV
Bath and shower with cool stream and hot water
Not such suffering
We can see things on the iPad
Do yoga, dance
We&#39;ll get along
Maybe we&#39;ll play games
I will also work on the project maybe
I do not have the laptop, but we&#39;ll manage
Maybe I can work with the iPad
interesting
how?
I need to edit the code in GitHub
The question is whether it is possible to update the app
Maybe in the UI
You can try
If so, it could actually make me give up a computer and switch to an iPad
See if and where we get stuck
What else?
Now it will be harder for me to do c2c we are both in the room 24/7
I can take the iPad to the bathroom from time to time
I can not record but it&#39;s small
You can make baths and such
Good
What else?
In two weeks my sister is getting married
Her future husband and basically my whole family is pretty extreme leftist
For them, Bibi is the enemy
But in the end this is about values
There is no right and wrong
You can agree on what is more important and what is less important and then look at data, but the problem is look at what is more important and what is less important
Equality is more important to them and freedom is more important to me
Freedom - national freedom
Freedom - Private freedom
Another distinction
Freedom - The Restrictions of Freedom Concerning Global Freedom, the freedom of one individual will not infringe on the freedom of another individual
Freedom - Private freedom

Why freedom always goes with religion
