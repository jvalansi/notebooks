Hi
How are you?
Ok
What’s on your mind?
Nothing
Nothing?
I think so
Ok, what would you like to do?
I don’t know
If money wasn’t a problem what would you do right now?
Probably order food
If nothing was a problem, no limits, what would you do?
Fly
What would you do if you only had physical limits
Sex with Bar Rafaeli
And then?
Run for president
What would you do if you only had physical and law limits
Are law limits that strict?
I can’t be president
I can make fake credentials and stuff
I probably won’t though
What else?
I would create an intelligent machine
I have to gamify my life
Break it down to steps.
Each day try to complete a step.
Until the whole thing is complete.

So how do you know all the steps in advance?
How do you even know how many are there?

So I want to build a intelligent machine.
How do you do that?
Well, you need computation power for that.
How do I imagine this thing?
A model that gets input (text/photo/video), and provides output (text, silence, maybe action)
So it’s basically a machine learning model.
I need to find the state of the art right now.
I need to identify what’s missing
I need to help bring what’s missing.
Repeat until goal is achieved.
Ok so first step is find SOTA
2 identify weakness
Fix weakness
Repeat
That doesn’t sound so hard…
What about the money project?
Good question…
What do I prefer to do:
Build an intelligent machine?
Build a trading machine
Well the intelligent machine will also a good trader probably, but it will take much longer - 
I’ve been working almost 4 years on the trading machine... 
Another approach
