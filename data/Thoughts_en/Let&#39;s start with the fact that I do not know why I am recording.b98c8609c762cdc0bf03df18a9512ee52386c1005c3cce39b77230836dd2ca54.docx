Let&#39;s start with the fact that I do not know why I am recording
Who will read it?
I need a more orderly thought and then maybe write a book

Of money
The one who contributes more earns more
Suppose there is a certain amount of money that is received, then the larger the portion distributed as a donation the larger the next amount will be
People will still consume now, that must, but less,
It is thus possible to normalize the distribution of income
The problem is that it requires a central system, and it never works
Maybe if the system is man-free, and there is no room for corruption, then it will work
Maybe computing can do that, a system like Bitcoin
Maybe it&#39;s a normal distribution creature
Currently the distribution is abnormal
In communism a normal distribution such as a delta function (it is possible to register a delta function as normal with a standard deviation tending to zero)
The Gini index aspires to communism, only when everyone has equal income, the slope of the graph is fixed
For a normal distribution the slope will go up to the middle, and then it will fade away, because the decrease in the number of people fades faster than the amount increases (income increases linearly and cruises fade exponentially)
In capitalism the slope only increases, the income increases faster than the distribution fades
Is it not directly due to capitalism?
If I give free market, can I predict how income will be distributed?
Everyone takes raw material and turns it into something, and earns the difference between how much it cost him and how much he sells
Most often the raw material includes his personal talent, the price is determined by supply and demand
If the thing is rare and sought after its price is higher
Suppose a simple world
There are only 2 products, and two people, one produces food and two produces clothes
They can simply agree that one will produce the food for both of them and the other will supply the clothes
It is possible to determine that the time of food production is equal to the time of production of clothes, and then they simply change product after working the same amount of time
The problem starts when there are fewer types of consumer products, because then a certain product can take over a market and lead to a monopoly, and then capital is concentrated in one place, over a few people.
For example: housing, communications, money (bank), food, transportation,
The truth is that it&#39;s almost everything
In housing, everyone wants to live in Tel Aviv
In the truth media they put in competition (there are still only 3 big companies)
The money has 3 large banks
In food there is about one type of food company
There are also relatively few companies in transportation (and huge taxation)
There is nothing to do it also stems from the fact that we herd, tend to cluster around one product



Fermi Paradox -
If within the order of millions of years we are supposed to take over the entire universe given that it is free
So any culture that has emerged in the last billion years would have already appeared, it should happen in those million years, low chance of a collision between such events
The chance that two life forms will be created at the same time is like the chance that we will take 10 corn kernels and the first explosion will be of two kernels at the same time
For 100 nuclei the chance of two exploding together is low (rarely happens) and the difference between 2.5 minutes and a tenth of a second of the explosion is much lower than a thousand
The truth is that the ratio is pretty much the same, there are 100 nuclei and 600 tenths of a second in 1 minute, and there are 10000 suitable stars and the difference between a million and a billion is 1000
The chance that exactly the first of about 10000 explosions will be of two is not high, because it happens about one in 10
(Ten every million years, out of a billion that everyone &quot;explodes&quot;, at first it explodes every second or so, that means a 1 in 10 chance, it&#39;s about the amount, so maybe it&#39;s about 50 50)
Assuming a normal distribution it is like measuring 10,000 people, and that the two lowest will be about the same millimeter, or the highest
After all, this chance is certainly lower than the chance of taking just two people from the range where the heights are closer (around the average)
And around the average the chance is low, so sure it is lower at the edges
No matter how many people there are, the chances of me choosing two at the same height is nil
Although with 10000 in the same 1000 it should be quite common. The chance that this will not happen in a given second, is that each teen will do it separately,
If there are enough (say 10 ^ 10) then it is likely that the lowest are at the same height, because most people will be at the same height, then they are divided within a range of meters, but still the chance of taking two averages at exactly the same height is to my detriment,
Ok because it&#39;s not true it&#39;s not like choosing two at the same height, it&#39;s the chance of having someone at the same height for someone random, and that chance is actually high in the area around the average when there are a lot of people
In this world there is a billion and the chance of it is low, there is someone sure of my height, but the peak of the low is probably alone there, in most competitions the result is normally distributed, and the peak is one, most Guinness records are of normally distributed phenomena, and there is almost always one peak, and reasonable Assuming they represent all human beings, if there was someone better he probably would have tried, most people (at least in the western half) know the Guinness records
Conclusion Chances are there are no aliens

Puzzle:
Or with him the sum, or the difference of the other two
He knows that if one is listed 65 for the other X and the third is listed
Y = 65 +/- X
Two sees 65 and Y
Tuesday sees 65 and X

Suppose
Y = 65 + X
It cannot be that X = 65, Y cannot be 130
It cannot be that X = Y
I want a situation where
Y = 65 - X
Cannot exist, i.e. Y = X
It will not happen

Suppose
Y = 65 - X
Then need a situation in it
Y = 65 + X
Can not exist, because Y = X
That&#39;s not going to happen either


Automatic tag retrieval
Each topic gets tags
That way you can know what I&#39;m mostly writing about
You can also divide the tags into groups, to see topics, and domains
It needs to find a hierarchy between tags, closeness between words
 
Why do I need input?
Because my brain is constantly processing it is simply its static state, there is a constant flow of energy to the brain, and if there is no input it is
