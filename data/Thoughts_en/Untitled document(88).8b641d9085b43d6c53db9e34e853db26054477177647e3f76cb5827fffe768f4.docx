so what are we doing?
I can check out the opportunities on crowdstreet
Okay…
And Bill Bava&#39;s opportunity

Good
what else…


This is what except חוץ
what is the plan?
I will find orders at 50k
Maybe 2 a year
That should be enough
That way every five years I have between 250 and 500k invested
And are supposed to yield 100k on average per year…
I can live with it…
Finding an investment can be a two-week process when I am experienced
I guess you have to choose from between 10 and 100 deals let&#39;s say, 20-30 maybe
I can analyze a deal in a few minutes to an hour let’s say
Or can I pay someone to do it for me…
What else?
is nothing
Intermittent passing
I only eat between 12 and 20
Lunch at 12
I eat a snack or two
Then dinner at 8 p.m.

For lunch I usually eat some meat dish like chicken or salmon or beef, with some side dish like mashed potatoes or mac and cheese or rice, and a salad
For dinner it is usually toasts with cheese and avocado and egg and tuna, and then oatmeal with some chocolate and milk cornflakes.
Basically snacking on cookies and some salty snack (Doritos or something)

Do not know if it is enough calories…
I miss the calories of breakfast…

Well what else
