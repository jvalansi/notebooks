I might be bored
I don’t know what to do
I want my hobby to be neural nets
But it doesn’t feel like a hobby
It feels like work
That’s why I wanted to gamify
But I don't know how
All I need is to write how much do I profit and how much time it takes
That’s it
But how much do I profit from a nn generated music?
Maybe I can set the final score, for example what would be the goal of this?
To have beautiful music for ever 
That’s a nice goal, it has a score that I can split to steps
