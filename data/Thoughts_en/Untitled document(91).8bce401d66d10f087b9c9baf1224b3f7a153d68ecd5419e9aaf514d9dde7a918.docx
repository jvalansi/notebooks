Well this week I&#39;ll try to get to something that trades for me in day trading
The goal is to exceed 1.5% per month
By and large with syndicates I should be able to reach 20%
That it&#39;s already amazing…
I built on 10%
Most people trust 4%
But with 20% and a million dollars, we no longer have to work…
Then I start thinking about donation…
Set aside ten…
Although I set aside more than that in taxes…
Taxes it let’s say a third, out of that quarter it’s federal, and only two-tenths is state.
The state is primarily for education and health.
The federal is divided into medatorial (two-thirds) and discreet (one-third).
The discreet is half security and half other things like transportation and education
Mandatory is about a little less than half health (Medicare Medicaid) and a little less than half Social Security, the rest is other things.
So in addition to what goes into security, it&#39;s a kind of contribution.
Although I too will make a profit from it, but probably not at the level I give…
How can this be calculated?
This doctor is for the elderly
Medicaid is for the less able. So for sure I pay for them, something like a quarter (sixteenth) of the salary, which is 6%.
Okay, so let&#39;s say 4% contribution
Where should it go?
Do not know
I think what will save the most lives is autonomous cars
What will give the most years of life is to raise the mind to the cloud…
Elon Musk

Well what else?
I want to buy Shiran tickets for the minister for his birthday…
There is also this thing of friends
And there is also the trip to Yosemite…
Lots of happenings

What else?
We were at Maya&#39;s yesterday for her birthday, it was nice, but can not say I flew there on someone too much…
We&#39;ve been to Joey&#39;s too, but can not say I flew there too much for anyone…
Bummer,
It is not easy to find people in the exact same head…
What connected me, my father and Eyal, was our horniness.
People like Ziv I have not met too much…
Or Yaron…
Perhaps Itzik is the closest…

Maybe I should learn some debate…
maybe not…
It will take me so long as soon as I finish with the piece of money
Jesus, this is not an easy thing to do.
I will tell my children first of all to finish with the part of the money, to do some business and that&#39;s it, that they will do what they want.
I could have finished with it at age 30, if I hadn’t spent so much time on school.
Well my parents seem to fire at 65 (pretty awesome) so maybe I have some more time to do things.
What would I like to do?
Well I have no idea
I want to take a sabbatical,
This is my fifth year here. Next year is the sixth year, after which I would love to go on sabbatical.
With the help of the name then I will have 500 thousand, with the help of the name they will make 20% and then I will be a free person.

What else?
Do not know the truth…
Trying to think
Maybe make music?
I have all day
what am I doing?
Meet to talk to strangers…
What do I want to talk about?
