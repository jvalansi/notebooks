This
I talked to Zivna and Daniel today
It was nice
Ziv dreams of becoming a startup for stylists
I talked to Daniel about money
He says he needs $ 8 million
He says that with how much he earns it is not enough
Because he wants to buy a house
Because you have to buy a house
That I do not think it is true
The chances of the landlord coming to evict me are pretty low
This is always the reason why to buy an apartment
The question is how much is it worth
This insurance
Suppose you buy a house in this country 4% at best, usually 3%
But suppose 4%
You rent at 6 thousand, a year it&#39;s 72, so a house costs 6 * 12 * 25 = 1.8 million
So you put on the 20% side it&#39;s about 350,000, which you would make 8% on
And a mortgage, which is pretty low, comes out to about the same money
So the main difference is the initial capital
And you pay for repairs and such
That is about 30,000 shekels a year
The question is whether you would pay 30,000 shekels in insurance that would not blow you away
Mortgage payment does not change though
It depends on which route you take
If you do not index-linked then it is fixed forever
