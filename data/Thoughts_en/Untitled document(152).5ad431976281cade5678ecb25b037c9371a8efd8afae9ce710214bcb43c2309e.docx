Then the light passes from side to side
But then the checkpoint is forever
Every object has a potential for movement
This is because e = mc ^ 2
Each particle can have any velocity up to c
So it has potential from the very ability (potential) to move
But as he moves, so does the potential of the movement
Yes, but it starts with zero potential
It&#39;s another energy, kinetic energy, if you give up weight, you pay in motion
This is the distance from zero mass
In the frequency space we move coordinates to the velocity axis (not the weight)
The higher the frequency the more energy there is, then there is energy which is the distance from zero frequency

Maybe there&#39;s something there, maybe not
Maybe feeling is important enough to know how to go in that direction
But what&#39;s the point, it&#39;s not what I learned
