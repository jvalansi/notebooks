Budget analysis
I spent 77k instead of 70
On housing I was supposed to spend 36 and I spent 45
But it&#39;s mostly because of the apartment
And the apartment makes money
On food 11.5k instead of 9.5 (21%)
When on restaurants 4.7 instead of 4.2 (11%)
And on bars 1.4 instead of 0.6 (130%)
I did not go over trips
But about renting a car 1.6 instead of 1.2 (33%)
On shopping, 4 instead of 3 (33%)
On Entertainment 4.3 instead of 3 (43%)
On 3.2 accounts instead of 2.4 (33%)
About Transportation 2.4 instead of 0.6 (300%)


I earned 5 on taxes
I also spent 1.3 on gifts

I can do an analysis of scattered expenses
For example food
Or transportation

I need to start a business to separate business expenses and privacy

There is no significant deviation here
10% is not terrible
It&#39;s a bass if I live on the scales
But with a million dollars it&#39;s not supposed to happen

Well what else
Investment analysis needs to be done
Can&#39;t find an app for it
Good
What to do?
We&#39;ll sleep on it
Tomorrow is the wedding
Good
Tomorrow I will also sit down with Sheeran for the interview
Good
What else do I have to do?
What is the hazelnut?
What is there besides investment analysis?

This is my brother
To enjoy
If I do 18% with the syndicate I&#39;m done
That&#39;s all I need
Name 50k every year
Until I have 300k every year in the syndicate
Will make 60k
The rest of the 700 will do another 60 maybe

Tachles I do not spend 6.5 a month
I spend 5.7, another 0.8 is on a mortgage and such on an apartment
That it really is not much
Less than 70 a year
I can raise the shopping at some 0.1 and still be below 70
Sabba
It&#39;s nice I only need 70
As if it&#39;s not that little yes
Sure with inflation it will be more, yes

Well I need to do an LLC and a bank account for the property
That will not appear to me as an expense
it&#39;s confusing
Maybe I need some accountant

How do I analyze the investments?
