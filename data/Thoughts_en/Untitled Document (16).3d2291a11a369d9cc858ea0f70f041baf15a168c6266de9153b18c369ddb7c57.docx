Hey whats up?
Sabba
What about you?
OK
So what do you say?
Tomorrow I&#39;m supposed to meet that one
I wonder how it will be
She says she does body to body
I wonder if face to face
And if she&#39;s done
If you can touch her
Good
we will see what will be
What else?
A little cold
it&#39;s windy
Good
Want to enter?
Soon
I&#39;m a little scared it&#39;s ruining my mood
Instead of building I force myself to do it
That it will not take me down from the songs
And from sitting on the roof
Good
I need some sun
Seems healthy to me
Good
What else?
At work Sabba
I did not deliver everything
But I did what I could
Not as productive as in the office
But much more than I was
Do not know whether to take freedom in Yom Kippur
I will try to take
Seems important to me
Well what else?
Interesting lectures I see
From what I understand the increase in incarceration is because of the drugs
They must do something about it here
This causes many more minorities to be in jail
It causes discrimination
It causes racism
To poverty
I would say that whatever you want to do you will do as long as you do not hurt anyone else
But then the question is what about the drug dealer
Is he hurting someone else?
Indirectly yes
But also the seller of cigarettes
And the seller of alcohol
Are they guilty?
How do you decide which drug is allowed and which is not?
In my opinion everything should be allowed
What is important is to clarify the danger
Once it is from an institution it is supervised
We need to see what is happening in Portugal
Good
What else?
This is Please Arf
Next week we should have a meeting with the counselor
we will see what will be
I wonder if Sheeran would like to lie down for the weekend
we will see what will be
We will flow
So what did we say about flow?
Advantages and Disadvantages?
There are things that are not enough data, they can not be solved with rules, you just have to learn from experience, and trust the emotion
Disadvantages:
There is no way to know what is right if there is no law, the emotion is influenced by a culture that is not necessarily right, I may be acting out of brainwashing.

But what is the option?
Think about the logical answer?
Is there a logical answer?
Outside of math there is no 100%, maybe we are in simulation
So the scientific method
Trial and error, model building, and so on and so forth once the observations are inappropriate
So what does the scientific approach say about sleeping with Sheeran?
Do I have enough observations about it?
I can weigh pros versus cons
but why?
Why does it matter?
If I have no preference anyway why decide in advance?
By and large I prefer not to have more fun with that one
But on the other hand maybe it&#39;s not good to come to it loaded
So what comes out I am greatly satisfied.

And what about the show when I meet her?
what&#39;s the point?
Maximize fun
I want to finish it
I want you to ride my bulbul
And how do you do that?
Face to face
But maybe my back will do it for her, and I&#39;ll be less horny in the meantime, maybe it&#39;s good
So all for the better
And what about touching her on matters?
Maybe she can finish herself faster?
we will see what will be
All for the best
