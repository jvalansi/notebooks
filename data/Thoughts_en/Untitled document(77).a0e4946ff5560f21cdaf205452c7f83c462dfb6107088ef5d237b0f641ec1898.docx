I have full emails of recruiters
Can be interesting
Although not bad for me
I would probably switch to Google or Neurlink
But other than that it does not seem to me

There is the startup
There is the investment in the syndicate that needs to end
There are the study statistics
Google&#39;s course

The startup is supposedly urgent because every week there is a meeting
The most important thing is the statistics
Maybe Google&#39;s course can cover that
Can I try to do both?
I can try
So on the go Google course
And the start-up at home?
I can do the course as part of the trip there
I also need to do the fast ai course
If we really meet on Thursday…

So the rest of the recruiters are irrelevant…
I&#39;m not really looking at the moment
And what about reading what needs to be read?
This is what I usually do when traveling
