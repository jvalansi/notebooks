I would be happy if I had another way of doing what I am doing right now
Suppose we write it down in the wiki
But there is nothing with offline capabilities
Soon we will not need offline capabilities
Because we will always be online
Then I would like to use a service like GitHub
That I&#39;m straight writing code, like suppose a notebook,
And I can in the same breath also write todo
