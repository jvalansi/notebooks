So what are we doing here? Are we folding are we shaking?
What’s the plan?
Recession?
News2Roi?
Courses?
Music?
Arabic?

I don’t know




I guess recession is interesting and urgent, and I should look into it again
Previously I couldn’t really make use of that…
New2Roi is my current project
Maybe Music will be next
I should do courses as part of my ride home or something…
What about Arabic?
It’s a course…
I can do it on the ride
