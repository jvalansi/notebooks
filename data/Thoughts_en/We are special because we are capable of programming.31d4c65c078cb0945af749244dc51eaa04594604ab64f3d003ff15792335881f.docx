We are special because we are capable of programming
You can program us
There is no other animal with such a mechanism
We sometimes think and come to a decision junction that activates the decision network in the brain, this network considers many factors before making a decision. Sometimes also factors programmed by our knowledge. In the case of humans it is not limited to private knowledge but to collective knowledge (even in some animals it is not limited only to private knowledge but in a much more limited way). The collective is able to program the individual, and that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing, it brought us here.
We&#39;re basically like a computer,
A day will come and most people will prefer to give birth to their son at home in a computerized version, and that will be the end of humanity in its present fleshly form (unless computers have flesh and blood then, because that might have an advantage)
Perhaps genetic programming will increase our abilities to coordinate any computer that can be produced in any other way
By Moore&#39;s law, our head is supposed to hold the entire amount of information for each amount.
