I have too many places with things to do
Miles
Reading List
Asana
Tasks
How do I center everything?
This is similar to what happens at work

By and large all missions should be in asana
I need to download more than I put things on a reading list
I can also enter the emails

By and large, emails are usually more urgent matters
But I just need to put them with a date

The reading list does not really work
I do not deserve everything
At work I barely finish what&#39;s in the mail

I just have to decide what&#39;s important

The list is also not synchronized between browsers
