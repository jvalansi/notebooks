Coming back to the history of the world

We started as climbing rodents
We learned to walk
We took over the world
We sat down
Built a house
Domesticated some animals
Domesticated some plants
No restriction of travel costs so no restriction on group size
Groups get bigger and more hierarchical 
Groups became villages
Villages became cities
Cities united to form countries

What information can I get on cities?
They are in general separated into:
Resident area
Commercial area
Industrial area
(public area)
City council
Parks
Schools
Temples?
Hospitals

I can check employment by city or metropolitan area apparently:


So I can see the info from the most rural, backwards settlements to the most advanced, see the progress of human societyâ€¦

So the GDP per capita is proportional to the household income
