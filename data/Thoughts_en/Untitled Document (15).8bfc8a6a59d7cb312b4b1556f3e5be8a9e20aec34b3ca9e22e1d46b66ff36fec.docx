Is the real world transitive?
Transitive is that if a&gt; b and b&gt; c then a&gt; c
But suppose a paper stone and scissors is not transitive
And there is this section in the election
If you add a candidate it could be that someone else wins, because it will split one side for example
But does that mean non-transitive?
Not necessarily
So there is a breaking of transcendence in nature?
Maybe people would prefer A to B and B to C but C to A?
I think so
Suppose there are 3 divisive issues
And candidate A for issue a
Candidate in favor of subject b
And in favor of c
A vs. B: Candidate A will receive votes for A, candidate B will receive votes of B.
C votes will get suppose candidate a that more supportive than b
B vs. C: Candidate in votes of B, C of C, and will go to C because C is more in favor of B
C vs. A: C of C, A of A, B will go to C because more in favor of b
parable
The world is not transitive
All mathematics does not apply to him
I wonder at what level it is starting to become transitive
