What to do
What do I do with my life
Come on let&#39;s release the video
Or maybe we&#39;ll pay ~ $ 40 for a Faber video
Or I&#39;ll make something myself

I was really happy to be able to make videos
But it requires a lot of energy
I can make a presentation easily
I can also add animation
But how do I add characters
If it were possible to add gifs as you could add a clipart
It is possible, but it is not simple

The options seem to be:
15. photoshop	34 (0.5%)
11. after effects	23 (0.4%)
32. powerpoint	17 (0.3%)
42. sketchup	13 (0.2%)
52. powtoon	9 (0.1%)
57. maya	9 (0.1%)
69. iclone	8 (0.1%)
72. videoscribe	7 (0.1%)
81. cs6	7 (0.1%)
96. blender	6 (0.1%)
98. premiere	6 (0.1%)
177. adobe flash	4 (0.1%)
160. inventor	4 (0.1%)
163. roblox	4 (0.1%)
173. unity	4 (0.1%)



Photoshop / After Effects / Premier / cs6 / Flash costs something like $ 50 a month and it requires some work
Poutons cost a minimum of $ 80 - but you can get a free version with their logo
I have PowerPoint for free - but it requires a little more work
Video writing is like the Poutons but maybe cheaper but with fewer options
This sketchup / inventor is for 3D modeling
Maya / Aiklon / Blender / Roblux / Unity is three-dimensional
