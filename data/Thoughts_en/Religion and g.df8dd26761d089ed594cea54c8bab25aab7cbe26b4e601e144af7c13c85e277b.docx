So if we remove god from the equation, religion is just an ideology, a law system.
The problem is adding god to that equation.
Why do we need god there?
What if we just say, oh that’s a nice set of rules and that’s it?
Like the Hamorabi laws.
That’s not a problem, though for some reason I can’t think of any that made its way all the way to today.
You can argue that Buddhism does not contain a god, but just an enlightened person.
Democracy is a pretty old set of rules that survived nicely as well, but isn’t as comprehensive as religion.
Is there anything comparable today?
Maybe communism/capitalism.
Actually capitalism is a bit more permissive it seems.

I guess just a book of laws wouldn’t be as viral as a religious book.
A religious book contains a story.
And also a reason for the laws, and not just because I said so.
If it was just because I said so kind of thing it would only last till that person dies.
So you need an immortal entity there.


So all I’m saying, the idea behind religion is nice, they just want to say “be nice”.
Leave god aside, isn’t it a good idea?
So basically people are fighting over the way you should be nice to each other.
All the religions say that.
Communism also kinda says that.
Nationalism also kinda says that, I guess.
Capitalism is different, it doesn’t say how you should be nice though, it actually kinda says you don’t have to be nice, even by taking care of your needs, you’ll improve society.

How does that work with being in the moment?
Maybe there’s room for both.
This is kind of a nihilistic approach.
So nihilism could sit together with any ideology?

But then doesn’t god say to be nice to each other?
Well then be in the moment god doesn’t really say that, I think…

So, maybe all the ideologies are actually a mix of ideologies, mix of stories.

Maybe abraham, was somewhere where the god story was successful, and tried it somewhere else.

Why worship?
Because worship makes you stronger and happier.
So is it about happiness, or about energy?
Maybe happiness is energy?

I wonder if a computer can distinguish between actual stories and made up stories, that’s basically say if someone’s lying…
I wonder if you can do that just by content.
Could it distinguish between I’m sitting on my chair to I’m standing in the kitchen?

Maybe constantine saw how well the jews are staying together that he decided to invent christianity to do the same thing for rome

So should one always flow?
Always be in the moment?
Is planning a bad thing?
Can you be in the flow and plan?
You should flow if you want to be happy,
But do you always want to be happy?
Sometimes you want to be creative maybe…
But if nothing is important, why do that?
Why not be happy all the time
If that’s what you want to do.
But do you?
If you should do what you want to do, and you want to be creative and not happy, you should be creative.
But then you’re not happy, 
So what should you do? What makes you happy, or what it is that you want to do?
Well, if you want to maximize the integral, sometimes you shouldn’t do what you want to do.
But then we always do what we want to do, we had to want to do it in order to do it.
This is pretty complicated now it feels.

There are 2 options:
Do what makes you happy (in the long run)
Do what you want to do.
But we always do what we want to do, so does that mean that we never do what makes us happy? No it just means we did both at the same time.
So it’s not always contradicting. But maybe sometimes.
And then we should choose to do what you want to do right?
That’s the only possible choice, because if I did it, I wanted to do it.
So all we need is to try to make everything we want to do the thing that makes us happy.

Mati says it’s all excuses, and that the first man didn’t think that.
Maybe he didn’t think about energy, maybe he did?

Society is a fractal, because everything is a fractal.
Except man made things, is society man made?
Good question.
To some degree for sure, and probably that means it’s a fractal to some degree.

You should always want to do what makes you happy in the long term

So does paying taxes go there? Yes, i guess.
What about smoking, I’d want to smoke even though it’s shortening my life span and my happiness. So I shouldn’t smoke, but then I smoke, and that’s what I wanted so that’s what I should have.
Should I always do what I want to?
There’s no other option.
But I should want to do what makes me happy in the long term.

Why don’t people teach capitalism from kinder garten?
Because this is a government expense, and the government cares about it self…
So if we have anarcho capitalism, how would people behave?
Should we trust the “missing hand” (that’s god in the capitalist mythology)
But sometimes there are market failures, the markets can’t resolve.
But most times, the government makes it worse rather then better…
Well maybe not, but maybe more times than with government.
Maybe,
Can we simulate that?
I’d love to…
But how?
Machine learning…
But we don’t have enough data.
What are the variables?
Market failures, freedom or government intervention.
Can we check if the government intervention helped.
I can probably list some market failures
Then check government intervention.
Then check if we need more or less.
No need for machine learning
But you do need to read about market failures
Check their distribution in reality,
And sample a couple for each type.
