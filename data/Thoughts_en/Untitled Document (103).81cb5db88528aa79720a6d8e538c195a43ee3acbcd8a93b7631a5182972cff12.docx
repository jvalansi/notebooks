What do I do now when I&#39;m with Sheeran
How do I continue to study?
I can on evenings when I have no goblins go for coffee
But it&#39;s only two evenings
On weekends as long as there is no plan I can go for coffee
This is 3-4 times a week
Every day I have 3 segments of about 4 hours of work
Until lunch
Until dinner
Until bedtime
A total of 21 sections per week of 84 hours
About 84-90 segments a month of about 360 hours
About 1100 sections per year of about 4400 hours
10 of the weekly sessions go to work
I also do not count sleep that is equivalent to two sections a day
I was left with 11 sections for me and Sheeran
It sounds reasonable to me to give Shiran 6
I can make the hazelnuts of the palms, make one in the weekend
Then 3 times go for coffee
Once more twice a weekend
Sounds reasonable
Each section in a cafe costs about $ 7
This means that this week it comes out ~ $ 30-35,
$ 120-150 ~ in about a month
Not a little at all
