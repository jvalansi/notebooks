Hey whats up?
Sabba
What about you?
All is well
What are you telling?
Walla
We sat with Javier and spent the night at sea
it was really nice
Finally seeing people
We talked a lot
We got a little out
Although I feel like the night is a little difficult with us
She is very left-wing
So anything a little very sensitive bothers her
But okay
Javier gets a little more accepting
He is also against this section that there is a rule of the elders of the people that has a lot of influence
But it was interesting to hear
This is what&#39;s besides that?
Not too much
Another weekend is over
I&#39;m kind of waiting for tomorrow to see Ashley again
I know she&#39;s not waiting to see me as much
But what do I care
As long as it&#39;s fun to see her
I&#39;ll try to give her maybe a way to contact me
See what you say
This is what else?
Do not know
I have been full time not working on the project
Maybe I can work with a news company on my specific idea
That can be cool
Okay
What else?
I also have the interest of finding people to live with me
And the matter of couple therapy
And at work I&#39;m a little stuck too
In the end I did not make a plan for the week
But in Gaza I have 3.5 days to do 5 things
As long as I&#39;ve enough everything in half a day will be fine
Do not know if I will suffice
But I will try
Also not really I have 3.5 days
Because there are a lot of meetings
And Ashley
But in a small way
This
What more
Do not know
What more?
In the end I did not take a day off this week
Next Week
Okay
What more
This seems to me
Okay
What&#39;s up?
I need to talk to Ja here
And also with Mikel
Although too much time has passed
Good
What more?
This is I know?
Feel like talking about something?
Do not know
I thought to myself why the US is the country with the most immigrants
Why everyone wants to come here
What happens if I do regression surgery by per capita income
Is this the deciding factor?
Can also be a language
And also ease of migration
Why is this interesting to me?
Because it&#39;s like supply and demand
I wonder why there is so much demand
Maybe the amount of work
If you look at the percentages, there are not that many true immigrants here
But is this the right look?
Of course it also matters
A larger country can absorb more immigration without affecting its culture
This
What more?
There was the analysis I did about the optimal attraction rate in retirement
I have found that it is possible to reach 6 percent if you are willing to live on half of it in difficult years
6 It&#39;s not enough
6% is 60 thousand, the tax is about 10% let&#39;s say (it depends on the level of income and it is between 2% if I do not earn anything to 20% if we earn let&#39;s say 100000)
So in total you have to earn about 80 thousand
80 thousand is 6% of about 1.3 million
That it&#39;s another year or two of work
It&#39;s a basa
I hope to raise this number
But it&#39;s hard to know
okay, well
Hopefully the other investments are working
we will see what will be
What more?
Ummm
My head is pretty empty
He was full of pain
As well as a past weekend
Don&#39;t know what&#39;s up with these headaches on weekends
Maybe it&#39;s a pressure release from this week
But do not know
It&#39;s not like I&#39;m so stressed out this week
So hard to say

Off a bit I feel like just cutting and being with a different whore every week
To travel every weekend to Mexico or something
Maybe it will happen
Do not know
I feel wrong with Sheeran doing this to her
But what about me?
I also need to feel fine with me
Maybe I should take a break from it?
Maybe
I do not know if I can just come and tell her such a thing out of nowhere
Oops
I do not know what to do
