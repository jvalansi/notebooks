For another seven years, with the help of the name, I will be free from work
Although I will not be free from family,
But at least I will have ten hours a day five days a week to do what I want
What do I want?
Do not know
Will probably change
I am currently working on this qr
That might release me before the end of the seven years
Although such a project is supposed to take an order of magnitude of several years
So if you already have a project, why not something that interests me
Suppose language processing
The end goal is that a computer can understand speech
Pass a Turing test
But what is it to understand?
To have a representation of what it is
Let him have a model of what is said
That can turn text into a three-dimensional model
But what about abstract ideas?
How to imagine &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;what is the situation&quot;
How do children learn to speak?
At first they speak gibberish
Then slowly they wait for what others are saying
״אבא״ ״אמא״

When learning a language, what are the first words?
The most common words
But when learning a language, we already have a representation of things in mind
Maybe you can learn everything from movies?
Subtitles is the language
What about movies for kids

Need to test a machine that uses the principle of &quot;shooters connected together&quot;

I may have more insights after the course
