Hey whats up?
Sabba
Sunday back to work
A short week
Also next week
It&#39;s nice
Not that I have too many plans
okay, well
What are the options?
Do not know
I still do not feel anything
We&#39;ll see what the doctor says
What else?
Not too much
I did c2c today with two girls who did not flatter me
Maybe I should get a haircut
Maybe it&#39;s the mood
Do not know
On Tuesday I actually received a compliment
But Latin
Russians a little less flattering
Less emotion shows
okay, well
What about a stripper?
I have the week to order one
I can really bring that one up
I can
Good
What else?
Not too much
Sheeran extended in a few days
does not bother me
Maybe a little because it&#39;s just another proof that she prefers her parents over me
Mostly her dad
That I must point out that I do not particularly like
And it&#39;s a little stressful for me that she&#39;s like him
what can we do
Financial agreementâ€¦
okay, well
What else?
I talked to Sela a bit
Do not know what he has
Did not cooperate too much
Do not know what the point
As if he&#39;s saying he&#39;s kicking me but not acting like that
Sabba
Not critical
I&#39;m a little upset that I&#39;m not going on vacation with Jonathan&#39;s girlfriend
Maybe they&#39;re people around
I need to expand the circle
What it needs
Need nothing
Corona too and that
But just might be nice if I have someone to talk to
I tried to see if I had anything to talk about in Reddit
But I did not find too much there
What will I also talk about
I have no problem talking to myself
Like I thought I was talking about philosophy
But in essence, I can just &quot;talk&quot; about it with Google
I do not have any topic that interests me at the moment
My energy level is pretty low
Hope I&#39;m not sick of something
And if so it is reversible
okay, well
We will wait for the doctor
What else?
That&#39;s it, please
I do not have too much
Want to meditate?
okay, well
What will I do when Sheeran is here?
Maybe meditation with Um
If she hears out loud, so do I.
