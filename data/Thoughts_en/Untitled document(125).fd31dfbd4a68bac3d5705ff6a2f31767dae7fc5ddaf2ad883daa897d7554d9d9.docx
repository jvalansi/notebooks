what am I doing now
Another attempt to predict the market did not work
I can keep digging into it
At 20% I am free for less than a year and a half. 61 month (5 years) per million
The market makes 7%
At 15% it will take 28 months, less than 2.5 years. 70 month (6 years) per million
At 10% it will take 55 months, 4.5 years. 84 month (7 years) per million
At 7% it will take me 85 months, 7 years. 85 month (7 years) per million
Right now because Apple is doing well, I&#39;m about 11% on average
But nothing is certain
Need to see what happens to the house

The question of whether to spend time to rise from 7%
The truth is I do not even know if it is 7%
Besides that there is also inflation
So 7% is actually 5%

By and large a million should suffice

I can try to predict real estate

Any information available on the Internet is probably already utilized, and the price should reflect it

So by and large if I do nothing I reach a million in 7 years
And if I do something I get to a million in 5 years at best.
So maybe it&#39;s better to just let time do its thing
I have already invested a few years without moving forward
It does not say too much about the future, but there is definitely a situation where I will invest two years and nothing will come of it

On the other hand it interests me
What&#39;s up with the market
Why businesses are successful
How this world works
What affects business

Good 7 years, when I&#39;m 41â€¦ It&#39;s not terrible
This is a year above what I thought
Although technically at 40 I can retire
The question is what do I do over time
