Okay
So in the beginning there was agriculture
This evacuated part of the population, probably the elderly, to non-survival occupations
So what did they do? Invent the painting, from there the writing, from there maybe the story
These stories united cultures
In short all the writing comes from the same place
All languages come from roughly the same sources
Probably because there were few centers
It was better for each group to learn the language of the group stronger than it (with which it may trade)
The centers began near rivers
do not know how
Abraham came from the Euphrates region and the Tigris came to Canaan and then went to Egypt
Literally moved between empires
But they had been there before
How did they start?
There may have been hunter-gatherers who used the hunting tools to take over agricultural villages

So for example in the Bible there was Abraham Yitzchak Yaakov / Israel his 12 sons, who became tribes, and Yosef who went down to Egypt
After a few generations there was Moses, who brought the children of Israel out of Egypt
It&#39;s just families that grew up really, that&#39;s how it sounds
And the father of the family was a kind of ruler
In the Bible the prophet is the one who chose King Saul and then David
The story unites everyone who believes in it

Then the kingdom passes between the firstborn
