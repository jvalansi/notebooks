Perhaps words from the open group are vectors, and from the closed group matrices
Then a sentence like: life in the trash
Is basically:
Life
This is a function on the word life
Creates a vector
In this function on garbage
Creates a vector
Actually b
Works on both parts of the sentence
How does a matrix describe a function that receives more than one argument?
Maybe every word is a matrix
What gets a vector and returns a matrix?
