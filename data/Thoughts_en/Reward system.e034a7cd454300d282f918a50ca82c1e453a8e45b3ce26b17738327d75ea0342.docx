There are two signals:
Change (dopamine)
Sign (positive or negative) (opioid)

What is a positive sign? Lack of negative sign
In fact we constantly owe a negative sign that our nerves are constantly firing, either from sitting on a chair, or lying in bed.
Once we are relieved by these signs, a kind of numbness we feel &quot;good&quot;.

According to this, when we are confident in the bathroom that we feel nothing, we are supposed to feel better than in sex.
Maybe because in the bath we only lose sensation in the outer cells but not in the inner cells.

According to this under general anesthesia we are supposed to feel best.
Maybe because under anesthesia we also numb the area that feels (which receives this input)

According to this if we find anesthesia the whole body and not the brain we will feel best.
Maybe because inside the brain is the mechanism that constantly fires that simulates a negative feeling and it does not stop firing even when the body is asleep.

So if we find a way to silence him we can feel good all the time.
By and large this is what opioids do, but they create dependency.
Maybe dependence is just an outgrowth of a good feeling over time.
Maybe because you have to change all the time.

So the mechanism is just negative, why do living things not commit suicide?
Because apparently death hurts. Everything that brings us closer to death, hurts us, and it teaches us that death probably hurts.

All in all, we are trying to minimize the pain in our lives.
The problem is that the mechanism works in pulses, so to minimize pain we can only create pulses of &quot;joy&quot; (lack of pain)
