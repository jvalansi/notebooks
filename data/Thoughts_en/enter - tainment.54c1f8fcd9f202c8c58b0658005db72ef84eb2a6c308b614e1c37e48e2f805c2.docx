I do not know what the point of entertainment?
Why do I want entertainment?
What is entertainment?
Entertainment - an event or action that provides interest or joy to the audience
Must be positive, is a sad movie not entertaining?
Must there be an audience?
When I play football, am I entertained?
Can there be one person entertained? of course
And that&#39;s why I&#39;m looking for entertainment, I&#39;m looking for a positive feeling
I&#39;m looking for interest
I&#39;m looking for joy
What interests me
What makes me happy?
Why did I see Gollstar?
Because it&#39;s funny
What makes me funny?
Why am I laughing?
Let&#39;s check out 9gag posts that made me laugh
A new and surprising relationship that I did not think of
insight
But not every new relationship or insight is funny,
For example if I&#39;m learning something new, I do not respond with a laugh,
Suppose I had an insight about the fact that entertainment is linked to a positive feeling so I&#39;m looking for it, it did not make me laugh
What is the difference between discovering that entertainment is linked to a positive feeling and discovering the connection between 2pac and Chubka - 2pacca
The other is a funny link - because it&#39;s surprising, I did not expect it, I did not look for it, I respond to surprise
But not everything that is surprising, funny, why 2pacca funny?
Why find that I forgot my wallet is not funny even that it is surprising
It&#39;s good that it&#39;s not funny to me, but it&#39;s funny to those around me,
Because the effect of this on me is negative,
But if there hadn’t been a negative impact, it wouldn’t have been that interesting, I still wouldn’t have laughed
Maybe there must be someone who is negatively affected by this relationship for me to be positively affected and laugh
Like for example that 2 pac would probably have been offended by this connection, or Chubka, I&#39;m not sure
Or maybe the laughter is out of embarrassment ...
