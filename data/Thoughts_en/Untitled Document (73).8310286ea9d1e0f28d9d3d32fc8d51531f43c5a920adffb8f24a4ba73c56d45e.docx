The smoking yesterday gave me nothing
Maybe I&#39;m done?
So what now?
Good question
No smoking at all?
interesting
What other options are there?
Adibles?
I&#39;ll probably try Adibles next month

Why do I have to think all the time?
Because it&#39;s boring for me not to think about anything
That&#39;s the point
I need to get bored
Not thinking about anything
It&#39;s meditation
