So what do you say?
Not too much
We walked a bit this week
it was really nice
We saw full of landscapes!
We drove full
We were a bit of a bogas
We were also in the fancy section, from the credit card
Dude, we met Dekel
Sheeran seems to be in a tension with her boyfriend
There is a situation she wants me :)
Well what else?
Not too much
I looked at real estate opportunities
The majority do not look too crazy
I need to look at how much dividend is guaranteed versus how much it costs
That&#39;s all there is to it
in anything
It&#39;s price versus value
For them, the consideration is the final price, how much it will sell
Plus how much dividend you get at any given moment
But in the end the final price is supposed to embody the profit
So it comes down to cost versus final dividend or selling price
I can analyze companies like this in a nutshell
Then what&#39;s the difference actually…
I can try all the options and see what works…

I can start looking at opportunities for startups
Then maybe if he comes to make one myself
The problem is that startups often fail
So do not know if I want to put 50 thousand on something that probably will not work
The question is how good am I at knowing what will work
It&#39;s an option
I can do a simulation and see how much I would earn
interesting
Train myself to predict what will succeed
It would have been better to train a neural network…
But even doing it myself I was happy

It&#39;s an option
I would have been happy to finish earlier with real estate syndicates

what else?
How&#39;s life?
Walla there are not many complaints in total
Boring
maybe a little
What to do?
hobby
What hobby?
what do you want?
Do not know…
I was happy to know how to build websites it seems to me
Build things in code
I might have written from Jupiter&#39;s companies
Then publish them somewhere

like what?
Suppose faceswap as a service?
Suppose…
How do you do that?
Impossible with notebook
It is possible with what was recommended in fastai
By and large do not know if you need too much
Need to upload video and photo
And get video
This
By and large this is the interface of any web page
What give
What do you get
What is the signature of the page
Good
I get a little tangled up with the time to wait
Like how does it work?
I&#39;m sending a movie and a picture
The server is producing a movie
The server uploads the movie as output
Can also give a link to YouTube

Good
What else?
Not too much
Tomorrow is the last day off
Sunday
Then I have two weeks and then I fly…

So how does real estate work
What makes it such a good tool for money?

Some put aside to reach a million
100000=s(x+x^2+...+x^n)=s*(x^(n+1)-x)/(1-x)
log(10^6)=log(x^(n+1)-x)-log(1-x)

1000=(x^n-1)/(x-1)
8=x^n
log (8) = nlog (1.008)

83 = (x ^ nx) / (x-1)
8.3=x^n
ln (8) * 10 = n
2*10=n

So it takes twenty years and a thousand dollars a month…
It&#39;s not so bad
It&#39;s even a spin
And that&#39;s if he manages to make 10%
If he manages to make 20%, it&#39;s only ten years
