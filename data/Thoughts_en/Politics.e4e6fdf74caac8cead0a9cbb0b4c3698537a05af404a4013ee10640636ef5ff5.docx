I do not know what to do with the game
On the one hand I want something to be a simulation of the real world
And on the other hand I want something playful
One more important
I can divide the government as seen in the OECD
Defense - Military
פנים - policing, emergency management, national security, supervision of local governments, conduct of elections, public administration and immigration matter
Foreign - Diplomacy
Culture -
Education
health
אוצר - of government finance, fiscal policy, and financial regulation

And what does everyone do?
 
Maybe it&#39;s better to start from the bottom
The daily life of an individual
Like The Sims
But more real
I know on average how much is invested in each area
