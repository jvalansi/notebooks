I want to break free!
I’m obsessed.
Not sure what to do about it
I need to get to 50k to be free
That should happen in ±4 years (end of 2022)
I want to get to 75k to keep growing
That’s 2 years later, and it makes my income grow
It’s not a lot
It depends on me being able to get 10%
Let’s see what happens with the real estate deal…
Either way, it’s ½ a million, it should be enough, as one provider.
4 years…
That’s fine I guess…
Why do I keep working on the investment thing?
Well 20% can get me there twice as fast.

I’ll be 40 in about 6 years…
40 is kinda old
And what did I do?
I wish I was working on language…
That’s the important stuff
I want to contribute my share.
I should go study, do some research…

4 years
200 weeks
Well the army took 4 years
It passed fairly quickly
The degree took more than 4 years…
A lot happened though…
Ammm
I’m getting ~12 days a year, that’s 2.5 weeks.
I need to take a vacation twice a year.
2 weeks, 10 days.
Break it down.
In Christmas I have a week, and usually thanksgiving too.
So the other weeks should be as far as possible from that.
That means April and August.
Right now I have 10 days, 2 weeks

But what do I do on that week?

What do I do in my spare time?
I don’t know 

I just want to not have to do anything…
And do what I feel like
But what do I feel like doing?
No clue…
Man
I’m empty

There was this thing, where I gathered all of the national accounts info…
Might be interesting to see how countries split their investments as well as companies.
It would be interesting to simulate that.
That’s pretty much what I’m doing in the prediction thing.
Something like civilization, but without the graphics.
Is there a way to answer a moral question objectively?
Is there absolute moral?
I guess there isn’t but stuff can be voted, according to the sum of collective morals.
One can do that by doing online votes…
