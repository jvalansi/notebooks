good so
I need to find an investment
For that I need to analyze something like 100 trades
I narrowed down the options to Florida and California
These are two places I would love to visit / live in
Florida has the advantage of having more opportunities
I live in California, so I can literally walk around and visit here

I can write some tool that will analyze all the transactions that the guy from Florida sent me
I can update it to check deals in California

I should also add information on schools and crime

Well then I have an apartment that looks rotten on paper
I might make an offer for her
What other steps are there on the way
I will post in the forum about the deal
I should maybe do some tests in California at the same time

I need to understand a little more about the process of funding
I&#39;m a little upset that I brought them the social before I found out
