2 types of happiness
Momentary and continual.
Momentary like eating or sex or drugs, where doing more of it, just makes you want to do it more. If you starve it you’re full and if you fill it you starve.
Continual happiness comes from being present, from being in a state of flow, where you are fully immersed in the experience you’re having.
To be in a state of flow you need 2 things:
A task that is interesting and challenging in the right amount
Skills that are high enough for the task.
