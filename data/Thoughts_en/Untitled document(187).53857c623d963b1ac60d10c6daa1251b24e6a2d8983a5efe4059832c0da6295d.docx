The engineering average must be done, because in the end the result is the product of the values
But what is equivalent for a standard deviation
If you replace an amount by multiplying by multiplying by a fraction
So for standard deviation:
std(x) = (sum((x_i-e(x))^2))^1/2
std+(x) = (mult(x_i/e(x)^^2))^^Â½
What is it ^^
If * it is a strong product it is **

Multiplication is ++

Multiplying x by y is to add x to itself y times
Raising x to the power of y is to multiply the x itself y times
Raise x to double the power of y is to raise x to the power of y twice
But what is it to multiply by a fraction?
What does it cost to raise a fraction?

It might just be better to do the accounts on the log of the percentage changes
