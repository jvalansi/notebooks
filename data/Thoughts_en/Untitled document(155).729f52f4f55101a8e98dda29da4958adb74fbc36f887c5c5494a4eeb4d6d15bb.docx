How do I make the most out of today?
What do I want to accomplish?
I don’t know
If you don’t know where you want to go, it doesn’t matter which direction you take.

I build this, put 30k, get 300
I move on to duplex, 50k, get 500
I need 10 of those.
Can I do 2 each year?

50k should get me 500 a month
I should be getting 1500 right now
2000 next year - 24k a year
2500 the year after - 30k a year
3500 the year after that - 36k
4000 the year after that - 42k
