This is actually a segment that Sheeran keeps in touch with Ex
She&#39;s never been around with me staying in touch with an ex
no chance…
Tachles has a situation where they just had to stay
I just got into a situation…
As if it does not bother me
A bit disturbing obviously
Because a girl who keeps in touch with X, there&#39;s probably something there
Man what does he care to keep in touch with exes…
And more than that, she is also the one who addresses him…
ססעמק
Annoying
As if for me you would go with him
I&#39;ll get freedom
Just harassing the ego
That she prefers it
segment
I do not have too much to do
It&#39;s her decision
I&#39;m not going to decide for her what to do
Like I&#39;m not expecting her to tell me what to do
Fulfilled if I could I also keep in touch with exes
But I have no one
I would show her what it looked like from the side
Maybe this is why there is monogamy?
Once upon a time when we lived in small communities, Exim was really personal
You could not just say goodbye and that&#39;s it
You&#39;ll still see the man forever
Look who they are with now
And they will see you
You will always be there, and they will always be there
So monogamy is a bit of a hindrance to the situation
What a long word for something simple
Maybe an event, or a situation is better

Well do not know
I have nothing to think about
