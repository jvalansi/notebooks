Hey
what&#39;s going on?
All is well
What about you?
Sabba
So what kind of project was done?
There are several options
Current functionality of morphine - talk to corenl
Data Detectors
Active Lerning
Body Change - &quot;Tell Mom I Love Her&quot;
Okay
What else?
What about Ashley Elizabeth
Oops she does not answer
It seems to me this is it
It&#39;s over
Oops
What about a psychologist?
What about Ivska?
What about drugs?
Do not know
Where to begin?
What about the house
Semc
What an unnecessary house
so what are we doing?
I can sell it
But it&#39;s work, too
Maybe over time it becomes less work
Maybe
What more?
The project
Do not know
It&#39;s at work too
Do not know need to see if anyone can help me
I would be really happy if anyone could help there
What else?
Do I want another project?
I tried to understand how the capital market is related to the national product
There is a connection
Basically you can count a product in several ways
product
Final product - intermediate product
+ Exported product - imported
income
Private income (salary)
Profits (incorporated or not)
Income from taxes
expenditure
Private expenditure
investment
Public investment
Import balance
So overall if you look at the income of the companies, the profits, it should be related to the capital market
When companies make a lot of profits, and people make a lot, the product also grows
The question is whether this is what matters
Let&#39;s see if that makes sense
as per:
Private income was about 11.5 trillion
The profits are about 2.5 trillion
At s &amp; p 500 the p / e is 30, and the market cap is 30 trillion
Which means the profits are about a trillion
That it makes sense that they make up about half of all profits
interesting
The CRSP US Total Market Index is currently at $ 2500
His pe also around the 30s
The eps around the 80s
pe = marketCap/earnings=price/eps
EPS = earnings/shares
30 ~= 2500/80
did not help
Maybe the russel 3000
The truth is that its market cap is also around 30 trillion
mozar
Good
But quite logically, there is a situation where the other half of the money is private
There is a situation
Good
What else?
Do not know
What do you want to know?
What about the more important part, private income
There are 150 million employees here
They bring in an average of 50,000 a year
That comes out to 7.5 trillion
That pretty much gets along with a private income of 11.5 trillion
Although 4 trillion have disappeared here which is a lot of money
But it&#39;s an order of magnitude
Okay so the rest is public pay 1.5t and employer contributions 2t

Good
What do I do with all job offers?
On the one hand I want to practice
On the other hand I have no power over it
so what are we doing?
Maybe
I do not know what to do
Good
What more
Maybe I should pick a company or two and give it a try
Maybe just try Google
What to say to others?
If Google does not work, will I switch?
Do not know
where?
If the company interests me then why not
If it&#39;s not interesting then no

What about the books?
Maybe I should start reading
Maybe I should start with the second book he recommended to me
Maybe
Good
What else?
Maybe I&#39;ll just listen
Maybe
What else?
is nothing
enough
