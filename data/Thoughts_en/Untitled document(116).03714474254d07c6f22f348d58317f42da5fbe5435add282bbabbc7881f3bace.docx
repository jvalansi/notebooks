Shut up
I need some vipassana time 
No talking, no people , no input, no output, just idle processing time…
I’d rent a car and live in the car.
How do I get food?
Order in the app
Or I can go in mcdonalds, order through the machine, and take out
But then do I have the cellphone open?
No, just to order…

I then drive to Tijouana

When is that happening?
Could have happened in Memorial day…
Probably I’ll have to wait…
July 4th?
Probably a lot of work…

Can I have AL + JNI + transliteration done by then?
How far is it? 2 months…
That’s not a lot…
Goal - have JNI in production. AL in production. Transliteration in production.
We need to have some performance testing in place.



Now what?

What to do?
Nothing… Just waste the rest of your life…
I that it?
Damn.

I want more…
But what?
Money?
Experiences?
Like what?
I can’t do anything like south america again. I’m pretty old for that.
I can’t have all that sex and love games.
That’s pretty sad…

So what can I do?
Hookers and drugs…
