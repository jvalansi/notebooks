Is there such a thing as too politically correct
If I can not start with a girl, because as soon as she tells me no, I must stop
In general it is politically correct to lie
It does not say what you really think so as not to offend
I&#39;m in favor of lying a bit
I prefer this mask of the Californians with a fake smile over the default face of the Parisians
But is there a limit from which this is already a problem?
Maybe make meaningful connections
As if the big truth is I&#39;m in favor of it
