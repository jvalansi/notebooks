How do I not waste my life…
What’s wasting life?
Just doing nothing
But that’s meditation, no?
Not exactly. Meditation probably involves inner examination or something…
Actually in meditation I’m supposed to not think of anything, so it’s actually exactly doing nothing.
And it’s actually harder than doing something, like playing video games or watching tv.
So is watching tv or playing video games wasting time?
Wasting is misusing, or not using something useful.
Time is useful, because it can be used.
So is watching tv and playing video games not useful?
If it brings joy, it’s probably not so bad.
I guess it’s about looking back and saying that was useful.
If I watch tv, after that’s over I look back, how do I feel.
So maybe I should say it’s not satisfying.
What is satisfaction?
I guess in general satisfaction is reaching a threshold.
Commonly meant for reaching a threshold of one’s expectation.
So if I’m not expecting to get anything, there’s not threshold and anything I do is satisfying.
But is that the case? Can I not expect anything? It’s like just waiting to die.
What’s missing? What do I expect?
Good question.
What’s my biggest problem?
Lack of freedom. Everyday I have to go to work. I can’t have sex with other women.
So do I expect to solve that? Would that satisfy me?
For work I can just save enough money that it generate enough to sustain half a family, probably around 500k. It’s going to take ±6 years from now…
What do I do with the women part?
I can do that behind the back or I can get a divorce?
I can just walk the border and go to strip clubs…
That’s not complete freedom, but being single might also not be complete freedom.
THere’s no such thing as complete freedom.
I’ll cross that bridge I guess.

If I want to use my time right I need to move further to being free. The problem is that many times that’s not fun. And then I’m wasting time I could use for fun.
So what’s more important freedom or fun?
I guess both are. That’s why I’m dividing my free time in 2, one part for fun (3/21 parts of the week) and one part for work (4/21 parts of the week)
So for fun I should only care about fun, not satisfaction. If that’s the case I should go to strippers. 

The problem is that it’s expensive. It’s ±200$ each time.
Looks like video games is the next best, but it’s a bit more expensive, so then there’s tv, they are pretty much tied.

What else?
