So maybe invest in gamification
Maybe reading financial reports
Cannes academic
It was cool to invest in something that turns a book into a course
Maybe just messing with the things of the job
This week I did not have time because of the full tasks
Need to arrange the work arrangement
Week to create drafts
A week to do a review
I want to have to give it only one day a week
What makes a book a course is amazing
It is also possible to use computational learning
Can also be used to teach the machine
In short, everything I do is for the better
The idea to do something I love
The hardest question is what I like

What about politics
There are full economic studies
Is it possible to put learning here
Produce an economic model through computational learning?

If I can predict countries&#39; improvement from information, it may be possible to use it to manage countries as well
There are full of beautiful things
Full of projects
I would love to have all of these projects accessible
That I can contribute when I have an idea
The same should be done with the model of the second law
Not simple but also possible in code
It is possible with square bodies because it is probably easier
Although traffic is restricted to very specific directions
How can you really move diagonally in a digital world?
Is there a minimum angle?
Quantization of motion
Large bodies have infinite ability to move
But minimal bodies can only move on one diagonal, apart from the usual directions
Wait a minute if there is a tunnel, maybe there is no limit
Let&#39;s try this digital world
If there are problems we will talk about them

I need to write it all down in an honest project
I need to analyze what I am recording somehow
Most things can be divided by type
I need to do a classification for the sentences I write
Each sentence has a role
Perhaps any sentence can be made to take action
There are todo sentences
There are knowledge theorems
and so
It may be possible to divide the documents into types
Maybe inside you can divide the sentences
