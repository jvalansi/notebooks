So
Again
6 years
I need ±600k
This should get me 60k a year
From which I should get 48k or 4k a month
If I want 5k like I spend right now, I should have 800k and take 80k
This is given I am making 10% on my investment
Might have to save for 2 more years to get to 1M
Right now looks like I can make it to 600k in 5 years, 700k in 6, 850 in 7 and 1M in 8
But I think I’ll retire in 5, and then take a year off or something to see how that is.
I think after retiring I’ll still make money, because I’ll be productive
So it’s a bit less than 5 years, 4 and 8 months right now until I’m 29
So in 6 months it’s be 50m away, which is approx 100 paychecks = 200w ~= 4 years
That’s not too bad
I’m getting 40k a year (before taxes) from the bonus, meaning around 26k net, and then 18k from 401k, and 11.5% ~= 14.5k before tax which is 10k net from espp, total of 54k saving
133k+40k=173k, 
Tax ~50k, saving ~54k, spending 70? I’m probably spending a bit more than 60, so saving is maybe 1k more (last year I earned ~150k, so i didn’t save that 10k, but maybe this year)
