So what does rock mean?
There is no free choice
It does not matter that there is an illusion of choice
We are made of shields
And water
Our values stem from our genes and memes
We&#39;re like Hamlet talking about Shakespeare
We are not capable
Because we are cement
We are characters in the story
We can not talk meta

In my opinion and more how is it possible
We may be limited in our brain capacity
But I think in principle, our ability to calculate is unlimited
In principle, infinite computing power can solve any problem
Except for the stopping problem, I guess
We are of course limited to our brain
But as a collective, we are limited to the language we speak
And it may not be limited
And anyway we can create a computer with infinite computing power
Well he will probably be final
Can we eventually produce a computer that can predict all the events?
First of all it is limited in the amount of makeup it has
Because information advances at the speed of light

In fact, maybe that&#39;s not the question
The conclusion of the book is that nothing matters
Just as God is an illusion
Happiness is also an illusion
It&#39;s an abstract noun we invented
Nothing matters objectively
It makes sense that importance or value is a subjective thing

I tend to disagree
That nothing matters
There are things that are subjectively important (obviously)
Like food or sex

I agree that nothing is objectively important
By and large this is from the definition of important
Important is something we give high value to
Without us nothing matters or does not matter
Okay
But we exist
There is a subject
And I have what is important and not important to me
And if it&#39;s important to me to be happy
So that&#39;s what&#39;s important to me

Society is also an organism
So it is important for her to survive
So it is important for society not to fade
And not to get into chaos
The idea is to reach equilibrium I guess
To a steady state

We are largely animals
So with food and sex we were supposed to have a spin
But we have more than that
We have boredom
We need to dispel it all the time

We are not the programmers
We are the program
And therefore we can not understand ourselves

I do not agree with the claim
Is it impossible to write a program that will understand its own code?
