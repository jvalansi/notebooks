I do not feel the desire to learn
I want to want to study but am afraid I want to do it not for myself but for the culture, because I am actually a small screw in it, and it forces me to go its own way
Come on what comes to mind today I sat like many last days like a zombie, yesterday I read a whole book, and not an easy book, about the genes why because it interested me I had a question I wanted to answer, or the concept of selfish gene explained me a lot mainly I remember interested me about Memes, why because I try to understand what attracts in learning what sets us apart from the rest and in my opinion the answer to this matter is the concept &quot;concept&quot;, the idea or maybe actually the concept is an idea what is a concept, I got it and now it is in my head or at least has its representation In my head how they came up with the idea of evolution if you still do not know what exactly life is, how do you know physics if no one has a clear idea what matter is, it is the idea once you have an idea in your head you can explore it and break it down into components but why Not build? It&#39;s order, it&#39;s the idea of order they say that awareness is the ability to arrange things to reduce entropy, where did the concept of number come from, it&#39;s a very common feature, there used to be people with a lot of sheep and wanted to know who has more sheep. If they are three and we two have a better chance of overcoming us, maybe that&#39;s where the idea of a number came from or if we grew so and so grain and everyone needed so and so, then the grain will suffice for this and so time, number is a generalization of quantity, which is a concept in itself there are tribes That they have one my heart concept two and a lot, and that&#39;s it their math, with that more than two it&#39;s a lot, the theory of logic which itself investigates the truths of indications about concepts once you try to formulate a rule to make order, you can test it by your assumptions Assumptions but concepts
