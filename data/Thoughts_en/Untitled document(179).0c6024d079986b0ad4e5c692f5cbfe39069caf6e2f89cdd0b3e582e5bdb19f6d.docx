All we need for an agreement:
a de-militarized Palestinian state, 
an Israeli withdrawal to the Green Line with equal territorial exchange, 
a family unification in Israel of 100,000 Palestinian refugees, 
West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine, 
the Jewish Quarter and the Western Wall under Israeli sovereignty and the Muslim and Christian quarters and the al Haram al Sharif/Temple Mount under Palestinian sovereignty, 
and the end of the conflict and claims
the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state, including the historic and religious ties to the land
Israel recognized the Arab and Muslim character of the Palestinian state
