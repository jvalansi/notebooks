So in a year I get 165k
I work ±250 days (~365/7*5)
So every day I bring home 165k/250~=660$
Every hour (i work ~8 hours)  is ~80$
A third goes to taxes so more like 440$, or ~60$ an hour, or ~1$ a minute…
I save half let’s say, so 220 a day, or 55k a year

Every month I spend ~5k, or ~166 a day, or ~230 if I only count week days (*7/5)
100 for housing
25 for food
10 for travel
5 for shopping
5 for entertainment
4 for bills
3 for health
