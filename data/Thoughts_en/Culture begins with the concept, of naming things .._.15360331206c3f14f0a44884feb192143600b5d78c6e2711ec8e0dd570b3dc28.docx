Culture begins with the concept,
By naming things, so that we can contain them in our imagination

When we gave a concept for the good feeling, when we invented the concept &quot;good&quot; and therefore also &quot;bad&quot;, here we set the goal of culture, the goal of course is to avoid &quot;bad&quot; and as much as possible &quot;good&quot;
Joy and Ozer are just words that describe a good feeling
Love is a good feeling when its object is external

But basically what is a good feeling, it is impossible to define a concept in the concept itself, so a good feeling is actually a feeling that we would like to exist all the time, that is, its very existence we want to maximize,
This feeling is an interpretation of the senses, the senses perceive and so we feel, although there is also a feeling in the brain, I mean love is not exactly received in the senses, but it is an interpretation, so it goes into definition, it is just a meta interpretation, so when our senses, I find it difficult to say It limits them, but basically when the interpretation is positive we feel good,
When is the interpretation positive? If we look at the genes, then the interpretation is positive when at the moment the gene has a better chance of surviving, i.e. after we have eaten enough, after we have fucked,
But why does beauty make us feel good, what does it provide, why is symmetry or simplicity considered beautiful?
It seems to me that language once again enters the &quot;concept&quot; of interest, when as few concepts as possible describe as much of the world as possible, it&#39;s beautiful, maybe, it gives a good feeling maybe
There is the benefit of predicting the future through concepts, which actually increases our confidence so our genes are supposed to make us feel good about it

After all, animals have sex not to survive but because it feels good, which means they instinctively prevent it,

There is a very good chance that before the concept of good existed there was already the concept of bad, because bad is the generalization of our passions, hunger thirsts horny, not that they themselves are bad but they make us feel bad, when I am hungry then it bothers me until I satisfy myself, When I&#39;m horny it bothers me until I satisfy this hunger, the same with breathing, we only feel when the need is not met, I&#39;m not sure sex feels as good as it feels bad without it, although it seems to me that sex is a bit unusual in this respect because it does not feel good to breathe , Or drinking just hurts us when not, and pain is the motive, maybe the strongest as he said in the lecture to the lecturer there is nothing that motivates more than the hanging rope or something like that, even sleep, maybe there are those who do it for fun, but usually it is done out of lack of choice
It seems to me that what pain just does is overload the brain, the brain is not free to deal with other things because its attention is committed to the painful area, sometimes one pain is also harmless but accumulation can even kill pain, which is a very strange expression because what is the thing if the thing hurts You do not kill yourself, so the pain that is supposed to deter you from the painful thing in order for you to survive actually does the opposite and suddenly kills you.

Humor is a very social thing, it&#39;s just an example of creativity, of dishonest thinking, and the appreciation for it is laughter, like for example Mark&#39;s imitation, was an exaggeration, meaning I presented it in an unconventional way,
