What to do?
I have full of things to do
There are reminders
There&#39;s asana
I have a matrix of options in Excel here
I have here on the side the tasks of Google
I have the assignments I wrote down for myself at the beginning of the year

What do I want to do?
Do not know…
If I can do what I want
what am I doing
I have a billion dollars
whip
Do not know
Why is it so hard…

First thing to unify lists

But where?
Most convenient are Apple reminders
But this is not a cross-platform
I once did this test
Still not closed on what to choose…
