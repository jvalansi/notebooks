intelligence
The whole brain thinks the same way, in patterns of time space, all the senses simply perceive changes in the environment and transmit them through the nerves, if it is light, then there is a nerve that perceives if there is more or less light, if it is a sound then there is a nerve that perceives the frequency of the sound, if It&#39;s the amount of food in the stomach that affects hunger, it&#39;s all patterns of changes in space and time, and patterns linked to each other, cat input will be characterized by pointed ears, &quot;meow&quot; sound and even without feeling it we will know its fur is pleasant to caress, but the basis of all is patterns of changes in space Time, there is always a transfer of information (we often ignore, the changes are the ones that usually catch the attention
These patterns are stored in memory but in a special way,
The memory is preserved in a certain sequence, it is not possible to see an overall picture straight, it is only possible to remember in the process, like a song, a character, a detail, every time a concept
Memory completes patterns, it receives information and completes it on its own, according to the input
What matters in the resulting patterns, is not the exact input but the relationship between the inputs, when we identify a person, we not only recognize that he has eyes and nose, we also recognize the distance between the eyes Proportion, and even if we look at him from a different light we will notice it is the same person,
Intelligence is the predictive ability of the brain, the ability to self-complete the received pattern, the brain constantly completes patterns of its input, and tries to predict from past memory the continuation of the input, what it is supposed to absorb, meaningful thinking is obtained only when there is a deviation from the desired pattern. Humor is built, for example, as soon as we get out of the routine line of thought, surprise makes us laugh, as a kind of recognition of the excitement we experienced), in us memory also controls behavior, behavior is a result of our prediction of what is supposed to happen, first we imagine the action.
Cortex action

The cortex consists of six layers, which information runs up and down, it rises upwards, and sifts the treatment, in order to reach maximum analysis, and in addition it goes down in the form of feedback, to predict its expectation, completion of the current pattern, and thus checks itself, if anything new , If there is something to learn, or where the situation is clear and familiar, the ahmash can also descend down the locomotor regions of the cortex and thus order an action appropriate to the current pattern.
Each region in the cortex works in pretty much the same way, it recognizes the pattern in the current input and passes it on, while sifting through the less important details, for each pattern or series, a group of organs it retains or gives a name, which it passes on
The hierarchy in the cortex represents the world, logic is in fact induction and deduction, understanding the pattern, or the relationship between things, building a whole from parts, and deduction, separating the whole into its parts, understanding about an individual from the whole

In the lower layer, all the input comes directly from the receptors, the nerves, ie the senses, when there are inputs that often come together, they continue on together to the next layer, and a generalization is formed between them, the next time only some of the inputs are supposed to appear together, the cortex already knew to complete the picture. And every time these inputs appear again and again together, the connections are strengthened, and our predictive power increases, grouping inputs together is actually giving a name or conceptualization of a phenomenon, as for example connecting input of stem with leaves gives the concept of wood, or connection of sound tax gives the concept Tune, once the prediction is wrong, it is necessary to investigate the matter, break it down into components or look for different patterns
The action is part of thinking, it is simply continuing processing through the nerves related to the position of the body at any given moment, for example when in the corner of the eye we have a feeling of bone growing rapidly i.e. approaching, instinctively defending ourselves from this direction because we already know the pattern. Quickly, it will probably hurt, but even non-instinctive stunts work similarly
The Gestalt, the sense of reaching a conclusion stems from the moment when the appropriate pattern for the given input is found, when as in a puzzle everything settles in place
Learning is done so that at each stage the processing is done at the lower levels of the cortex, for example speech, first syllable separation is the main occupation of the cortex, then word separation, word imitation, sentence construction, etc., so in adulthood, syllable separation is done with almost input.
The short-term memory, the new memory, is in the hippocampus, when there is input that does not fit into any template, oh is stored in the hippocampus for immediate use, but if it is not needed, it will be lost as soon as such new information arrives
The thalamus receives the information that needs to be focused on at that moment

Intelligence is actually the ability to predict and remember and it has existed since the dawn of life, as the basic operation of the cell, which is separated from the outside, but receives information from it and uses it (for reproduction, for food ...)
The next step was the ability to change the predictive and memory abilities during life, which means that it is not only a genetic charge but is also affected by the environment.
The last ability is the ability to create concepts, or names as a substitute for direct learning, this is the mediation known to certain species of animals, but performed in a much stronger way in humans
Creativity is openness to patterns, meaning a repeated attempt to understand or challenge existing patterns, when we are not committed to the pattern, we do not work in stereotypes and are able to come up with a completely new approach to sustain
Awareness is actually the total declarative memories, conceptualized in us, that is, things we can talk about, if we erase a person&#39;s memory of a particular day, that is, return his mind to the exact state he was in the day before, then he will be sure that the past day did not exist at all. For he was unaware of his deeds the day before, though when he had done them he was fully aware of it,
Consciousness is the ability to concentrate or tune in to certain things, free will
Imagination is the patterns we create in our heads, even when there is no complete picture we are able to complete it in our imagination, and when we only think of a certain concept we are able to go into it in great detail as if it existed
