So I have to study for interviews
In an interview I did it turned out that I was less good at data science and math
I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m in math
But was there too much…
I need to do an academic Cannes of Statistics
But it&#39;s about 20 hours
And I have maybe 3 hours a day
I can do it in two weeks then…
Come on
Just need to finish with the apartment
