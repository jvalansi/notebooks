I should try to anticipate the outcome, make cases and reactions

I tried to give the free qr to 10 restaurants
Only 5 took
Only 1 really put it on the tables

I spend way too much money

I do not know how to proceed from here
I still believe in the idea
I can try to go to 100 places
So that 10 apply the qr
I can try to post on Facebook / Google
I need an ad
I need an explanatory video
But an explanatory video costs thousands of dollars
I do not know if I want to invest such a sum

For 100 restaurants I need 50 prints of ten qrs
It comes out to about $ 500-1000

I was happy to start writing it all in
