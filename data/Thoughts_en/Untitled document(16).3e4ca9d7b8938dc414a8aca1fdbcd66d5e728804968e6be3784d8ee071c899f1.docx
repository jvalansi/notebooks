Well then another 45 minutes of the interview
A little stressful
Maybe even quite stressful
All for the best
But I still feel the need to be good at the interview
I did what I could seem to me
I have the second code interviews now
I guess they will start in the medium and continue to harden
Bronze I just fail
But psychic yes
we will see what will be
The interviewer is a computational learner
Do not know if I know enoughâ€¦
hope so
Achach Aruchat
Brother System Design
Here too I do not know if I know enough
hope so
You have a behavioral interview
Hope it will be good
After all, after that the project is over
It takes me a long time
This way or that way
It was good, but a lot
About two months I prepared for it
It filled me with pretty much all of my free time
I analyzed how long I sat on everything last year but
Can&#39;t remember seeing it the truth
Maybe I have not written about it yet?
Maybe
But this year it will probably show up
January project
The next project is the idea of choosing the facilitator with the 95th highest percentage
This
What more
How about raising your brain to the cloud?
This is also important
But intelligence may need to be resolved first
Although not sure
This professor at Berkeley is doing a really interesting job
Maybe I should go to Berkeley
Maybe
But need to see what the neck bottle is
At the moment it seems to be the surgery to implant the sensors
The sensors are for reading only
But there is a situation where writing through the eye is good enough
Or by voice
It&#39;s like talking to yourself
So why not really put the sensors in your mouth or a little before
Do not know if it helps too much
