If I take a dictionary definition and try to predict the word, or vice versa
To get the correct representation of the word

I want to manage projects well

I centralize the money and make 6% annually

How do I insure the money?

The market rises by an average of 8% percent per year
But there could be a year where it drops by 50%

I want insurance for this year
That if the money falls by 50% I get the money back
How do you do that?
If I agree to commit to selling all my shares at the end of the year at their price + 7%?
Most years I will lose the difference (but I will still make 7%) but in the year of the fall I will not fall

I can pay 0.65% on the chance of falling 4/70 ~ = 5% in a third of a year
This year
1.0065^3=~2%
1.05^3=~16%
I mean I pay 2% so as not to fall more than 16%

In seven months the numbers are 0.9% on the chance of falling 10%
This year:
1.009^2=~1.8%
1.1^2=~21%


With the options, the expectation is:
8-2 = 6%
With the bonds:
8*¾+2.5*¼=6.6%
But the biggest fall with options will be 20%
And with bonds it can be 50 * ¾ = 37.5%
