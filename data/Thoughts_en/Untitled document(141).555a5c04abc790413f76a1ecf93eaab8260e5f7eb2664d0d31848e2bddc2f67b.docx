So what’s up
I did find some topics I’m most interested in:
Money
Real estate
Physics
Biology
Brain
Sociology
Politics
Computers
Machine learning
NLP

What now?
What do you want???
I don’t fucking know
I got nothing

There’s nothing
I want to have sex, that’s it
Strippers don’t work, they just make it worse I think…
Full intercourse is probably cheating…
(hehe probably)
So am I just left with my hand?
That’s awful, that’s sad
I might have to try intercourse to see if that changes anything…
I know that’s bad
But I think not doing that might be worse for me
If I don’t get inspiration I’ll go crazy
I mean I wish I’ll go crazy, but I’ll probably just die inside from boredom

I have no power
ססעמק
I do not know what I want
I do not want anything

I need to be able to run things on aws
I need something like a bolt
It should not be too complicated
This is a total aws in cmd
So all I can do is not run here, I just need to run on a server
But how do I do that from ios?
I need some app that can run aws
I can use juno but it&#39;s just to connect to a server that is already running
How do I run a new server?
I can try to run from one juno to another juno
But then I have to add permissions and such
Shortened mess

If success is guaranteed what would I try:
fly
Cure cancer
Set up a startup
Break Turing
Fuck Bar Refaeli
Find eternal life
Raise my mind to the cloud

I can use a termius but it does not seem to me that anything can be run from it
Maybe from juno
