I need $ 2 million to live on NIS 5,000 all my life plus $ 5,000 per child for the next thirty years
If I build on live up to 120
Why because I have 120 years on 5000
5000 is 60,000 a year, double 120 is NIS 7,200,000 about $ 2 million
But come on, if I work on 10,000 shekels for 30 years and retire, then I end up earning everything I needed, which is 120 * 30 which is only 3.6 million shekels

In this pension fund, an employee who earns 5% every month
The employer adds 5% and another 8.33% in compensation
Then I get at the end 50% of the income forever
That means I will get at the end 18.33% * 30 = ~ 512% and then I will live from 50% for much more than ten years
Probably 30

I can in theory earn twice as much and then quit at 45
But then I have to pay for ages 45-60
Another fifty percent, that means a million and a half dollars
Not really
I can just leave the rest of the money aside and then pay myself at 45
Then you only need 20% for the provisions
In any case, you need them


I want to work on something that interests me this time
So why not natural language, if it&#39;s interesting anyway?

A million dollars, how do you make a million dollars?
That a million people will buy something from me for a dollar
