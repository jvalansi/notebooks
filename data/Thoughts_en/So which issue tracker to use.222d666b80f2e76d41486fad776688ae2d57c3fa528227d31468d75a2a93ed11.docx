If I can not make a hierarchy of tasks in Gitleb
I can run a project from any task that falls apart
But even there there is no hierarchy
I can use tags
But even there there is no hierarchy
I can reference any task to her children and vice versa
I can add the feature to Gitlab but I do not really know Ruby

Another problem is that it does not run offline
By and large this should not be too much of a problem
But come to think of it, this happens too often
I can create an application that implements the Gitlab API and in addition it has internal memory to enable offline operations
But I do not really know Swift
