What else?
When did the interview come in?
On guitar day?
On a day without a book?
Also the guitar is only twice a week
I need to add the sun to get to 3 days
So what happens in the first?
Study for an interview and play the guitar
Then also Tuesday and Thursday (because even then you play)
What about the emails?
I can split it do during the week
Every day
And what about planning the week
Yes maybe it&#39;s unrelated
Emails and planning can be left to the surfer or first responder

So an interview on Tuesday and Thursday, and maybe Sunday.
