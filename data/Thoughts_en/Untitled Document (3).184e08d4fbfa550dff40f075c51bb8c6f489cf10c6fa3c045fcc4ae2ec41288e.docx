It&#39;s Sheeran&#39;s birthday
I wrote her a greeting
I&#39;m missing a line
Have fun in our lives
Or in the school of our lives
then what
Do not know
That you will continue to be the
Unless you can be a Wonder Woman
It&#39;s best to register Batman
Well I finished
What else?
Tomorrow we&#39;ll go somewhere
Then Tuesday-Wednesday another place
Then last Thursday
Friday flying
Time flies
