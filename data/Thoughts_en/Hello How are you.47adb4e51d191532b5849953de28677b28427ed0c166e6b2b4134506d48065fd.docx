Hello How are you?
What about you?
This is the most general question one can ask a man
Or in English how are you, how are you
What&#39;s the way you are?

I&#39;m a little frustrated
I have to work for about 15 years to be free
Sheeran annoys me with how much she can do nothing on her own, and the fact that her belly has grown.
 
What except
I&#39;m working on this project trying to find a way to predict good stocks
I need data for this, but it costs $ 150
I can simulate the amount of data to see if it can predict, for example only using p / e

I have a sea of work at work, and little time

I want a new computer, but it&#39;s about 1000 euros
