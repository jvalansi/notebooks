Buffett argues that you can understand enough about a certain subject in order to know how to invest in it
If this is not true, then it is impossible to identify a good start-up to invest in it
Understanding the field! -> Start-up identification
Otherwise - there is no preference for a good idea -> You can make any idea

2nd law.docx,"Assumptions:
The particle fits through the doorway with epsilon degrees wiggle room
This means that the probability that a particle that approaches the (center of the) doorway crosses it is (without the door itself), is epsilon/180
The door opens up to 90 degrees to one side only.
The door’s mass is negligible (does not change the course of the particle).

The probability to cross with the direction of the door:

Say there’s epsilon degree in which the ball can pass then the probability of a particle, that goes towards the door, to pass is epsilon/180 (probability that the ball is heading the right direction)

The probability to cross against the direction of the door:

Say there’s epsilon degree in which the ball can pass then the probability of a particle, that goes towards the door, to pass is epsilon/90 (probability that the door is sufficiently open) times epsilon/180 (probability  that the ball is heading the right direction)

In total there’s 90/epsilon times more chance that a particle will cross with the direction of the door than against it."
מסמך ללא שם.docx,"A program to learn from an interviewer to Lening
Five sites
Every day solve a question
Repeat Andrew's courses

There are between 100 and 1000 computational learning questions, and between 10 and 100 questions in language processing
How many questions to do?
I have 4 weeks and Christmas
What would I do at Christmas?
When will I go on vacation after Christmas?
Maybe around April to week

Each day will be 4 weeks * 5 days, 20 questions
You have to do 5 questions a day to get to 100
Every question 20D, that means ~ two hours a day
Or you can do a few questions an hour
That should be enough
It's 20 hours
3 weeks for computational learning and one week for language processing
Besides do the preparation course of Andrew
It's 10 ~ weeks, and every week five hours, I can do a lesson on a tight day, or two days, or just an hour a day then it will take really 10 weeks.

What about my project?
It is more important
We have to keep working on him
But how much more?
Right now he is not really giving results
Even though it seems there's something there
It's not quite clear yet
There's a lot more work to do
The question is how much work to put on it
I also have the option to spot good stocks using xgboost
There is also a possibility to go through a project
I just have to decide when enough

So for Andrew's course, if I want to finish by the end of the year, I should give 50 hours in 4 weeks.
It means 12 hours a week, it's 3 hours 4 times,
I have to finish two and a half weeks a week, that's a lot
What about the project then ...
I can postpone it in a month ...

But I have to decide when enough
I've invested on this project full of time, if you include all the attempts before (of deepmoney)

What do I do with all the emails?
What about all the bookmarks?
What about the missions?

I need to think of potential benefit
On the one hand I'm wasting time
On the other hand, what will I do at this time?
With all the plans I had already closed next year

I have 3 things to do a day, 21 a week, half (10) I work, another 5 I work on my stuff, another 5 for Shiran.
I do not have such free time.
You can change it to 3 to work on things, 3 free and 4 sing

I go through the emails every day on the return trip, I also have to start reading an article
The tasks I need to clean as well

What should be cleaned?
This job lists tasks, radars, emails and bookmarks
At home it lists tasks, missions, emails and bookmarks

Everything should be in one place
Probably something like radar or asana
The problem is that I do not have a component of my own in Brad, my private missions do not have a place
And Asana is also not a tool of anything,
The emails have to become tasks, the bookmarks I try to read one day ... One private private one of the work
The problem is that there's usually something in Mail that I can read before I get there
The private tasks also need to be in the project management tools
I can give Jira a chance, I guess, but I do not think it will change completely, not the emails, not the missions, not the bookmarks ..."

Untitled document(2).docx,"How do I not waste my life…
What’s wasting life?
Just doing nothing
But that’s meditation, no?
Not exactly. Meditation probably involves inner examination or something…
Actually in meditation I’m supposed to not think of anything, so it’s actually exactly doing nothing.
And it’s actually harder than doing something, like playing video games or watching tv.
So is watching tv or playing video games wasting time?
Wasting is misusing, or not using something useful.
Time is useful, because it can be used.
So is watching tv and playing video games not useful?
If it brings joy, it’s probably not so bad.
I guess it’s about looking back and saying that was useful.
If I watch tv, after that’s over I look back, how do I feel.
So maybe I should say it’s not satisfying.
What is satisfaction?
I guess in general satisfaction is reaching a threshold.
Commonly meant for reaching a threshold of one’s expectation.
So if I’m not expecting to get anything, there’s not threshold and anything I do is satisfying.
But is that the case? Can I not expect anything? It’s like just waiting to die.
What’s missing? What do I expect?
Good question.
What’s my biggest problem?
Lack of freedom. Everyday I have to go to work. I can’t have sex with other women.
So do I expect to solve that? Would that satisfy me?
For work I can just save enough money that it generate enough to sustain half a family, probably around 500k. It’s going to take ±6 years from now…
What do I do with the women part?
I can do that behind the back or I can get a divorce?
I can just walk the border and go to strip clubs…
That’s not complete freedom, but being single might also not be complete freedom.
THere’s no such thing as complete freedom.
I’ll cross that bridge I guess.

If I want to use my time right I need to move further to being free. The problem is that many times that’s not fun. And then I’m wasting time I could use for fun.
So what’s more important freedom or fun?
I guess both are. That’s why I’m dividing my free time in 2, one part for fun (3/21 parts of the week) and one part for work (4/21 parts of the week)
So for fun I should only care about fun, not satisfaction. If that’s the case I should go to strippers.

The problem is that it’s expensive. It’s ±200$ each time.
Looks like video games is the next best, but it’s a bit more expensive, so then there’s tv, they are pretty much tied.

What else?

אלוהים יקר רציתי שתדע שאני יודע איפה אתה.docx,"Dear God, I wanted you to know that I know where you are, really it's interesting why I ask myself this all the time, it's a little puzzling, this blind writing is nice to Allah but it's hard for me to believe that after that I'm going out of a completely blind writer, In some way of thinking, I do not write as fast as I think, speech was really great but I have a feeling that it is not as practical as writing, writing can be edited right away and speech is not, I can also just think for an hour, but it's not so practical Because then I fall asleep, and what if I just walk in the street and think, I have too many stimuli, so I have to go where there are no people, but I I think that my parents tell me it is dangerous to go alone, not like the child in the story, who had barely a fatherly touch, and in the end he was murdered. I do not know, but I have a feeling that he was hit in the stomach, just where he always felt the psychosomatic pains. I'm sure there's a connection between length or lifestyle and how many people love you. When you love, you're happy when you project happiness. , Like this girl from a fist, she's really cute, hurt by everything, she has a funny but she's really cute, and she's also a girl who looks great and pays attention to me because the mountain In my class there are about a thousand and one men on three girls who are worth something too, so it's not fair. I do not mean to fight. It seems superfluous to me. Every time I go out, I have a phone without starting anyone. But I still have a dilemma, but I still think that if I try too hard to go to this course (and pay at least 2000 shekels) I do not know if it pays because in the end what they say It will be yourself, just totally mean do not be afraid of what she wants and try to be what she expects but will be with her, do not change for her, be the leader man what is called, I have A lot of appreciation for the leaders, it's the leader idea as it was written in my sister's book They do not need anyone to be next to them and precisely because that everyone wants to be next to them, it's from such a thing as they said to create attraction that juggle between good and evil, Think that if you are good for everyone, but not personally, then everyone will be good to you, because they will not think you are doing it for something, on the other hand there are all those who are anti and they attract people to them, precisely because they are anti, With low self-esteem, like Little and her company, but I do not want such negative people around, how do I learn, is this a beautiful question, I thought it was all conceptual I feel that the lowest or rather basic question is what I want, and I do not know what I want, and because of this I try to formulate basic assumptions, such as causality I can not completely agree, (for example, because it negates my ability to choose), but it shows a lot of logic, as well as statistics, it can show a lot but does not require, and all sorts of basic assumptions, so I went towards evolution to try to understand where Comes the concept of will, or what is the difference between us and animals that only act according to instincts of impulses, although even in this I can not be sure, and basso But I want to do only what I want to do, and in my studies at the Technion, I'm not sure it's true, because culture is directing me, and perhaps the culture was created. From the moment this creature called man had time to think not only of what he had to survive, his thought was not only gene-oriented, but also order-oriented, and he tried to conceptualize the world, to call everything in terms, The outside world will be able to predict it better, whether it has succeeded in the meantime And we have also developed technology thanks to the fact that we know that the city brings energy that can be used to turn wheels that can be used to transport transportation, and we can turn electron flux into information like this on the computer, and we also know to route it to space and back to earth To create communication and even more ... Internet, so it's great we harness the information to reality, and use it but why, in order to have more money, yes I feel I want money but why, to have a bigger house? Why? To have girls? So that I would have a family so that my children would not have anything to lose? It's a good question, I like to solve questions or maybe ask them, like the historical dialectic driven by questions, how genes came to the questions, and if the gene is so selfish, why do not I know what I wanted to ask? I do not understand very well, and the question of when he stopped controlling our lives, and why, I understand the recursion in what survives is what is planned to survive or rather survives is the best person not to survive, so why the garden and he is the only one who does it, He has reached his advanced level in order to replicate, because even fire is replicated, so what is the thing, what is special about the gardens, how they did not have competition, I usually notice that there is not much competition Everyone does what suits him and it is the best, although there is competition within a species, I mean you better because you're competing with yourself, or anyone else, understand? So we still have the instinct, the question of what I do with everything I wrote now, what is the idea of ​​arranging it, what does it help me to order, why do I aspire to order, do I aspire to order or predict the future, or why? Harmony, what is it? It was nice writing blind, but you noticed how you did not talk about the sex of most of this writing? Is not that what controls our lives, the reproduction? I understand the theory of the selfish gene, but in humans it feels a little less relevant, even though the leader has the ambition that your influence will remain forever, your seal, but it seems to me to be due to how much we attribute a positive feeling to all those who are remembered, I know that I saw that he would not last very long, but I also noticed that every time we had the whole family with him and that he got a lot of love he suddenly felt better, is not it also But it's like I came to get him out of the bathroom, so after a night we were all with him and held on I do not get a lot of love, that's how I feel at least, it seems to me that many negative people are just because they did not get much love, I do not really know But it's important to find what I want or like to do, when in fact that's what I do most of the time trying to answer, trying to look for answers , Or ties Relationships is also an important concept, it connects me to relationships, relationships between concepts, it's the connections I talk about, it connects me to language, how its structure starts from the worker and there I want to think about how to learn effectively, but why I'm at the Technion Yes, so what, why do I need something from the Technion? Why do I need the Technion? Just follow what my friends did, enjoy it you like to think, it's just that, it's thinking, and a lot, so do it you have questions, you have problems, try to think about them but then I do exactly what culture expects of me, Influence culture, that's what you do, through your thinking, what question you want to answer? It does not matter, the Technion gives you tools, such as language, without language, how you would think, try to think without language, like in gibberish meditation, try to control your thinking, can you really do that, what do you think when you think , But for masturbation it 's not the same, as with a girl, oh I would like someone who is just flowing, someone just fuck her whenever I want, because that' s what fun is called, but they think about marriage, Not all of them, but they do not get fed up after they do it once with a certain man, but why not, years of evolution have done their work, all their eggs are bigger, but what a huge difference happened, huh? This is a nice thing, they take a theory, and what you catch, it stays, not like that, usually it will be a mistake but in the meantime it allows development, so take a basic hypothesis and check it, and if it is not correct then it will progress, There is more or less true. For example, it is hard for me to imagine that someone could have predicted Einstein's theory before Newton. Nothing is safe except for the concepts. Which you define, although at the moment the language has quite defined for me, and then what concepts can I build theories to die like mathematics, how I am Know what I like? Question, then assume that you love something specific, and if you do not you will already feel it,"
אינטליגנציה.docx,"intelligence
All the brain thinks the same way, in the patterns of time space, all the senses simply pick up changes in the environment and pass them through the nerves, if it is light, then there is a nerve that receives if there is more or less light, if it is sound then there is a nerve that receives the frequency of sound, This is the amount of food in the stomach that affects hunger, all are patterns of changes in space and time, and patterns are linked to each other. The input of a cat will be characterized by pointed ears, the sound of ""meow"" and even without feeling it, we will know that its fur is pleasant to caress, Time, all the time there is a transfer of information (many we ignore, the changes are the ones that usually grab attention
These templates are stored in memory but in a special way,
The memory is preserved in a certain sequence, you can not see an overall picture straight, you can only remember in the process, such as song, character, detail detail,
Memory completes patterns, it receives information and complements it alone, according to the input
What is important in the accepted patterns is not the exact input, but rather the relationship between the Celts. When we recognize a person, we not only recognize that he has eyes, but also recognize the distance between the eyes of the Prophets, and even if we focus on him from a different direction in a different light,
Intelligence is the predictive ability of the mind, the self-completion ability of the absorbed pattern, the mind constantly complements its input patterns, and tries to predict from the memory of the past the continuation of input, what it is supposed to absorb, the meaningful thinking is obtained only when the desired pattern is exceeded For example, memory also controls behavior, behavior is the result of our prediction of what is supposed to happen, first we believe the action, and the body in response to the operation
Cortex operation

The cortex is made up of six layers, with information running up and down, rising up, manipulating the handle, maximizing analysis, and dropping down in feedback form to predict its expectation, completing the current pattern, and testing itself, , If there is something to learn, or where the situation is clear and well known, the feedback can also descend down the cortical areas of the cortex, thus ordering action appropriate to the current pattern.
Each area in the cortex works quite the same, identifies the pattern in the current input and passes it on, leaking the least important details, to each pattern or series, a group of organs it preserves representation or gives a name, which it transmits
The hierarchy in the cortex represents the world, logic is actually induction and deduction, understanding the pattern, or the relationship between things, building a whole of parts, and deduction, separating the whole into parts,

In the lower layer, all input comes directly from the neural receptors, ie from the senses, when there are inputs that come together, they move on together to the next layer, and a generalization is formed. The next time only some of the inputs that appear together come, And each time these inputs appear repeatedly, the bonds become stronger, and our predictive power rises. Collecting inputs together is actually naming or conceptualizing a phenomenon, such as, for example, the input of a stem with leaves gives the concept of a tree, Melody Once the prediction is wrong, it is necessary to investigate the matter, break down into components or search for different patterns
The action is part of thinking, it is simply the continuation of processing through the nerves associated with the position of the body at any given moment, for example when at the corner of the eye we have a sense of a rapidly growing object that is approaching, instinctively protect ourselves from this direction, because we already know the pattern that says that if an object approaches me Quickly, it's likely to hurt, but even a non-instinctive stunt works the same way
Gestalt, the sense of reaching the conclusion arises from the moment the template is appropriate for the input data, when like in the puzzle everything fits in place
The separation of syllables is the main employment of the cortex, then the separation of words, the imitation of words, the construction of sentences, etc., so that in adulthood the separation of syllables is already performed with almost the input
The short-term memory, the new memory, is in the hippocampus, when there is an input that is not suitable for any pattern, it is stored in the hippocampus for immediate use, but if it is not needed, it will be lost as soon as new information arrives.
The thalamus deserves the information that needs to be focused on it at that moment

Intelligence is in fact the ability of prediction and memory and it exists from the dawn of life, as the basic activation of the cell, which is separated from the outside, but receives information from it and uses it (for reproduction, for food ...)
The next stage was the ability to change the predictive and memory capabilities during life, meaning that it is not just a genetic charge but an environment
The latter ability is the ability to create concepts or names as a substitute for direct learning. This is the communication known to certain species of animals, but is performed much more intensively in humans
Creativity is openness to patterns, that is, repeated attempts to understand or challenge existing patterns. When we are not committed to the template, we do not work with stereotypes and are able to come up with a whole new approach to
Awareness is actually the sum of the declarative memories that are realized in us, that is, things we can talk about. If we erase the memory of a specific day, that is to say, we will return his mind to the precise state in which he was the day before, then he will be sure that the last day did not exist at all. Because he was unaware of his actions the day before, even though when he did them he was fully aware of it,
Consciousness is the ability to concentrate or to tune in to certain things, free will
Imagination is the patterns we create in our heads, even when there is no complete picture we can complete it in our imagination, and when we think of a certain concept we can go down to it in detail as if it existed"

Suppose there is a certain amount of money that you receive, and then the more you divide the larger the donation the next amount will be larger
People will still consume now, because they must, but less,
It is possible to normalize the distribution of income
The problem is that it requires a central system, and it never works
Maybe if the system is devoid of human hands, and there will be no room for corruption, then it will work
Maybe computing can do it, a system like Bitcoin
Maybe this is a normal distribution creature
Currently the distribution is abnormal
In communism, the normal distribution is like a delta function (the Delta function can be registered as normal with a standard deviation of zero)
The Gini index aspires to communism, only when all have equal income, the slope of the graph is constant
For a normal distribution the slope will go up to the middle, and then fade away, because the decline in the number of people fades faster than the amount increases (the income rises linearly and the voyages decays exponentially)
In capitalism, the slope only increases, and income rises faster than the distribution fades
Does this not stem directly from capitalism?
If I give a free market, can I predict how income will split?
Everyone takes raw material and turns it into something, and earns the difference between how much it cost him and how much he sells
Usually raw material includes his personal talent, the price is determined according to supply and demand
If it is rare and desired, its price is higher
Let's say a simple world
There are only 2 products, and two people, one produces food and two produces clothes
They can simply agree that one will produce the food for them and the other will supply the clothes
It is possible to determine that food production time is equivalent to the production time of clothing, and then they simply exchange a product after working the same amount of time
The problem begins when there are fewer types of products than consumers, because then a certain product can take over the market and lead to a monopoly, and then the capital concentrates in one place, over a few people
For example: housing, communications, money (bank), food, transportation,
The truth is that it's almost everything
Everyone wants to live in Tel Aviv
In the truth media that put in competition (there are still only 3 large companies)
Money has 3 large banks
Food has about one food company
Transportation also has relatively few companies (and huge taxation)
Nothing to do is also due to the fact that we are herd, tend to cluster around one product



The Fermi Paradox -
If within millions of years we are supposed to take over the whole universe given that it is free
So any culture that has emerged in the last billion years has already appeared, it is supposed to happen in these millions of years, a low chance of collisions between such events
The chance that two life forms will be created at the same time is like the chance that we will take 10 corn kernels and the first one will be two nuclei at the same time
For 100 nuclei the chance of two exploding together is low (rarely happens) and the difference between 2.5 and 10 seconds of the explosion is much lower than one thousandth
The truth is that the ratio is quite the same, there are 100 nuclei and 600 tenths of a second in 1 minute, and there are 10,000 suitable stars and the difference between one million and one billion is 1000
The chance that the first of about 10,000 explosions will be of two is not high, because it happens about one to 10
(Ten million every year, out of a billion that everyone will ""explode"", initially exploding every second or so, it means a chance of 1 to 10, that's about the quantity, so maybe it's about 50 50)
If you break down a normal distribution it's like measuring 10,000 people, and the two lowest ones will be about the same millimeter, or the highest
This chance is sure to be lower than the chance to take just two people from the range where the elevations are closer (around average)
And around the average chance is low, so it is safe to lower the edges
No matter how many people there are, the chances of me choosing two of the same height are nil
Although with 10,000 at the same 1000 it should be quite common. The chance that this will not happen in a certain second is that all ten will do it separately,
If there is enough (say 10 ^ 10) then it is reasonable to assume that the lowest at the same height, because most people will be on the same height, they are divided within a range of meters, but still the chance of taking two averages exactly the same height is against me,
Ok because it's not true it's not like picking two at the same height, it's the chance to have someone at the same height for someone random, and this prospect is actually high in the area around average when there are many people
In this world there is a billion and the chances are low, there is someone safe in my height, but the lowest of the low ones seems to be alone there. In most competitions the result is normal, and the peak is one. Most of the Guinness records are normal distribution phenomena. Suppose they represent all human beings, if anyone was better he would probably try, most people (at least in the western half) know the Guinness World Records
Conclusion chances are there are no aliens

Puzzle:
Or with which the amount, or the difference of the other two
He knows that if one is registered 65 to two X and the third is registered
Y = 65 +/- X
Both see 65 and Y
Third sees 65 and X

Suppose
Y = 65 + X
It can not be that X = 65, Y can not be 130
It can not be that X = Y
I want a situation where
Y = 65 - X
Can not exist, ie Y = X
It will not happen

Suppose
Y = 65 - X
Then you need a situation in it
Y = 65 + X
Can not exist, because Y = X
That too will not happen

And divide the time by how much credit each task has
It's as if the opposite is preferable
A lower priority is more important
Higher credit is more important
I can reverse this with the inverse
1 / x
Then what is priority 1, there is credit 1
What is Priority Two has a credit of 0.5
3 - 0.333
4 - 0.25
Although if I had to choose manually, if priority 1 would give 100 credits, priority 2 would give half of it?
Maybe
And priority 3-thirds?
Or eighth?
Good
So what's most important to me?
financial independence?
Maybe I should talk to someone who is a money manager, an accountant
Right now according to my calculation, if I put aside 50 each year (currently it's more like 40 because of the lease)
I should release another 6-7 years if I make 8% on the money
Because then I reach 625 k
And I get 50k a year that's a little more than 4 a month, which is completely round
So if that happens, then what am I doing in the meantime?
Do I have to do anything in the meantime?
This year I'm probably going to the blues, because of tax returns and stuff
I pay full tax
A third of what I earn
The question is whether to maximize the 401k
I do not think I can put more in there
Or I can, and then build on tax returns
In general, the best thing I can do at the moment for my bottom line is to move
Buena in Malibu This lease is tens of thousands
What else can I do?
Try to manage the tax
There are 3 components:
How much I put in
How much I spend
How much tax do I pay?
The rest is saving
If I increase income, reduces expenses, reduces tax, I improve my situation
I spend more than a third, and the tax is about a third
Maybe I'll consult a CPA
Besides it also has my ability to really bring 8% net yield
In real estate I can bring 10 properties, if anyone brings $ 200 it's already half of what I need
And only at $ 20K to one, it's 200k
I should all double that
If in real estate I really do 12%, I am free within 3.4 years
This is amazing
How It Works?
At the end of the year I have 160k I can buy with them 8 properties each in 20k that put 200 each and so on 1600
In the month,
Next year I save 50 and earn 200 * 12 * 8 = ~ 20k, so I can buy another 3 properties (so I need duplexes), which bring another 600
A year after I save 50, and earn 200 * 12 * 11 = 26k, total 76 I buy another 4 properties (two duplexes), bring another 800
A year later, saves 50 and earns 200 * 12 * 15 = 36k, total 86k buys another 4 properties, another 800 and finished
And this is a free man within three years
What fun it could be
This is through real estate
Maybe I should check what happens with the gurus deal
Well they said June
Nothing is certain
Anyone can throw numbers
4 properties per year, within 5 years I am free (or two duplexes)
dream
If not, but I manage to bring 8% on the capital market, I'm free for another 6-7 years, so the difference is not significant
Do not know if it is 8% in the market, because I put part of the bonds that it is nothing yield
If this bond is 2% and the capital market is 8% then it will be divided by 75% -25% I get
8 * 0.75 + 2 * 0.25 = 6.5
And then I'm free for another 8-9 years
Good,
But how much time do I need to spend on my life?
As if in the worst case, it looks like I'll be fine for another 8-9 years
I can shorten it by half with good investments in real estate
It is excellent
But how free time is worth it
Why not invest in what really interests me, which is natural language processing in the meantime
Is that really what interests me?
What do I feel like doing with it?
I want to build a bot chat?
What can you do with it?
I'm messing around with this Larning machine because he can do it all at the end
So what about reading reports?
What if he could read Wikipedia and answer any questions?
What about something with economic use?
What about he going to be a lawyer?
Or if he can read financial reports?
But perhaps need a simpler task
What about reading comprehension
Read text and answer questions
Okay, and why use it?

Well, I'm here
What now?
I can come in and do one round
Twenty poor
But I have to go in that path
What about dinner?
Do not know if critical
Right now
What now?
I have no idea
I did not drink water today
Every hot drink requires a cold drink
And what about going to a club?
No one calls you in
So how do you get in?
Why enter?
As if alone is irrelevant
Well I do not know
So what now?
You have to look at everything as what its worth is according to the current yield
So if the current yield is 6.5% then for example the value of my lease is 3000: 0.065 = 550k
That's a lot
I just need another 200k to stop working
And I have more than half that
So what am I doing?
Do not know
What do I feel like doing?
You do not have to do anything
What are you doing?
sex?
I do not have anything I just want to do ...
Maybe it's temporary
Maybe there's just nothing
What about understanding, artificial intelligence?
Could there be something like that?
Yes
now?
No
soon?
Sure
how?
Could there be artificial intelligence without going through Turing?
I'm not sure
Could be the opposite
If artificial intelligence is to be created, you can ask him to go through Turing
He may not pass
But he will have wisdom
Can be

How do I get there?
I can try to build such a thing, to make contact with people
The aspiration is as much interaction as possible without being told that he is a robot
I need some sort of general chat
Like irc
There must be
And what an api
Although it is not enough signal I guess
I need a bot chat that does some reinforcement
I think I'm cutting home

So you can actually train the robot to answer questions
And the only dialogue he holds is answers to questions
And if he does not know the answer he is looking for her
The problem is that most questions are personal
The information is not ""outside"" but ""inside""
That he can get from other people"

פוליטיקה.docx,"Objective: To be the center of gravity of the team
You have a quantity of credit and you need to determine who you are distributing it to.

For example, for three players:
If the other two give each other more than a lost king
The goal is for both of them to give you more

You can also give yourself
You need to be given the most
Everyone is trying to achieve this
So that's why they invest more in the weak, which does not threaten you
On the other hand you do not want only the support of the weak
Because it is also important how powerful and supportive you are
You want to have the highest self-vector value
You want to be the first in the page rank
That's what everyone wants

For three players:
There is a 3 * 3 matrix
You set one row to maximize your page rank

How does the page rank work?
You take the self-centered hexagon to about 1 self, because it's the solution of steady state.

For two:
Av = v
a11 * v1 + a12 * v2 = v1
(1-a11) v1 + (1-a12) v2 = v2

a11 * v1 + a12 (1-v1) = v1
a12 = (1 + a12-a11) v1
a12 / (1 + a12-a11) = v1

a12 = 0.5 * (1 + a12-a11)
a12 + a11 = 1
pole: 1 + a12 = a11 -> a11 = 1, a12 = 0

According to each player it is better to simply invest only by himself
There is no guarantee that investing in someone else will help

The problem is that I do not include taxes and inflation

This means that the order of size from 1000 to 1000 was considered 1000-2000 times
This means that if on a day I get 1000-2000 shekels I need 1000-2000 of them, which is between 3-6 years, or if you do not calculate Friday, then 5-10 years
Or I'll just get 10000 a month forever, which means NIS 300 a day, or NIS 500 a day excluding Shabbat
how do I do it?
I need NIS 10,000 from the apartment, a two-room apartment in Dizengoff is worth about 5000 shekels a month, and worth about 2 million, it means 2 needs for 10,000 a month, that means 4 million for that.
So how do you get NIS 4 million?
10000 a month is 120 thousand a year, it's about 3 percent per year, it's not that much, only 3 percent inflation, but it's related to inflation, so basically it's 3 over inflation
There are better investments

I would like to develop an app, how much money is worth?
Facebook Yahoo and LinkedIn make about $ 1-2 a year, Google makes 10 per year
According to the assessment of a dollar for a foreigner, I need 120,000 shekels a year, which is 30,000 dollars, that means 30 thousand people,
By the estimate of 10 cents I need 300 thousand

We sometimes think and reach a decision node that activates the decision network in the brain. This network takes into account many factors before making a decision. Sometimes also factors programmed by our knowledge. In the case of humans it is not limited to private knowledge but to collective knowledge (in some animals, too, this is not limited to private knowledge but much more limited). The collective is able to program the individual, and this is not necessarily a bad thing, it brought us here.
We are basically like a computer,

אני רושם רק בגלל הסימן מהוורד.docx,"I write only because of the sign from the rose, which did not close immediately. After I remembered to keep most of the roses that I had closed earlier, I did not close the recording and I did not keep changes
So I apologize in advance if it's a retard
Okay it's a lack of confidence that comes after you're sure you've got something big
And that's exactly the wave I'm talking about,
Everything is also in our thinking
The rising wave when we are creative is unique and comes down when we want to be like everyone else to communicate with everyone,
When people try to be too creative then they push it too much digging what is called as I do now, so they also fall back deep into insecurity
The way to reach an agreement is to trust the name to do what it needs to do, and then reach the resonance frequency. Do not try too hard and on the other hand do not try to be like everyone else (this is what leads to insecurity)
It also reminds me of the theory that the size of all is 1 and only our projection of culture varies from one to the other, but those who have a low culture projection are those who can pull the highest string the so-called, dig the deepest in their resonance
Let this flow, and pull this string on one hand to try to dig to reach some conclusion that will shock the world from ego ego pride and on the other hand this side of culture to be very civilized thinking
It's strange that when you release you get the most creative, but when you pull on the string it's because you're trying to be the most creative
So let my brother stop writing, bye

Well, it's hard for me to shake off this aspiration to write, which I think comes from the desire to live forever, or to create something that will remain behind me, like the urge to make a child that comes because it's better for survival, Because it is better for the survival of culture
These are the philosophers, I'm not sure everyone knows who they are, our culture is instant, meaning that the heroes are those who live now, or not. Long ago, like the Beatles or Britney Spears
They sacrifice the high climb in the cultural strings, that is, they sacrifice influence in favor of popularity, they could be higher and more influential if they were not looking for the material, because that's it, it's like two opposites that feed each other, the material and the spirit, With your influence you can get more material
Sometimes you want to give up immortality to get more now, and sometimes reverse
I unpack the stella
Paradox Law: A certain choice is correct if the other choice leads to a paradox
For example, if I believe that in order to develop a theory I have to release and not try to develop it by force, then the only possibility is to release, because if I want to develop the theory I have to let go because the theory says that I will open it, and on the other hand if I do not want to develop it then In any case I will release
Or if you believe that in order to get a girl you need to release then the only option is to release, because if you want her then you have to release, and if you do not want her then you will release
On the other hand, these beliefs need not be believed in the first place
I have a theory here that women are the second class after leaders and before being led
It is chauvinistic, but it also works to have women leadership, but a little less, and women are led but less,
The more the man is more indifferent to women in the short term so the more women he will have in the long run, the more indifferent he is more philosophical, or something that is more influential in the culture is more of a leader, on the other hand some is more conformist to culture is less wanted, By the women, but he has more friends
It's a bit strange how these theories arise after I smoke?
Another point: any contrast is something that also has a contrast, for example, animal and cultural are opposites, but both are reversed from apathy
How do I know what's right?
What do I know?
What do I decide
I have a feeling that I decide only when to release, I mean if I dig something, I can only decide to stop or continue, if I continue I stretch the string
Most influenced by culture are those who pulled the most distant string, and released
Like mine mines when something suitable for many things you knew then probably is true
Morality - good and evil, logic - right wrong, metaphysics - there is not
There is good and true, no bad wrong"

Maybe for communication, so that I can speak objectively so that everyone will understand me, communicate with others,

Has culture begun with ""concept"" or ""good versus bad""
What's good or bad is totally subjective, but it's a way of preserving culture, do not murder, it's not good for a culture because it will contain fewer people and so will weaken
But good and evil were before that because genes always dictate what is good and what is bad, every living creature knows that fucking and eating is good and hitting and dying is bad, so once we started conceptualizing everything we should also call these feelings perhaps
But why call it? To improve communication, because better communication means a stronger tribe, says less danger to the garden
Good and evil are already concepts, so I suppose concepts preceded good and evil, when did they start? When a man had time to ask the question, when he had not been busy all day with a survival perhaps?
Then communication through concepts made us stronger, and the concepts themselves began to control us as the genes began to control the material that produced them,

Untitled document(22).docx,"what is going on here?
All yesterday I looked for escort agencies

I do not know what it is

The problem with Asana is that I do not know what to work on
There are a million things, but there's nothing to say to make from tasks to a calendar
In general it should be important at least important
Then the push is at least urgent
Even though I will not be able to produce urgent things


I checked how computers do it

In Windows and Mac it's quite simple:
There are queues with different degrees of importance
Queue with greater importance gets priority
Anyone who is in line for one long time goes on line with greater importance

In Linux:
Always take the one who has the least time
If someone has not finished in the allotted time, the time left for him is rising

It still does not really answer urgency
I guess in the end you have to decide what is a higher priority, and prioritize urgent things

There are systems in which there are two priority types, one of which gets priority over the other, and can replace something with a second priority

Such a thing can only cause urgent things
Because of this, the amount of urgent things should be minimized

What urgent things should I do?

At the moment I do not need anything"
"התרבות מתחילה במושג, בלתת שמות לדברים.._.docx","Culture begins with the concept,
Naming things, so that we can contain them in our imagination

When we gave the concept of feeling good, when we found the term ""good"" and therefore ""bad"", here we set the goal of culture, the goal of course is to avoid ""square"" and the more possible ""good""
Simcha and Ozer are simply words that describe feeling good
Love is a good feeling when its object is external

But actually what is a good feeling, you can not define a concept in the concept itself, then feeling good is actually feeling we would like to be held all the time, that is the very existence we want to maximize,
This is an interpretation of the senses, the senses perceive, and so we feel, even though there is a feeling in the brain, that is to say, love is not exactly accepted by the senses, It limits them, but basically when the interpretation is positive we feel good,
When is the interpretation positive? If we look at the genes, then the interpretation is positive when at the moment the gene is more likely to survive, that is, after eating enough,
But why does beauty make us feel good, what is satisfying, why is symmetry or simplicity considered beautiful?
It seems to me that once again the ""concept"" comes into play, with as few concepts as possible describing as much of the world as it is beautiful, perhaps, it feels good perhaps
Have the advantage of predicting the future through concepts that actually increases our confidence and therefore our genes are supposed to make us feel good about it

After all, animals do not have sex to survive but because it feels good, meaning instinctively they are driven to it,

There is a very great chance that before the existence of the concept of good was already a bad concept, because badness is a generalization of our passions, hunger thirsty and horny, not that they themselves are bad but they make us feel bad, when I'm hungry then it bothers me until I satisfy myself, When I'm horny it bothers me until I satisfy this hunger, the same with breathing, we feel only when the need is not filled, I'm not sure sex feels as good as it feels bad without it, although I think sex is a little unusual in this respect because it does not feel good to breathe , Or drink just hurts us when not, and this pain is the motive, perhaps as strong as he said in a lecture to the lecturer there is nothing that drives more than the rope or hanging Oh, even sleep, maybe there are those who do it for fun, but mostly it is done for lack of choice
It seems to me that what pain just does is overload the brain, the brain is not free to deal with other things because its attention is committed to the painful area, sometimes pain is also harmless but erection can even kill pain, which is a very strange expression because what is the thing if it hurts You do not kill yourself, so the pain that is supposed to deter you from the painful thing, so that you survive, actually does the opposite action and suddenly turns you down.

Humor is a very social thing, it is simply an example of creativity, of dishonest thinking, and the appreciation of it is laughter, such as Mark's imitation, was an exaggeration, that is, I introduced it in an unusual way,"

חופש בחירה.docx,"Freedom of choice
Is this an illusion that stems from the fact that we choose between similar alternatives?
Does living have freedom of choice?
The illusion of freedom of choice versus the illusion of causality
If there is no causation, there is randomness. But there is randomness at the quantum level
What exactly is freedom of choice?
The ability of an entity to choose between alternatives
Can an animal also choose? Can.
Like the donkey that was just between two piles of gravel. He will have to choose even though there is no priority

How can there be randomness and causation?
The quantum solution as far as I know is that when measuring the situation it collapses into one state
Or we can measure only one state, and the other states exist simultaneously
Does this contradict causality
Probably not because science is still standing, and aligns with quantum theory
Why do we have a choice?
Is everything predetermined?
Is it possible to see the other dimensions?
Just as a person is born with one eye. He does not see three dimensions. But it can capture more dimensions
Perhaps a quantum computer can capture more dimensions
Maybe even jump between them
So there is no freedom of choice?"

I have ±160k right now. I should have 200 by next May, 300 by the following July 400 by the following august, 500 the year after that, and 600 the year after that. That’s a year before I’m 40, hopefully, if everything goes well.
If we have 60 to live off of, we’re paying ±10 for taxes I think. Then we have 50 a year that’s ±4 a month. Should be enough for a good life. Probably not in SF.

If I get a job that pays 300k, I get 200k, still living on 60k, saving 140k, that’s like saving 2.3 times more. I should get to 600 in 2-3 years from now. So that’s 2 years difference. Almost half the time. Which is nice.

"Three dimensional Image display, usin.._.docx","
Three dimensional Image display, using laser projection.

Invention Background:
There are many types of 3D displays:
·        Stereoscopic 3D displays show a different image to each eye
·        Auto stereoscopic 3D displays do this without the need for any special glasses or other head gear. within this type, there are several methods, such as:
o       Flat Panel device:
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ A lenticular lens is an array of magnifying lenses, designed so that when viewed from slightly different angles, different images are magnified.
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ A parallax barrier, consists of a layer of material with a series of precision slots, allowing each eye to see a different set of pixels, so creating a sense of depth through parallax. A disadvantage of both technologies is that the viewer must be positioned in a well defined spot to experience the 3D effect.
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ Eye tracking device, that automatically adjust the displayed images to follow the viewer's eyes as they move their head, only suitable for one person.
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ Holographic 3D displays: reproduce a light field which is identical to that which emanated from the original scene
o       Volumetric displays, where some physical mechanism is used to display points of light within a volume. Such displays use Voxels instead of pixels.
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ multiplanar displays, which have multiple display planes stacked up
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ A swept-volume display: the three-dimensional image is formed by illuminating a rapidly moving display surface, which may be a spinning diffuser. Typical schemes use a circular screen rotating at about 900 rpm, which sweeps a spherical volume at each half-rotation.
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ Static volume: In the simplest case, an addressable volume of space is created out of active elements that are transparent in the off state but are either opaque or luminous in the on state. When the elements or voxels are activated they show a solid pattern within the space of the display.

This Invention is based on the auto stereoscopic, volumetric display, with no need of any special device to view the image, and by displaying the image ""as is, and can be viewed from all directions, unlike the flat panel.

Abstract:
The device uses lasers with sufficient amout of energy, that it's light course is seen duo to the existence of impurities in the sorrounding air. by spreding the Laser beam, through a mirror or a lens, thus making it less powerfull so it would not be seen to the viewer, and using a second mirror or lens to focus it to one single point, making it a single voxel in the air, no oother medium needed.
the device consists of many rows of this kind of laser projection, to creat a whole screen, and creating several screens one behind the other, to create a three dimentional image, layer by layer.
there is a possibility to use rotating mirrors to create a scan, not projecting all the lasers at once, but projecting the laser through several lenses or mirrors on a high frequency.

But when he moved, he also had the movement's potential
Yes, but it starts with zero potential
It's another energy, motion energy, if you give up weight, you pay in traffic

Induction - When you see only four wheels included in the car, imagine that there is a body, even though the body's neuron did not fire at all

מסמך ללא שם(28).docx,"For seven more years, with the help of God, I am free from work
Although I will not be free from family,
But at least I'll have ten hours a day five days a week doing what I want
What would I want?

Probably will change
Right now I'm working on this qr
Who might release me before the end of seven years
Although such a project should take several years
So if there's a project, why not something that interests me
Let's say language processing
The ultimate goal is for a computer to understand speech
Pass the Turing test
But what is it to understand?
Let him have a representation of what it is
Let him have a model of what was said
Which can turn text into a three-dimensional model
But what about abstract ideas?
How do you imagine ""peace"" or ""what's the situation""
How do children learn to talk?
At first they speak gibberish
Then slowly they are waiting for what others are saying
""Father Mother""

Baby Talk: The 15 Most Common First Words
1. Dad (or Dada, Daddy, Papa, etc.)
2. Mom (or Mama, Mommy, Mum, etc.)
3. Hi (or Hiya, Hey, Heya, Hello)
4. Buba (Egypt Bub or Baba)
5. Dog (or Doggy, Puppy)
6. Ball
7. No
8. Cat (or Kitty)
9. Nana
10. Bye
11. Duck
12. Ta (or Tata)
13. Baby
14. Uh oh
15. Car
It's words that the child hears a lot
The child is waiting for the environment

When you learn a language, what are the first words?
The most common words
But when we learn a language, we already have a representation of things in mind
Maybe you can learn everything from movies?
Subtitle is the language
What about children's movies?

A machine that uses the principle of ""shoot together together""

Maybe I'll have more insight after the course

What about visualizing a three-dimensional structure from video?
There are many things you can do

Do you need visual imagination at all?

Come on let's release the video
Or maybe we'll pay $ 40 for a video from Faber
Or I'll make something on my own

I was really happy to be able to make videos
But it requires a lot of energy
I can make a presentation easily
I can also add animation
But how do I add characters
If it was possible to add as many fonts as you can add clipart
It is possible, but it is not simple

The options appear to be:

I did not think so at Weizman either
I can check!
2008 at the Technion I wrote a little
I wrote once twice
2014 - 5 times
2015 - quite a lot
2015 - now - a lot
It gets serious
I focus on the past or the future instead of the now
Focusing on the Now may make you happier, but less clever
It seems to me
Pretty sure about the happy but not sure about the wise
So why am I doing this?
order
Maybe when I get out of work I'll feel it
Maybe that's the job
Maybe it was the woman
If you divide every day into three
It is five, two for sleep and three for waking
Two-thirds go to work in mid-hour
A third can go to the family
Right now I'm giving half a third to a woman
And at the end I give a day and a third (if you do not count sleep)
So 10 parts are going to work,
0.5 * 5 + 4 = 6.25 per family
Lee stayed
2.5 + 2 = 4.5
But suppose in freedom I get the 10th, and the family can remain the 11th
Maybe I should take some more
I want myself 11, the family can get 10 and everything is good

Failure to make a decision is also a decision
She rejects the decision to a later date, and then I have to deal with the problem twice

I want to see beautiful things
But I can not see beautiful things here
What beautiful things I can see here
I can flip a cell phone on the cell phone for a moment

Well the cell phone does not connect to the Wi-Fi
In general, I can surf without a Wii

But it's a waste of the data
Look inside if you want to see beautiful things

This nothing is crazy

What do you do?
is nothing

So what are you saying
Listen to Tchlas was cool to make money with Lening Machine
Although in 500 I have an escort girl
Is it okay that's what I want?
It's like what's best for all sides
I do not want to leave
I do not want to hurt
I'm going to an escort girl behind my back ...
Sounds really not like the movies
I'd ask her
But I do not want to hurt her
""Mammy, I do not want to leave you, do you mind if I go to escort girls?""
You need two houses for an escort girl

You can not be an MK and go to escort girls, I guess

I want to start recording in Netbook
I can use this colaboration
But enough with Google
They got scary

I can set up my own environment
The problem is that fucking dollars an hour
Ten working hours and that's ten dollars
And in Google it's free and big

I can run a notebook from the Dropbox
And what do I do with my cell phone?
That's the problem
You can not do this from a cell phone
And there seems to be no solution at the moment
Probably in the future
I can open a netbook
But only if it's in the cloud and I can go to it all the time
In general, you can do it

Amazon EMR is a quarter
That means I have 40 hours a month to get to $ 10
If I work 50 * 20 = 1000 it comes out $ 250
Lots
If I'm willing to pay $ 20 suppose
This is the Worst Case
The average will probably be low
But certainly not by much
And Google is free

הדרך הכי קרובה להתגבר על המוות זה באמצעות צ׳יפ שיתחבר למוח.docx,"The closest way to overcome death is through a chip that will connect to the brain

If this chip is enough like a brain cell, then we can replace a cell cell from the brain with an artificial chip, we're done, we'll live forever

Suppose an artificial neuron costs a million dollars (because it's a lab budget)
Every two years his price fell by half, as long as Moore's Law.
In 40 years costs a dollar.
Then in 80 billion USD it is possible to build an artificial brain.
So multiply a small fraction, a quarter of a brain, 20 billion USD.
In 60 years it will cost 20 million
WALK SHOW.
Perhaps this way it will be possible to live forever"

I have to look where I'm going
I have too many options and I do not know what to choose
I do not know what's even important to me
At some level I have to make money, a certain amount to survive
I also want to learn, but I do not know if it's worth in a frame
I also do not want to suffer. I want me to lift my head to think
Interestingly know code writing especially in the topic of web development
I'm interested in the brain
I do not know if it has any purpose, maybe it's too far from that
I do not know
Basically I have to earn something like 5 thousand for holding myself
And another 5 thousand for each descendant
Even though 5 thousand for me, I do not know if this is realistic
How do I earn 5 thousand in something I love
I have to see if I can get to that as a freelance
The problem is that as a freelance I do not put anything for a pension

What interests me
What do I think most of the time?
What are the concepts that appear most in my writing?
Truth is through a bitch to know what is most interesting to me
The truth is that I'm interested in how the brain works
I think that in the future we will not need people, the ideas will live on another platform
I'm interested in politics
I'm interested in economics
I like to write code
I like to philosophize
I like asking questions


I want a job where I can work on what I want
I want a job where I will earn at least 12 net at some point (I need 5, for two kids I need another 5, and for another one sometime 2.5)
I want something that interests me

Well I have to think about options:
Brain research
Political Science
economy
Web Development
Data Security
business management

I have to rate the options from the exams that I care about:
Interest
Match
Of money
Free time

I have to give importance to every examination:
Most Important Interest - 10
Then free time
Then money
And adaptation

I have to rank each option with the above ratings:

I want half a job, so I can also develop personally what interests me
So the two main options are either research (and scholarship) or web development
If I go to research because of brain or web development, I lose the direction of economics and social / state science, and vice versa
So maybe it's really better to find some part-time Web development"

פוליטיקה(1).docx,"Who is right?
What are the claims:
Hamas: We want a Palestinian state / We want all of Israel
Israel: Cease rocket fire and damage to tunnels

Both sides may be right:
Hamas must stop the rockets and build the tunnels

And Israel must give a Palestinian state to the Palestinian people

Why not?
Hamas will not stop because they want to create international pressure on Israel to allow independence

Israel does not want to allow a state to be a terrorist organization

Solution:
Israel should allow for better conditions for a part that is not under the control of Hamas, thereby making the PLO prefer Hamas
And thereby to topple Hamas

Is that what they want? Good conditions? Or they want freedom at the cultural (religious) level,
I guess there is and there is, as a large percentage of us would like to search on the cultural level
If there is competition here, the two peoples want freedom on the cultural level, how can this be solved?
democracy?
According to the number of people on each side who wants to do so?
I assume that all Palestinians want independence: 4.6 million
In Israel, only about a third of the political map, that is, one third of the people, 8/3 = 2.666 million, wants to prevent independence.
They deserve democracy
I assume that about half of the Palestinians want to destroy us, 2.3 million, and all of Israel wants to remain alive (perhaps except for those who want to be Palestinian, let us assume the size of half of the Arab population, which constitutes about a fifth of the population)
From a democratic standpoint, we have the right to exist

Is democracy the right decision-making method?
(Does government mean making decisions?)
Should a decision be made according to the will of the majority?
Alternatives:
* According to those who want more
* According to those who are stronger
* According to a smarter mash
* According to someone who is richer

Why the hell I need input

The Matrix is ​​going to happen with one difference ... we are not batteries
We spend and put energy in the same amount
In fact, this is not the definition of batteries, batteries bring in and spend the same amount of energy, but they put this quantity in when they are charged, the good thing is that they break down slowly and then there is no direct connection to electricity
The electricity is produced differently, it is usually due to the burning of fuel, the fuel is an organic substance that contains energy, the truth is that we too, but it is much more concentrated because it was in the center of the earth, probably more concentrated than what comes out of it.
So when you buy fuel, it's batteries, why not put a fire on a cell phone?
A fire must be burned, a bug has a controlled chemical reaction that does it, the truth that even in our body the movement is controlled,
Why do not we activate Pelephone from the energy of our body because it is low, wow soon there will not be enough energy in the world to calculate! The calculation is exponentially size, and the energy is not, I believe it will be solved, but it should happen soon, maybe switch to solar energy, wow it's like an explosion, like lighting the earth with fire
It is ingenious to use a living creature, perhaps in biological cells, for direct conversion from coal (or other organic matter) to electricity

תיאוריית גידול אוכלוסין.docx,"Theory:

When an empire is in control, its growth rate (population) stabilizes and decreases, and this causes long-term weakening
When there is a place with wars yet (not under the rule of an empire) the rate of growth has increased (like baby boomers). This is what creates a historical loop.
Rome may have been in control for a thousand years, during which time its growth rate could decrease, and then the Vikings could have been created, and the Huns had multiplied and strengthened in the meantime,
Perhaps this is what is happening today, when the rate of growth is moderating in the Western world, and among the Muslims it is still a high rate.
Today, the population may be less significant, thanks to the power of technology. The more technological wins, not the higher the quantity. Although technological progress is indirectly dependent on the quantity of people.

When more children have less energy directed at each of them, it creates a situation of a lower quality population."

מסמך ללא שם(6).docx,"So what are the goals for the next six months?
Maybe for the coming year?
Then next year I'll think about goals again
Soon the New Year will come true
Actually, in a few months
So what are the goals?
Four doors
Start-ups in natural language, or investments or real estate
What exactly is the start-up's situation?
Do not know
Even now I can say there is a start-up
What are the steps of a startup
Maybe a prototype works
How do I know it's time to move on?
Move to Machine Lening's team
What about physics? The experiment of the doors?
What about learning things?
There's also room for things I did not plan
The problem is that I do not have time for that
About a day at the vacation goes on trips / social activities / things with Shiran
lets see
By seven, I play / make a hinge
Until seven-thirty I was in Radit
By eight (and a half) I did the Google class
By ten o'clock I had eaten dinner and saw a program with Shiran
Now I have about an hour and a little work to continue ...
Not so much
How can you arrange it better?
I'd love to do it at the end. You can eat and then decide that after ten-thirty I stop and we see a series
On a normal day, there are 4 portions that can be divided according to meals, from morning to noon (8-12), noon to noon (12-4) from afternoon to evening (4-8) and evening to night (8-12)
Yes, it is without meals, more real division It is morning to noon (8-12) Lunch (12-13) Midday to evening (13-18) Dinner (say 18-19) and evening to night (19-23) It changed
There is a later dinner, usually at seven
So a third of the day is supposed to be mine, and I have a week five-thirds in the middle of the week and another six on weekends
The truth is that I do not work like a rat
But suppose one day you have to stay free, so actually I have eight-thirds, but not really, because many times there are things in between
It's almost 3 days a week, it's excellent, it's even 4 work days, almost full time.
The question is what I do with them. So the Sabbath does not work, or plan, is great.
In general, I need half a million dollars to retire, meanwhile I have a quarter of that after a year in the US and a year and a half in France. I do not remember the truth how much I had in France. In fact, what's in France is what I have in investments in France, about 50,000. So 75 year round in the US? How it happened, I built 50, and according to my calculation, I get only 40 because our apartment is expensive.
Anyway, up to 500 from now, if I really save 50 a year for another 7.5 years, without a capital gain, that's great
If real estate really works, it can also be 5 years, if I buy 4 doors (at 80 thousand) per year.
How 80 per year? 50 of what I saved that year, and another 30 of what I've already saved (enough for four years but I'll earn more in the past year)
80 * 5 = 400 should suffice, because real estate yield more high
Then between 5 and 7.5 for independence
At this time I can work on a start-up in a field that interests me, such as language processing
Or on trying to speed it up with a learning system,
But what start-up?
Maybe it will come alone
So what did we have?
A one-year plan
Maybe we need a five-year plan?
In five years, I want to be financially free
Meanwhile the plan is through real estate
Maybe I should transfer everything to shares
Now the question of whether to put Interactive Brokers or Robinham
The advantage of this interaction is that it interfaces with a minet, but if rhinohode was interfering with a minet, I had no doubt
But Robinham is free
The question is whether the ten dollars a month are worth this minet
I do not think I would have paid ten dollars for Mint
maybe yes
But here I can still use the Mint, I just need to update, once a month or so the status of investments
It takes a minute
Ten dollars per minute is a lot ...
I think I'll stay in the minet
I meant Robinham
So every six months I get 7-9k ESPP, 7k RSU and every month I get 1330 to 401k which is about 8k in half a year
It means that in the year I get 14 + 16 + 16 = 46 which is about 4 a month
That's what I plan to spend
And that's without extra bonuses
So big time I'm on the way also without moving
I still think it's worthwhile
Or at least Shiran would start working, and pay a little,
But everything is good
So what did we have?
What is the Five Year Plan?
to be free
What more?
Start up startup language processing ...
Let him do what?
Do not know
What would I most like to see?
Or what will happen first if we stop talking?
I stop talking and use the language, what happens?
I get up in the morning, it's all the same
Dressing, pee, brushing teeth, deodorant, breakfast,
Getting on the bus, going to work,
Do not tell anyone goodbye, I can raise my hand if someone is looking
I open a computer, and then I can not do anything
Can not develop anything, can not fix anything
He can go to yeshivas, but he can not contribute anything
Can buy lunch, and eat it
Can go home
Can watch tv
Can not work on projects
Can do sex
Can take a shower
Can go to sleep
Basically, it's all about work
So what is the most important work,
I suppose without farmers we would have died
Even without parents, we would die
But these two things can be done without language
The next thing was teaching
And I think it could be cool if you were a robot teacher
It could be great!
What is working with the largest market?


It seems that:
Management

Good…
So what else?
I want to smoke but we go to the fair
I can smoke at the fair
But I want to smoke with myself
Well, maybe tomorrow
What is this?
tomorrow

What else?
Not too much
I have this matter of physics to check
But it gets complicated
I wanted a simple simulator
But it seems that no simulator is really perfect

What else?
no more
I still do not know how to manage tasks
I'm doing Google's course, which is great
By next week I'll probably be done

What do I feel like doing?
Cook and whores ...
So what is nothing but?
Do not know…
What about computer games?
Civilization?
To control the world
Cook it addictive ...

What do I feel like doing?
Why is this so difficult a question?
Just register
The way things were in all kinds of situations
Situations
What a complicated word
Why is it complicated?
It should not be simple
Because it's general
This too is not simple
What is the simplest word?
what
It's a simpler word than Mama
If words were created according to their simplicity, what should be one of the first words
Why?
So words interest me?
Why?
One can ask why win
And then where will we go?
To something that has no answer
Why do we care why?
Why is this so important?
Because it helps us predict the future
If we know why something happened, given the same conditions we can predict that the same thing will happen again
This is a logical explanation
Maybe it would be great if there was someone to talk to about it
But someone who understands interest
The truth is that you can take information from forums
Or buy or something
And write a bot that will answer the forums
Then break the turing ...
Ugh
It feels a bit forced to me
So what else?
tell me something
What do you have in mind?
Why do I write sentences in rows?
For that there is a point
It's easier to click on a pointer than a point
that make sense
It also seems more orderly
Less heavy
OK,
What else do you want to think about?
about nothing
Just be
Enough to think
Live life without thinking
Like an animal
Once there is something to think about, it will come alone
But what to do?
meditation?
I can do it
I can go to meditation
Or meditate at home
Or just sit and stare at something
I can stare at a TV screen
The advantage of meditation is that you stare inside
My inside is more interesting
Actually not sure
It's rather condescending to say
OK
So another idea?
I can stare at Candy Crash
It is also a form of occupational therapy
To spend life staring at Candy Crash
It's also an idea
Why not meditation?
What about a book?
This book is also not staring inside
If I want to stare inside, it must be in meditation
No alternative?
Is there anything you do and then stare inside?
I can go
Or run
That's an idea
Just hang out
You may also travel
Or ride a bicycle
Or fly
Or sex

I would be happy if I could go to sleep half an hour later
The problem is that I have to get up at half-past seven
Seven forty we'll say
Tchlas describe them takes ~ 5 minutes
Then I eat breakfast, and that's another 10 minutes
I can get up ten minutes later and eat at work
Or skip breakfast
Or take an energy snack
Then I can get up at 7:50
And go to bed at 12
This is an option
I liked

What else?
What else?
Enough leave me already
Take a walk
Do what you want
meditation
Just go
Maybe you'll run
Maybe run?
If you want to run
Put the sweater around your legs and run
What other options do I have?
I can go
Good
What are you telling?
What do you have in mind?
I feel it is
I have nothing in my head
Nothing moves me
What excites you?
sex
So do sex
But I want to have sex with other women
Like Cornefkes, you can not do the same thing every day
Sometimes you get a pita with chocolate
So where do we get out of here?
Just an exciting sex?
Sometimes I have thoughts that excite me
They're making my head a bit better
What do I do with the flight to Israel?
On the assumption I think only now that I did not let my head rest
I can not let my head rest when I sing here
I also can not do it in a cafe
Maybe that's a good reason to go for a walk
But for walking I can not go out with a computer
Or is it?
I can take a small bag with water and a computer
But then I can not run
You do not have to run
Well that's also an idea
What about the flight?
Do not know
How do I arrange everything I wrote here?
Can sentences be divided by subject?"

personal management.docx,"Then according to the best table will use wrike
I'm still debating
Really Wrike looks good
But a few things
Can I use it for work?
Can I use it for the project?
Can I use it with Shiran?

It's okay I guess to separate tasks from projects
To manage my projects I can either use GitLib or BitBakT
I do not know a free version of Python
Then for tasks one can stay with Apple's ""tasks.""

If I really work in BitBucket, then there are also two options:
Work with their usual issue tracker
Or work with jira
This JIRA is not bad at all, it came second in my lists

Another possibility was to use trac or build something of my own

All the latest options (JIRA Trac or build something alone) force me to pay on a monthly server

I think I will now try to deal with BitBucket's built-in service, and with ""tasks""


What is the cause?
I have a project let's say relocation
Inside there are sub-projects
For example, to make a credit card (the truth is that it is part of building credit)
Need to read a little about credit cards (say 5 documents - an hour)
To make a credit card I have to do comparing tickets
I have to compare tickets from my bank (4) to cards from several sites (say 20)
I have to do Excel and choose"
תובנות על העולם.docx,"For life a sun needs air, water, earth, or other life
Why Sun needs photosynthesis
Why do you need air - for oxygen
Why should water - for hydrogen
Why should land - for carbon
Four Elements

The water comes from the ocean, the ocean has a life, even without soil
So where did the carbon? Maybe from the bottom, or from the shore?
The water also evaporates but the air does not have carbon so there is no such life, although there is some carbon,
The water evaporates and moves inland, until you bump into the mountain, or warm enough to condense into the precipitation, and descend
In the mountains there is no life perhaps because there is little oxygen there, perhaps because the soil is not rich enough?
The water concentrates into valleys (and rivers to rivers) and flows back into the ocean. The valleys have a lot of life because of the balance of the elements.

Why did man house predatory animals?
For whom?
Were cats hunting for man?

Why these three elements?
1, 4, 6

The next-order order is proteins in carbohydrates and fats
Fat is the mantle
Protein is the skeleton
And the carbohydrate is the energy
It's a little like CSS and HTML css
Although another important part is dna which is the information
And the water

So it turns out that there are two other important elements: nitrogen and phosphorus

The fat consists of a hydrophilic part with oxygen and hydrogen and a hydrophobic part without oxygen
The hydrophobic part can also turn into carbohydrates that are carbon rings
The protein is composed in advance with a carbon side and nitrous side that can connect them, and a carbonic body with nitric acid, oxygen and a combination of both or none
The power of carbon is that it connects easily and breaks down easily, so it is the skeleton of many molecules
Oxygen is negatively charged
Nitrogen is positively charged


The elemental elements that make up the world are simply the god of metals."

Apparently there were few centers
It was better for each group to learn the language of the stronger group (with whom it might trade)
The centers began near rivers
do not know how
Abraham came from the Euphrates region and the Tigris came to Canaan and then went to Egypt
He really went through empires
But they were there before
How did they start?
Perhaps there were hunters and gatherers who used the hunting tools to take control of agricultural villages

So, for example, in the Bible, Abraham was Isaac, Jacob / Israel, his twelve sons, who became tribes, and Joseph, who descended to Egypt
After a few generations he was Moses, who brought the Israelites out of Egypt
It's just families that grew up, that's how it sounds

In the Prophet's Bible he chose King Saul and then David

I want to find a cafe where I can work
I want to work one day and not do anything one day
I prefer not to do anything on Shabbat
There are some problems with this
On Shabbat here everything is open, the first one closed
On Saturday I'm busy with a lot of things I have to do
I'd like to sit in a cafe, but talking to everyone on Skype from a cafe would feel strange"

What do I need to buy an apartment?
I'll read the book

Then you have to deal with the ongoing maintenance, find tenants, repairs, ...

So what is the luz?
Look for apartments
Make suggestions

Maybe I need more agents to have a comparison

enter - tainment.docx,"I do not know what entertainment is about?
Why do I want entertainment?
What is entertainment?
Entertainment - An event or action that provides interest or joy to the audience
Should there be a positive, is not a sad film entertaining?
Must there be an audience?
When I play soccer, am I entertained?
Could there be one person who was isolated? of course
And that's why I'm looking for entertainment, I'm looking for a positive feeling
I'm looking for interest
I'm looking for joy
What interests me
What makes me happy?
Why did I see Goldstar?
Because it's funny
What makes me laugh?
Why am I laughing?
Let's check out 9gag posts that made me laugh
A surprising new connection I had not thought of
insight
But not every new connection or funny insight,
For example, if I learn something new, I do not respond with a laugh,
Suppose I had an insight into the fact that entertainment is linked to a positive feeling and so I'm looking for it, it did not make me laugh
What is the difference between the discovery that entertainment is linked to a positive sense of connection between 2pac and 2pacca?
The second is a funny link - that is surprising, I did not expect him, I did not look for him, I respond to surprise
But not everything that surprises, funny, why 2pacca funny?
Why find that I forgot the wallet is not funny even that it's surprising
Well the truth is that it does not make me laugh, but it does make people laugh around me,
Because the effect of this on me is negative,
But if there was no negative effect, it was not that interesting, I would not laugh
Maybe there must be someone with whom this relationship has a negative influence so that I will be positively affected and laughed
Like for example that 2 pac would have been offended by this connection, or Chubka, I'm not sure
Or maybe the laughter is out of embarrassment ..."

Reward system.docx,"There are two signals:
Change (dopamine)
Sign (positive or negative) (opioid)

What is a positive sign? Lack of a negative sign
Actually we are constantly charged with a negative sign that our nerves are constantly shooting, either sitting on a chair, or lying in bed.
Once we get pleasure from these signs, a kind of numbness we feel good.

By that, when we're sure the bathroom does not feel anything, we're supposed to feel better than sex.
Perhaps because in the bath we only lose sense in the outer cells but not in the inner cells.

According to this under general anesthesia we are supposed to feel the best.
Perhaps because under anesthesia we anesthetize the area that feels (that receives this input)

According to this if we find that anesthesia is the whole body and not the brain we will feel the best.
Maybe because inside the brain is the mechanism that shoots all the time that it has a negative feeling and it does not stop shooting even when the body is asleep.

So if we find a way to silence him we can feel good all the time.
In general, this is what opioids do, but they create dependency.
Perhaps this dependence simply works out of good feeling over time.
Maybe that must change all the time.

So the mechanism is only negative, why are not living creatures committing suicide?
Because death is probably painful. Everything that brings us closer to death hurts us, and it teaches us that it is probably a painful death.

So we try to minimize the pain in our lives.
The problem is that the mechanism works in pulses, so to minimize pain we can only create pulses of ""joy"" (lack of pain)"

Investments.docx,"Investments
Why not invest 90% on the market, and 10% against it
Let’s say the market goes up each year by x%, and once every 10 year it goes down 50%
While the average is 10%
(1+x)^9*0.5=1.1^10
(1+x/1.1)^9=2.2
x =2.2^(1/9)*1.1-1=~0.2
In this case the portfolio earns 0.9*1.2+0.1*0.8=1.16 in the good years, and 0.9*0.5+0.1*2=0.65 in the bad year, instead of 1.2 in the good and 0.5 in the bad
I can even make it more stable by investing more against the market. Say I want steady 8%, that means x*1.2+(1-x)*0.8=0.8+0.4*x=1.08 x=0.7
Then in the bad year I get 0.7*0.5+0.3*2=0.95, which is not super bad
Generally, if the average is 10% then
x^9*y=1.1^10
9*ln(1+x)+ln(1-y)=10*ln(1.1)

The system of government is built in such a way that there is the executive and judicial branches of government
That the idea is to think about performing and criticizing, like any feedback system in nature
In addition, there is the press that criticizes
Does the judiciary really criticize? It is possible to sue those sitting in the government, or rather people are judged by the laws enacted by the legislature. This means that the enforcement of the law, if anyone passed by the judiciary declares a penalty
It seems to me illogical that there are so many rules
The press is in spite of the money, meaning that the newspaper is private and as such it must be profitable in order to exist
And the press shapes public opinion at a certain level

What do I mean, monkey talking
Can I talk to a computer?
Not really
but why?
Maybe it's better to die
There is no choice to make
There is no good and evil
You're just nothing ...
So why live?
Why does my body want to live?
inertia
Because until now only what he wanted to survive survived
Yes?
What is a will?
Everything that did actions that bring about his survival survived
More precisely what he did against his survival, extinct ...
An idea has the same effect
If an idea leads to its own extinction, it will not exist
An idea must feed itself
Like a gin must
The idea is mem
More precisely, it is an idea
An idea is also given to the characteristics of evolution: replication, mutation, and natural selection
We are controlled on the one hand by our genes and on the other by our ideas
What is an idea?
This idea, for example, democracy, the rule of the people, according to this idea governing the people should be carried out by the people
This is the way of good government
Is governance an idea in itself?
Yes, there is no obligation to have a government
What is Rule?
People's management system
An organizational system that determines how the people should act
Is the system an idea?
A system is a noun, which means a collection of bodies that function together
The human body has systems, even without anyone who invented this idea
So what is an idea?
Should an idea be an invention?
I suppose so,
Is invention an idea?
I guess these are close terms
The light bulb is an invention, but it's someone's idea
When the brain is an idea,
An idea is the potential for invention
Democracy is an invention? Yes, someone invented democracy,

Why do computers have no ideas?
An idea arises when there is a goal
Computers have no goals
If a target is set for the computer, will it have ideas?
For an idea there is a need for means
For the purpose of inventing the light bulb, the electric power, the conductive material, the chemical substances as an energy source, the sand (from which the glass was created) for preservation were empty.
If you have a number of means to the computer, and a problem, can it be solved?
It may even be through trial and error
But here I provide the problem
The problems arise naturally

What about words, man can invent words, but the word is not always an idea, it can be completely arbitrary.
So the idea of ​​presenting a certain order.

Can a computer understand?
What does it mean to understand?
What do I understand?
I understand Hebrew because I know enough words in Hebrew to understand the meaning of everyday speech in Hebrew

Here is an example of an idea:
Such as the bulb
Was it possible to know analytically that the passage of electrons in a thin enough string would create a sufficiently high current in the ultraviolet light range?
It must have been done by accident to know
Like most inventions, they were created by mistake
An idea like an algorithm for displaying search results
Can a computer surpass the Pike Rank algorithm?
Use of links as a measure of the importance of a search result
Can a computer invent metrics?
In fact a metric can be any feature
Can a computer find features?
A feature is actually a common factor for several organs,
Can a computer find features?


I feel like dying
Why all this
After all, if it's not for survival, then why
I do not feel like living
I also do not feel like dying
But I say if it's one thing, then why all this?
After all, in terms of minimum energy, it seems to me that we are in a minimum of energy when we die
And still there is a force that drives us to live
It is strange
As if the part of sex sounded like a logical explanation, we were looking to make sex, we had an urge to make sex, so there would be a continuation of the genes. The genes want continuity
But what is continuity in fact, and why do they want it
It's a kind of inertia
There is a law that says that without power the things remain at their current speed
I am from the rest that evolution also relies on a kind of inertia, in its law of culture,
It is not precisely inertia, but acceleration, and in front of it there is a force called natural selection
But is this minimum energy to be at a high speed from zero?
It sounds wrong physically
Perhaps the law is not an aspiration for a minimum of energy but for the minimal path between situations,
But what is the final situation?
How do we know how mass will behave? Or any material? He aspires to a minimum of energy, that is, women mass on a slope, she will strive downward because there is a body that pulls her down, that is, there is a body that creates a potential energy field, and the other body will strive to be at the minimum point possible,
Although in the absence of friction it will probably perform harmonic movement around the minimum
Energy is the potential to perform an action
Is it possible to teach a computer verbs?
I guess yes by video
This is the next step
I guess there are words we know without being taught
The simplest words, those that are difficult to define, because they are linked to the early knowledge we have in the brain, know that there is no need to define it
I assume that many concepts are abstractions, or the inclusion of other concepts
Some concepts were long before they were defined, such as energy and power

It's nice that I can write down here
Just to get things out so I can look at them
The problem is that I never look at what I wrote
The truth is I can do it now

It all begins when you believe
That is your premises
For example, the premise of capitalism is that human nature is competitiveness
So capitalism is the natural system
Whoever believes in it, undertakes that he believes in capitalism

But what if we say that this is indeed the natural method, but allowed man from the beast is the media that allows to balance competitiveness

If one violates a basic assumption, one may be substituted for one's faith
Unless he finds a deeper foundation assumption
Or feel betrayed and will not seek a deeper foundation


It's strange that it's harder for me not to do anything than to do nonsense
It's as if it's much easier for me to get input from outside than to listen to my inner input
There is some sort of energy or something here
Because in terms of energy expenditure when I do not do anything I am supposed to spend less energy than when I read something

Random injection mechanism:
* Read the configuration files
* Arranges randomly according to importance
Running mechanism:
* Runs the run command
Data entry mechanism:
* Follow the injection and write to DB

Result collection mechanism
* At the point in time the run files are collected (automatic files written at the end of a run) and data is collected from them: runtime, success, error, and written to DB



The situation of the mother is president or not president
I said it was fifty-fifty if I was right or not it was President or not
Although most likely it is not similar to the president
Then he said that 30 percent resembled the president
And then I told him that 30 percent of the imagination said 70 percent difference



The situation of the Ashkenazi versus Arabic
That

There was another point where I noticed that there is one reasonable possibility, and if not, the contrary possibility is reasonable


The situation of gays
There is a link between a number of cases
For the most part people are either gay or straight, few situations of me
And I asked why it was not as continuous as a normal distribution
Following one of the situations, I realized that this may be due to the existence of two factors with negative correlation
In the case of gays, the two variables may be sexual orientation and sex
There is a correlation between them, which means that most males are straight, but these are two independent variables
The current question is whether this does not refute the Central Border Law, which changes from the same segments.

It also raises the question of whether it is possible to be either selfish (capitalist) or social (communist) but not in the middle?

The situation I asked about the situation of Gestalt's understanding

So
Maslow's needs hierarchy: I need money for material things. I can produce them myself but it's less effective
Besides self-extraction
Do what I want
How do I get to the point where I make money in a way that requires the minimum
Or, better
How do I make money from my own exhaustion?
I do not quite know what my self-extract is

The most common words (more correctly the nouns) in this text are: idea, energy, computer and money.

What concerns me?
Money as part of my physical needs
Ideas as part of my ""spiritual"" (?) Need
A division between genes and water
Docings made a distinction between the two
But it seems to me that everything that works under the rules of evolution: culture, mutation and natural selection, carries out an evolutionary process.
It reminds me of the brink of lightning I saw today or yesterday
Lightning sends like metastases of plasma like a tree until it finds the shortest path to low (or counter) potential and then flows current.

What's sitting on my head?
It seems to me too much
I need to empty it a little maybe
I keep playing this game
Maybe to escape from day to day
What am I running away from?
Of all the decisions?

What decisions?
I do not have to decide too much right now
I am afraid of having children, and Shiran is stressed about it
I want to decide what to do with my life
I want to bring an idea, not a girlfriend, not money, as long as I have enough to survive I'm fine, 5 month is fine with me


Well then:
The most primitive brain I suppose just had to link eye, and muscle, he saw something he wanted turned there and walked in the direction
Such a thing can happen in the framework of a cell, with tails or whales like sperm, they do not need a brain
But when it comes to a number of cells, they need to be linked
There are cells that are directed to move, there are cells that are designed to sense
So the most primitive model I can think of is a brain, all it does is to convert sensory input into a muscle movement output (a movement directed at rotation, and perhaps a sequence of movements (by operating and relaxing) for walking (of course it is not a more realistic walk)
Is there more than that? Is this how I can explain a monkey?
Just input and output?
What about memory?
Okay if you get a feeling let's go hungry, it can move your body toward food only from the knowledge that once it brought me food
Because I'm thinking about hunger, and then I think about where I remember the food was, and then I take actions to get to where I remembered him
But how exactly does famine remind you? Because hunger is attached to the evidence of food where it was in the past, so it makes the body imagine it again as it saw before. The feeling from the stomach connects to the feeling of seeing and causes the body to imagine that it sees the food
Does he really see the food? Perhaps it is projected back into the eyes of the food?
What about sex?
Another need, how do I know what to eat and what to fuck?
Is this relationship innate or acquired? What about learning really?
Learning can be the creation of a relationship, just as I wrote about hunger, and the connection to the eye
With regard to sex, my desire to get close to a sex object can be the same as that of food, but Berga is close enough, another sense may distinguish the two, a sex object will drag a chain of different actions from the muscles.

What about speech? Speech connects animals, as a brain connects cells.

Of money:
In order to get as much as I put in the investment, I have to multiply between the years of savings and the annual yield.
So for a yield of 6% I need something like 11 years, at a yield of 6.5% enough for 10 years to be free
How do you make such a return?
There is a situation where it is possible
I have to take all investment options according to the solid model, and test them backwards, can not really fall this way
Of course, it is always possible to fall, the question of the chances, is it really possible to know the chances? Not sure, but need to drop and explore it to know.

So good if I want to learn to invest, how do I do it?
Basically to get a degree in economics I have to study macro, micro, game theory, and econometrics

Are we afraid?
Why can not we simply rely on the fact that if we give them citizenship (I do not know which one is preferable), will we manage to deal with the situation?
The truth is that if we are Israelis then we will not run because it is a democracy
But if we give them Palestinian citizenship? What will happen? They'll try what? To conquer us? And if they try? Will they succeed? Just give us an excuse to go back there with more strength

חשבתי על זה שאם להיות גיי זה גנטי, אז זה אמור אני מניח להתפלג גאוסית על כל ציר הנטייה המינית, הבעיה היא שאז היו אמורים להיות הרבה יותר אנשים שהם גם וגם, שנמשכים מעט לבנים ומעט לבנות,
אבל נראה לי שבאוכלובסיה היא לא בדיוק כזו, יש משהו כמו 90% סטרייטים, 10% גיי ומה שבינהם, כמעט כלום
ואז הבנתי שיכול להיות מצב שבו התפלגות גאוסית ועוד התפלגות גאוסית לא נותנת התפלגות גאוסית, לדוגמא במצב הבא, אם יש התפלגות גאוסית למשיכה לגברים והתפלגות גאוסית למשיכה לנשים, נפרדת, והמתאם בינהם הוא הפוך, אז באמת הרוב יהיו באחד הקצוות ולא באמצע,
אבל אז יש פה משהו מוזר, כי סכום של גאוסים אמור להתפלג גאוסית…
זה נכון במספרים גדולים, אבל עדיין

טוב אז ג'אול זה קילו כפול מטר לשניה בריבוע, כלומר מהירות בריבוע, כלומר זה האנרגיה שיש לכדור במשקל קילו כשהוא זז במהירות של מטר לשניה, שזה 3.6 קמ""ש
זה אומר שטכנית עם קילוקלוריה אחת יש לי 4200 ג'אול כלומר אני יכול להזיז ארבע טון למהירות של 3.6 קמ""ש
אז עם אלף קלוריות יש לי 4.2M ג'אול אני יכול להזיז 42 טון במהירות של 36 קמ""ש
אוקיי אפשר לחשוב בצעדים, כי בצעדים כל צעד צריך לדחוף גוף של 80 קילו במהירות של 3.5 קמש, אז כמה צעדים טכנית אפשר ללכת כדי לשרוף 1000 קלוריות?
כל צעד זה 80 ג'אול, אחרי 52 צעדים, יש לי קלוריה, כלומר 100 מטר, קלוריה, עם 1000 קלוריות אני יכול לצעוד 100 ק""מ, בלי בזבוזים, הרי הרבה הולך לאיברים אחרים
מבחינת שריפה, אני שורף 240 קלוריות בשעה בהליכה, נניח שאני הולך 3.5 ק""מ בשעה הזו , זה אומר 35 פעמים מאה מטר, 35 קלוריות היו אמוריות להעלם על התנועה, כנראה כתוצאה מבזבוזים שונים, התבזבזו עוד 200, במצב סטטי, שכיבה, וצפייה בטלויזיה, נשרפות 70 קלוריות, עדיין נשארו כ130 כבזבוז, ככל הנראה לחימום האוויר והקרקע, עדיין אפקטיביות גבוהה מאוד, היחס הוא של כעשירית
רכיבה על אופניים (סכ""הכ משקל נניח סביבות ה80 ק""ג) במהירות 36 קמ""ש שקולה 80*100 8 קילו ג'אול, שזה שתי קלוריות, אבל הצריכה היא של 1200 קלוריות לשעה, כלומר 20 לדקה ושליש לשניה, כל דיווש שליש קלוריה
עם קוט""ש אחד הוא 3.6M ג'אול, עם קוטש אחד אני יכול להזיז 36 טון במהירות של 36 קמ""ש (10 מ\ש), זה לא יאמן, זה המון אנרגיה, זה מזגן שפועל שעה, זה טלויזיה או נורה פתוחה 10 שעות, רכב חשמלי אפשר להזיז 7 ק""מ, נניח במהירות 70 קמש נקבל עשירית השעה, שש דקות, אז בשעה 10 קוט""ש
תכלס בשביל להזיז 3.6 טון במהירות של 36 קמ""ש (10 מ\ש) הייתי צריך עשירית הקוט""ש, ובשביל מהירות כפולה, הייתי צריך פי ארבע, כלומר 4 עשיריות, זאת אומרת שהנצילות פחות טובה כי היא כמה מאיות
בערך 860 קלוריות זה קוט""ש אחד,

If I build on live up to 120
Why that I have 120 years on 5000
5000 is 60000 per year, 120 times that of 7.2 million and about 2 million
But if I work for NIS 10,000 for 30 years and retire, then I'm all out, I've earned everything, which is 120 * 30, which is only NIS 3.6 million,

In a pension fund, this employee employs 5%
The employer adds 5% and another 8.33% on compensation
Then I get 50% of the income for good
That means I will get at the end of 18.33% * 30 = ~ 512% and then live from 50% for much more than ten years
Probably 30

I can theoretically earn twice as much and then go out at age 45
But then I have to pay for ages 45 - 60
Another fifty percent, that means a million and a half dollars
Not really
I can just leave the rest of the money aside and then pay myself at age 45

there's nothing to do
It really bothers my stomach ...
But do not feel I can talk about it
I do not really know what to do
So there is not much to be done in the meantime
I can sit with her for a talk
But I do not want to hurt her either
But I do not want to hurt either
Meanwhile my way is to go to the strip club?
Do not know
What are the options?
Stay with her and go to the strip club
Say goodbye to her and go to a strip club
Say goodbye and look for someone else
To stay and look for someone else
She's grown up, so it's a problem to leave I guess ...
The biological clock
I'm really at a loss
So in the meantime flows
But that's the way I'm leading her deeper
What to bring children without love?
Do not know
What is better
I do not want to hurt her
As if even if I were alone, what would I do?
I was looking for someone else?
who will?
It's not that it happens alone these things
Active need to start with girls
But there is a situation that just happens to happen again
As with Adi, after ten years I am about the same point
Yes, I enjoyed the way but it will end the same thing
So I can enjoy the way in strip clubs
Will it hurt the child?
I think if my parents were separated it would really bother me
The question of whether it would make me a less good person
As if on the one hand this explains Eyal a bit
On the other hand Berger is one of the best people I know
I do not think that divorce has really an adverse effect on a child's life ...
Whatever will be, I suppose
what can we do
What else?
So what do you want to go to strip clubs?
It's not really sex
I'm not really conquering the girl
It was a rather strange experience
I would have been very pleased if I had made her finish, the stripper
I guess I could
But it's hard to tell
So what's the idea of ​​going to strip clubs to make them finish and what then?
Is it fun for me?
what is missing?
Occupation?
Is not it enough to conquer her?
What is the occupation?
Does it calm the horniness?
I do not know
I guess I was horny when I got back
And it was only after sex that it fell to me
But not closed on it
As if it's quite true
I think I'm less horny now than I was
So in general it is not such a calming of the horniness
I suppose if I had gone all the way, then it would have calmed me down
So what's the difference between this and sex with the woman?
But it's already a betrayal
And that's problematic
The question is what is better
To betray and stay
Or go?
Or remain faithful and suffer
I guess it's better not to suffer ...
But then I cause suffering to the other side ...
The law of preserving suffering
What is the solution?
How do you minimize the suffering of both sides?
It seems to me that the option of betraying is the minimum suffering
As long as she does not know and I'm at peace with it
It's hard this thing
What else?
Do not know
I'm pretty much on it most of the time
It and financial independence
Another four years with God's help
And five years without him
mere
He's always there
Always have to be
I get to those 50 thousand
Another year I'm about 240
Two years on 320
Three by 400
Four on 500
Four or more months
And what then?
freedom
will see
So what's the plan?
There is no plan
Flow
Flow?
is that good?
Hard to say
Perhaps it is better goals goals plans
To get far
But where do I want to go?
I want to enjoy the way
Do not know where to go ...
What can I do?
Right now I'm putting aside 13 at 13 espp at 401k and what else? And another 13 in bonuses or rsu, that brings me to 40
I'm supposed to put aside a tenth of the salary
But it does not happen because I'm the only one who pays rent
So rsu I name 10 percent salary and employer name another 15% of it it generates 11.5%
I'm supposed to get a third
At 401k I name 9% and employer name a few? What a percentage of 6% I think he is supposed to do but does not close it
2 to 5 years he gives 75% from 6% it comes out 4.5%, a total of 13.5%
The RSU is about 20 per year, maybe a little more according to the bonuses, but after this tax we'll assume 13 thousand, which is less than 13%
The truth is that less than 10%, if I get 20 rsu and 130 salary, total 150, the 13th is about 8.6%
So we reached 11.5 + 13.5 + 8.5 = 33.5% which is exactly the third
It is strange
Because according to the plan I should also put another thousand
So something does not work out
12 thousand is 8%
Maybe because I do not consider the 15% and the salary when I calculate my salary
It raises it to me in 1.5% for the espp and 4.5% for the 401k,
So how much does it come out?
This is another 6%
So a third from 106% is 35%, it's still strange
I would expect to have 4 thousand to spend a month
Now I spend about 5
I get about 5.2 a month
The truth is I get 2.65 every two weeks
And there are 52 weeks a year, or 26 pairs
It comes out 69
After all downloads, and taxes
I put 10% of the proto in espp
I put 9% of the proto at 401k
The gross should be 128
That means another 24
Total 69 + 24 = 93
The bonus is another 20
But something like 7 came down
That means 93 + 13 = 106
Besides that there is also the 1.5 + 4.5 = 6% of the espp and 401k from the proto which is 128 it says another 8
Total after tax
So here's the oud a thousand a month
That means taxes do not really reach a third
But rather 44 out of something like 150, about 30%
And I have another 8 from the employer
Anyway I can work until age 40
Get to something like 5 a month but save the extra 1
So another one does not really help
2 a little better, truth 2 is enough
With 2 side I can be a millionaire up to 50
myself
And this should happen a little after my 40's, so I should have something like 720 thousand
In 480 I can big time retire
But the oud 240 makes a difference
Because they accumulate interest themselves
As we now see the end of 2024 I retire

Grandpa has a plan
What else?
Why am I trying to find ways to do more?
Because if I reach 20% I can retire within a year
Or within two years if I want 6
Besides it is computational learning
That's what interests me
So why not bots?
You can also bots
But things like that take longer
I want to exhaust the possibilities with investments
Give myself another month, say?
But what are the possibilities?
It's not possible to get all the information
It's really slow
I need to select important data
I can look at what Ben Graham looked at ...
See how much he has been earning by his strategy in the last ten years
See if there is a model that can get more than that
So what's the last attempt?
Great"

What happened to my head today I sat like in many last days like a zombie, yesterday I read an entire book, and a book is not easy, about genes because why it interested me you were a question I wanted to answer, or the concept selfish gene explained to me a lot of things mainly I remember that interested me about The idea, or maybe the concept is an idea What is a concept that I have achieved And now it is in my head or at least has representation of it In my mind, how did they come up with the idea of ​​evolution? If you still do not know exactly what life is, how physics knows whether to nose One has no clear idea of ​​what this material is, and this idea once you have an idea in mind you can explore it and dismantle it into components, but why dismantle the goal is not to build? This is the order of the order, it is the idea of ​​order that say awareness is the ability to arrange things to reduce entropy, where did the concept come from, this is a very common common feature, once there were people with lots of sheep and wanted to know who has more sheep, I think a better example is the number of people If they are three, and we are two, they have a greater chance of overcoming us. Maybe that is where the idea of ​​a number came from, or if we raised so much grain, and each one needs so and so, so the grain will suffice. That they have a notion of one's heart two and a lot, and that is their mathematics, with it more than two is a lot, the logic of logic is itself The Hokrht veracity of the indications regarding concepts as soon as you try to formulate a rule to make sense, you can check it out under your underlying premises, they are actually not only basic assumptions Concepts"
