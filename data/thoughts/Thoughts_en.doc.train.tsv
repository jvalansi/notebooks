Dear God I wanted you to know I know where you are, really it&#39;s interesting why I ask myself this all the time, it&#39;s a bit puzzling, this blind writing is nice to Allah but it&#39;s hard for me to believe that after that I&#39;m going to be a strictly blind writer, my dilemma is whether writing Somehow for thought I do not write as fast as I think, the speech was really a spin but I have a feeling that it is not as practical as the writing, the writing can be edited immediately and the speech can not, I can also just think for an hour, but also it is not so practical Because then I fall asleep, and what if I just walk down the street and think, I have too many stimuli, so I have to go where there are no people, but where there are no people, I live in the city, like in the book Zen the boy goes where he wants, that&#39;s how I want And I think about it because I think about my parents telling me it&#39;s dangerous to walk alone, not like the kid in the story, who barely had a paternal touch, and in the end he was murdered in a robbery, is it just, I do not know but I have a feeling he was hurt in the stomach, right where he is Always felt the psychosomatic pains, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a connection between length or lifestyle and how much you love, when you love you are happy when you radiate joy then love you , Like this girl from boxing, she&#39;s really cute, hurt by everything, she has a funny R. but she&#39;s really cute, and she&#39;s also a girl who looks around and notices me, because I have about a thousand and one men for three girls in the semester who are also worth something, so It&#39;s not a fair attitude I do not mean to fight, it seems to me especially unnecessary in the situation that every time I go out, I have a phone without starting with anyone, even though I really want to get who I want and not always who wants me, and that&#39;s the problem but more The dilemma I have is the fact that I think that if I try too hard ie go to this course (and pay 2000 NIS at least) I do not know if it pays off because in the end what they say it will be yourself, just totally mean do not be afraid of what she wants and try to be what That she expects but be you, do not change for her, be the man the leader so called, I have a lot of appreciation for leaders, it is the idea leader as it was written in my sister&#39;s book they do not need anyone to be next to them and that is why everyone wants to be next to them, it is such a thing Like they said to create attraction is to juggle between good and evil, between wanting and not wanting, I just think that if you are good to everyone, but not personally, then everyone will be good to you, because they are not Will think you&#39;re doing it for something, on the other hand there are all those who are anti and also they attract people, precisely because they are anti, maybe it&#39;s people with low self esteem, like Little and her girlfriend, but I do not want such negative people around anyway, How do I learn, it&#39;s a beautiful question, I thought it was all concepts because basically everything is questions but really I feel I have to go down with it in depth, I feel that the lowest or more correct most basic question is what I want, and I do not know what I want, And because of this I try to formulate basic assumptions such as causality which I can not completely agree on, (for example because it negates my ability to choose), but it shows a lot of logic, as well as statistics, it can also show a lot but is not binding, and all the more Kind of assumptions, so I went in the direction of evolution to try to figure out where the concept of desire comes from, or what the difference is between us living only acting on impulse instincts, even though I can&#39;t be sure of that either, and I end up concluding that I can not be sure of anything, so Just enjoying what I do, is the answer, but I want to do only what I want to do, and studying at the Technion I&#39;m not sure This is true, because culture directs me, and perhaps culture was created from the moment this creature called man had free time to think not only about what he must to survive, I mean his thought was not only gene-oriented, but also order-oriented perhaps, and he tried to conceive The world, to call everything in terms, so that his inner world will be the whole outer world so he can predict it better, has it succeeded so far we are progressing in the matter rather, we can predict the weather very nicely, and with that we have developed technology thanks to it for example we know Combustion brings energy that can be used to spin wheels that can be used to transport, and we can also turn a flow of electrons into information like this on a computer, and we also know how to route it into space and back to Earth to create communication and even more ... Internet, so good for us. The information to reality, and use it but why, so that we have more money, yes I feel I want money but why, so that I have a bigger house? Why? To have girls? So that I have a family so that my children will not miss anything to name it? Oh good question, I really like to solve questions or maybe ask them, like the historical dialectic driven by questions, how from the genes did we get to the questions, and if the gene is selfish, then why? I do not know what I wanted to ask, but there is some thesis about the selfish gene that I I did not quite understand, and the question is when did the gene stop controlling our lives, and why,? I understand the recursion in what survives is what is planned to survive or rather survives is who is the best in surviving, so why the gene and he is the only one who does it, how in the world Reached his developed level to replicate, fire also replicates so what&#39;s the point, what&#39;s special about the gardens? How did they not have competition, I usually notice that there is not much competition everyone does what suits him and in that he is the best, even though there is competition within the sex , I mean you&#39;re getting better because you&#39;re competing with yourself, and not with anyone else, understand? So the instinct still remains in us, the question is what do I do with everything I have written now, what is the idea in ordering it, what does it help me to order, why do I strive to order, do I strive to order or predict the future, or why? For harmony, what is it anyway? Was nice with the blind writing, but did you notice Jordan how did you not talk about sex most of this writing? Is not that what controls our lives, culture? I understand the theory of the selfish gene, only that in humans it feels a little less relevant, even though the leader, there is this aspiration that your influence will remain forever, your seal, but it seems to me it stems from how we attribute a positive emotion towards all those remembered, and even The ones I remember badly, inside face we appreciate, like Hitler my grandfather passed away, it&#39;s weird, I knew and saw that he would not last long but I also noticed that every time we were the whole family with him and he got a lot of love he suddenly felt better, right that too Related to drugs but is like I came to get him out of the bathroom, so after a night we were all with him and held him, that&#39;s how he felt better, that&#39;s how much love you get that&#39;s how you get stronger, I&#39;m from dad I did not get a lot of love, that&#39;s how I feel at least, It seems to me that a lot of negative people it&#39;s simply because they did not get much love, I do not really know how it goes but it&#39;s interesting, do what you most enjoy doing, so apart from fucking I also like to think, but I&#39;m just important to find what I want Or most like to do, when in fact this is what I do most of the time trying to answer, trying to look for answers, or connections also connections it from And an important mistake, it connects me to relationships, relationships between concepts, it&#39;s the contexts I&#39;m talking about, it connects me to language, how its structure starts from the verb and the noun and the relation and the name, or the concept, for example tree, the relation of the tree itself seems to come much later, I want to think how to study effectively, but why because I&#39;m at the Technion yes so what, why do I need something from the Technion why do I need the Technion, I just flow after what my friends did, enjoy you like to think, it&#39;s just that, it&#39;s to think, and a lot , So do it you have questions, you have problems, try to think about them, but then I do exactly what culture expects of me, you want to influence culture, that&#39;s what you do, through your thinking, what question do you want to answer? It does not matter, the Technion gives you tools, such as language, without language, how you would think, try to think without language, as in gibberish meditation, try to control your thought, can you really do it, what you think about when you think Except for food and sex, but masturbating is not the same as with a girl, oh I would like someone who&#39;s just flowing, someone to just fuck her whenever I want, because that&#39;s what&#39;s called fun, but they think about marriage, not like that, I&#39;m sure Not all of them, but they do not get tired after doing it once with a certain man, but why not, years of evolution have done their thing, all their eggs are bigger, but what a huge difference has happened, ha, and now there is evolutionary stability, it Nice this topic, they take theory, and what catches, stays, not like that, most of the time it will be a mistake but in the meantime it allows development, so take a basic hypothesis and test it, and if it is not correct, then proceed from it, but do not have this possibility or privilege to speculate Something and find out in the evening that it is not true, but what is true, there is no right is wrong, there is more or less true for example it is hard for me to imagine that someone could have predicted Einstein&#39;s theory before Newton, nothing And besides the concepts you define, although at the moment language is quite defined for me, then what concepts can I build die theories like for example mathematics, how do I know what I like?

That I do not think it is true	False
This is always the reason why to buy an apartment	False
This insurance	False
Suppose you buy a house in this country 4% at best, usually 3%	True
But suppose 4%	False
You rent at 6 thousand, a year it&#39;s 72, so a house costs 6 * 12 * 25 = 1.8 million	False
So you put on the 20% side it&#39;s about 350,000, which you would make 8% on	False
And a mortgage, which is pretty low, comes out to about the same money	False
So the main difference is the initial capital	False
That is about 30,000 shekels a year	False

There is a lot of demand here but there is also a lot of demand in the country.	False
But Sabba let&#39;s say she was working at that time	False
She would probably work in the country and then earn half of what she earns here.	False
But Sabba, let&#39;s say she worked here, she probably would have earned what she got in the jobs she did, which is about half of what I earn.	False
The claim I got half at first is inaccurate.	False
My base salary was about half, but in addition to that I also received bonuses and options that roughly double the income, which other places do not get.	False
But Sabba, suppose she was earning as much as I did, so basically she should get what I saved in three years as compensation	False
This is of course ridiculous	False
So half?	False

Maybe, maybe it&#39;s annoying	False
For the millionth time 170 income, 65 living, 65 savings, 40 tax	False
In total there should be more tax, it seems to me because it&#39;s just one income, so it is divided between the two of us	False
So now 230	False
Another year 230 + 65 + 23 = 320	False
Two more years + 65 + 32 = 420	False

Communism does not contain religion, but denies it	False
God	False

The one who contributes more earns more	False
Suppose there is a certain amount of money that is received, then the larger the portion distributed as a donation the larger the next amount will be	True
People will still consume now, that must, but less,	False
It is thus possible to normalize the distribution of income	False
The problem is that it requires a central system, and it never works	False
Maybe computing can do that, a system like Bitcoin	False
Maybe it&#39;s a normal distribution creature	False
Currently the distribution is abnormal	False
In communism a normal distribution such as a delta function (it is possible to register a delta function as normal with a standard deviation tending to zero)	False
The Gini index aspires to communism, only when everyone has equal income, the slope of the graph is fixed	False
For a normal distribution the slope will go up to the middle, and then it will fade away, because the decrease in the number of people fades faster than the amount increases (income increases linearly and cruises fade exponentially)	False
In capitalism the slope only increases, the income increases faster than the distribution fades	False
Is it not directly due to capitalism?	False
If I give free market, can I predict how income will be distributed?	False
Everyone takes raw material and turns it into something, and earns the difference between how much it cost him and how much he sells	False
Most often the raw material includes his personal talent, the price is determined by supply and demand	False
If the thing is rare and sought after its price is higher	False
Suppose a simple world	True
There are only 2 products, and two people, one produces food and two produces clothes	False
They can simply agree that one will produce the food for both of them and the other will supply the clothes	False
It is possible to determine that the time of food production is equal to the time of production of clothes, and then they simply change product after working the same amount of time	False
The problem starts when there are fewer types of consumer products, because then a certain product can take over a market and lead to a monopoly, and then capital is concentrated in one place, over a few people.	False
For example: housing, communications, money (bank), food, transportation,	False
The truth is that it&#39;s almost everything	False
In housing, everyone wants to live in Tel Aviv	False
In the truth media they put in competition (there are still only 3 big companies)	False
The money has 3 large banks	False
In food there is about one type of food company	False
There are also relatively few companies in transportation (and huge taxation)	False
There is nothing to do it also stems from the fact that we herd, tend to cluster around one product	False
Fermi Paradox -	False
If within the order of millions of years we are supposed to take over the entire universe given that it is free	False
So any culture that has emerged in the last billion years would have already appeared, it should happen in those million years, low chance of a collision between such events	False
The chance that two life forms will be created at the same time is like the chance that we will take 10 corn kernels and the first explosion will be of two kernels at the same time	False
For 100 nuclei the chance of two exploding together is low (rarely happens) and the difference between 2.5 minutes and a tenth of a second of the explosion is much lower than a thousand	False
The truth is that the ratio is pretty much the same, there are 100 nuclei and 600 tenths of a second in 1 minute, and there are 10000 suitable stars and the difference between a million and a billion is 1000	False
The chance that exactly the first of about 10000 explosions will be of two is not high, because it happens about one in 10	False
(Ten every million years, out of a billion that everyone &quot;explodes&quot;, at first it explodes every second or so, that means a 1 in 10 chance, it&#39;s about the amount, so maybe it&#39;s about 50 50)	False
Assuming a normal distribution it is like measuring 10,000 people, and that the two lowest will be about the same millimeter, or the highest	True
After all, this chance is certainly lower than the chance of taking just two people from the range where the heights are closer (around the average)	False
And around the average the chance is low, so sure it is lower at the edges	False
No matter how many people there are, the chances of me choosing two at the same height is nil	False
Although with 10000 in the same 1000 it should be quite common. The chance that this will not happen in a given second, is that each teen will do it separately,	False
If there are enough (say 10 ^ 10) then it is likely that the lowest are at the same height, because most people will be at the same height, then they are divided within a range of meters, but still the chance of taking two averages at exactly the same height is to my detriment,	False
Ok because it&#39;s not true it&#39;s not like choosing two at the same height, it&#39;s the chance of having someone at the same height for someone random, and that chance is actually high in the area around the average when there are a lot of people	False
In this world there is a billion and the chance of it is low, there is someone sure of my height, but the peak of the low is probably alone there, in most competitions the result is normally distributed, and the peak is one, most Guinness records are of normally distributed phenomena, and there is almost always one peak, and reasonable Assuming they represent all human beings, if there was someone better he probably would have tried, most people (at least in the western half) know the Guinness records	False
Conclusion Chances are there are no aliens	False
Walla	False
Puzzle:	False
Or with him the sum, or the difference of the other two	False
He knows that if one is listed 65 for the other X and the third is listed	False
Y = 65 +/- X	False

Y = 65 + X	False
It cannot be that X = Y	False
I want a situation where	False
Y = 65 - X	False
It will not happen	False
Suppose	True
Y = 65 - X	False
Then need a situation in it	True
Y = 65 + X	False
Can not exist, because Y = X	False
That&#39;s not going to happen either	False
Automatic tag retrieval	False

You can also divide the tags into groups, to see topics, and domains	False
It needs to find a hierarchy between tags, closeness between words	True
 	False
Because my brain is constantly processing it is simply its static state, there is a constant flow of energy to the brain, and if there is no input it is	False
What’s the idea?	False
Try to predict the next year’s indicators (gdp, company revenue, etc...)	True
This way there’s a game of governance	False
There’s many more stuff that’s hard to predict, like wars and stuff, but those should be sparse by nature	False

There&#39;s a situation I completely missed	False
But suppose 55%	False
A third interview was reasonable until he asked a code question, not complicated but due to time pressure I did not come up with an optimal solution	False

Maybe 40%	False

And we need to do couple therapy	True
And I have more things on the list	False
I also wanted to work on the investment strategy	False
The idea is to take what maximizes the historically low 5%	False
Because that&#39;s how they concluded that it was quite safe to attract 4% of S&amp;P	False
So maybe going for a strategy that maximizes it can increase the pace of attraction	False
The problem is that it usually does not indicate future results when there is not much history	False
So if I really want to find a good strategy I need a lot of data	True
Let&#39;s see if there is data	False
I can download with Yahoo	False

4 - 2 1 1, 1 2 1, 1 1 2	False
5 - 1 1 3, 1 2 2	False
6 - 1 1 4, 1 2 3, 2 2 2	False
7 - 1 1 5, 1 2 4, 1 3 3, 2 2 3	False
This too is pretty linear	False
In the middle there	False
15 - 1 4 10, 1 5 9, 1 6 8, 1 7 7, 2 3 10, 2 4 9, 2 5 8, 2 6 7, 3 3 9, 3 4 8, 3 5 7, 3 6 6, 4 4 7, 4 5 6, 5 5 5	False
But the combinations grow, if there is importance to order	False
And it increases according to the amount of options, although for 3 different numbers it is always the same amount of options to arrange	False
So that&#39;s not the point	False
It&#39;s pretty linear	False
If it&#39;s linear, then the 5% is in the 10% range it seems to me	False
Why because if I have a triangle, then 5% of the triangle is where?	False
If it was a right-angled triangle, then 5% is 10% that should be squared for space	False
Even if it&#39;s not a right-angled triangle I guess	False
Not really	False
If it is not a right angle then there is no resemblance	False
5% is 10% of the right half angle of the isosceles triangle	False
So that means	False
Wait then for a right angle of 10 length, if I take a piece of one length, let&#39;s say the height is h then the height of the piece is h / 10 then the area is h / 20 relative to the full area which is 10h / 2	True
So the ratio between the areas is 100, then a tenth becomes a hundred, the square because of the area	False
So 5% is 1/20 or 1/10 of the half, so to get to this ratio in the field, need together of a root of it in length, I mean _ about	True
But is that a third of the half?	False
Suppose the length is 40, then the length of the half is 20, then the area is 10h then the third is 13 and the area is 6h	True
So no, you need a third of the half, I mean a sixth, it&#39;s 7 and then the area is 1h = 3.5 * 0.35h which is a tenth of the half and five percent of everything	True
So need the amount instead of sixth	True
interesting	False
I wonder if it really works	False
I think the 4% comes from the fact that it&#39;s half the average percentage for the times when the market falls by half	False
Although order should not be important	False
If it fell in half sometime, it does not matter when	False
Or maybe it matters, because the rate of attraction is constant	False
So you want to earn long before this fall…	False
Do not know	False
Basically when I did the calculation for the S&amp;P now, I did not take into account the attraction, and reached around 4%	False
By and large it is always possible to withdraw 8% of the portfolio, the only question is where it went down	False
So what&#39;s the point of taking the low 5% or the 95% not to crash	False
If every decade there is one year of collapse, then there is a 10% chance of collapse, but a 90% increase	False
Suppose a 10% decrease of 50% and a 90% increase of 10%	True
Like currency,	False

Do not know	False
And what is the distribution of a sample in such a case?	False

Approximately yes, until he does not	False
This is another experiment	False
Just take the best Sharp ratio that year and leverage	False
I wonder what size loan I can take	False

On Sunday, the sleeping beauty retires to sleep. Before falling asleep, the experimenters tell her that they will wake her once or twice, depending on the result of a fair coin toss: if the result of the toss is a &quot;tree&quot; - then a beautiful tourist only on Monday. If &quot;Fly&quot; - it airs once on Monday and again on Tuesday. She is also informed that after each awakening she will receive a forget-me-not drug, which will erase the memory of the previous awakening, and will lower her again. When she wakes up the beauty is asked what is the degree of belief that the result of tossing the coin was a &quot;tree&quot;.	False
There are three options, that the result was a tree (H) and today a Monday (M), that the result was a fly (T) and today a Monday (M) or that the result was a fly (T) and today a Tuesday (T)	False

Q If we earn the same I do not know how much I will have to pay	False
It&#39;s by child custody time for sure	False
If it&#39;s half and half then probably nothing	False
But assuming 25% it means I will have to pay for the second part	False
Do not really know how it works	False
But if this child spends 3000 two children let&#39;s say 6000 I provide them with support a quarter of the time, I&#39;ll probably have to provide another quarter for the rest of the time	False

Assumptions:	False
The particle fits through the doorway with epsilon degrees wiggle room	False
This means that the probability that a particle that approaches the (center of the) doorway crosses it is (without the door itself), is epsilon/180	False
The door opens up to 90 degrees to one side only.	False
The door’s mass is negligible (does not change the course of the particle).	False
The probability to cross with the direction of the door:	False
Say there’s epsilon degree in which the ball can pass then the probability of a particle, that goes towards the door, to pass is epsilon/180 (probability that the ball is heading the right direction)	True
The probability to cross against the direction of the door:	False
Say there’s epsilon degree in which the ball can pass then the probability of a particle, that goes towards the door, to pass is epsilon/90 (probability that the door is sufficiently open) times epsilon/180 (probability  that the ball is heading the right direction)	True
In total there’s 90/epsilon times more chance that a particle will cross with the direction of the door than against it.	False
Inclusion and induction in the brain:	False
Generalization - When several neurons shoot together into the same neuron, the phenomenon is integrated into the same neuron, for example a neuron that symbolizes an auto-shot when it detects four wheels and a body, a neuron (or neurons) four wheels and a body neuron are integrated into one neuron	False
Induction - when we see only four wheels we will include in the car we will imagine that there is a body, even though the body&#39;s neuron did not fire at all	False
This is enough for the level of computation of a Turing machine (or Mada calculation)	False
Anyone with a brain can generalize and do induction (requires only 2 layers)	False

The whole brain thinks the same way, in patterns of time space, all the senses simply perceive changes in the environment and transmit them through the nerves, if it is light, then there is a nerve that perceives if there is more or less light, if it is a sound then there is a nerve that perceives the frequency of the sound, if It&#39;s the amount of food in the stomach that affects hunger, it&#39;s all patterns of changes in space and time, and patterns linked to each other, cat input will be characterized by pointed ears, &quot;meow&quot; sound and even without feeling it we will know its fur is pleasant to caress, but the basis of all is patterns of changes in space Time, there is always a transfer of information (we often ignore, the changes are the ones that usually catch the attention	False
These patterns are stored in memory but in a special way,	False
The memory is preserved in a certain sequence, it is not possible to see an overall picture straight, it is only possible to remember in the process, like a song, a character, a detail, every time a concept	False
Memory completes patterns, it receives information and completes it on its own, according to the input	False
What matters in the resulting patterns, is not the exact input but the relationship between the inputs, when we identify a person, we not only recognize that he has eyes and nose, we also recognize the distance between the eyes Proportion, and even if we look at him from a different light we will notice it is the same person,	False
Intelligence is the predictive ability of the brain, the ability to self-complete the received pattern, the brain constantly completes patterns of its input, and tries to predict from past memory the continuation of the input, what it is supposed to absorb, meaningful thinking is obtained only when there is a deviation from the desired pattern. Humor is built, for example, as soon as we get out of the routine line of thought, surprise makes us laugh, as a kind of recognition of the excitement we experienced), in us memory also controls behavior, behavior is a result of our prediction of what is supposed to happen, first we imagine the action.	False
Cortex action	False
The cortex consists of six layers, which information runs up and down, it rises upwards, and sifts the treatment, in order to reach maximum analysis, and in addition it goes down in the form of feedback, to predict its expectation, completion of the current pattern, and thus checks itself, if anything new , If there is something to learn, or where the situation is clear and familiar, the ahmash can also descend down the locomotor regions of the cortex and thus order an action appropriate to the current pattern.	False
Each region in the cortex works in pretty much the same way, it recognizes the pattern in the current input and passes it on, while sifting through the less important details, for each pattern or series, a group of organs it retains or gives a name, which it passes on	False
The hierarchy in the cortex represents the world, logic is in fact induction and deduction, understanding the pattern, or the relationship between things, building a whole from parts, and deduction, separating the whole into its parts, understanding about an individual from the whole	False
In the lower layer, all the input comes directly from the receptors, the nerves, ie the senses, when there are inputs that often come together, they continue on together to the next layer, and a generalization is formed between them, the next time only some of the inputs are supposed to appear together, the cortex already knew to complete the picture. And every time these inputs appear again and again together, the connections are strengthened, and our predictive power increases, grouping inputs together is actually giving a name or conceptualization of a phenomenon, as for example connecting input of stem with leaves gives the concept of wood, or connection of sound tax gives the concept Tune, once the prediction is wrong, it is necessary to investigate the matter, break it down into components or look for different patterns	False
The action is part of thinking, it is simply continuing processing through the nerves related to the position of the body at any given moment, for example when in the corner of the eye we have a feeling of bone growing rapidly i.e. approaching, instinctively defending ourselves from this direction because we already know the pattern. Quickly, it will probably hurt, but even non-instinctive stunts work similarly	False
Learning is done so that at each stage the processing is done at the lower levels of the cortex, for example speech, first syllable separation is the main occupation of the cortex, then word separation, word imitation, sentence construction, etc., so in adulthood, syllable separation is done with almost input.	False
The short-term memory, the new memory, is in the hippocampus, when there is input that does not fit into any template, oh is stored in the hippocampus for immediate use, but if it is not needed, it will be lost as soon as such new information arrives	True
The thalamus receives the information that needs to be focused on at that moment	True
Intelligence is actually the ability to predict and remember and it has existed since the dawn of life, as the basic operation of the cell, which is separated from the outside, but receives information from it and uses it (for reproduction, for food ...)	False
The next step was the ability to change the predictive and memory abilities during life, which means that it is not only a genetic charge but is also affected by the environment.	False
The last ability is the ability to create concepts, or names as a substitute for direct learning, this is the mediation known to certain species of animals, but performed in a much stronger way in humans	False
Creativity is openness to patterns, meaning a repeated attempt to understand or challenge existing patterns, when we are not committed to the pattern, we do not work in stereotypes and are able to come up with a completely new approach to sustain	False
Awareness is actually the total declarative memories, conceptualized in us, that is, things we can talk about, if we erase a person&#39;s memory of a particular day, that is, return his mind to the exact state he was in the day before, then he will be sure that the past day did not exist at all. For he was unaware of his deeds the day before, though when he had done them he was fully aware of it,	False
Consciousness is the ability to concentrate or tune in to certain things, free will	False
Imagination is the patterns we create in our heads, even when there is no complete picture we are able to complete it in our imagination, and when we only think of a certain concept we are able to go into it in great detail as if it existed	False
I want my own office	False
But he will have to be able to do the rest with everyone else	False

I guess both are. That’s why I’m dividing my free time in 2, one part for fun (3/21 parts of the week) and one part for work (4/21 parts of the week)	False
So for fun I should only care about fun, not satisfaction. If that’s the case I should go to strippers. 	False

Three dimensional Image display, using laser projection.	False
Invention Background:	False
_        Stereoscopic 3D displays show a different image to each eye	False
_        Auto stereoscopic 3D displays do this without the need for any special glasses or other head gear. within this type, there are several methods, such as:	True
o       Flat Panel device:	False
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ A lenticular lens is an array of magnifying lenses, designed so that when viewed from slightly different angles, different images are magnified.	False
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ A parallax barrier, consists of a layer of material with a series of precision slots, allowing each eye to see a different set of pixels, so creating a sense of depth through parallax. A disadvantage of both technologies is that the viewer must be positioned in a well defined spot to experience the 3D effect.	False
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ Eye tracking device, that automatically adjust the displayed images to follow the viewer_s eyes as they move their head, only suitable for one person.	False
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ Holographic 3D displays: reproduce a light field which is identical to that which emanated from the original scene	False
o       Volumetric displays, where some physical mechanism is used to display points of light within a volume. Such displays use Voxels instead of pixels.	False
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ multiplanar displays, which have multiple display planes stacked up	False
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ A swept-volume display: the three-dimensional image is formed by illuminating a rapidly moving display surface, which may be a spinning diffuser. Typical schemes use a circular screen rotating at about 900 rpm, which sweeps a spherical volume at each half-rotation.	False
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ Static volume: In the simplest case, an addressable volume of space is created out of active elements that are transparent in the off state but are either opaque or luminous in the on state. When the elements or voxels are activated they show a solid pattern within the space of the display.	False
This Invention is based on the auto stereoscopic, volumetric display, with no need of any special device to view the image, and by displaying the image _as is, and can be viewed from all directions, unlike the flat panel.	True
 	False
Abstract:	False
The device uses lasers with sufficient amout of energy, that it_s light course is seen duo to the existence of impurities in the sorrounding air. by spreding the Laser beam, through a mirror or a lens, thus making it less powerfull so it would not be seen to the viewer, and using a second mirror or lens to focus it to one single point, making it a single voxel in the air, no oother medium needed.	True
the device consists of many rows of this kind of laser projection, to creat a whole screen, and creating several screens one behind the other, to create a three dimentional image, layer by layer.	False
there is a possibility to use rotating mirrors to create a scan, not projecting all the lasers at once, but projecting the laser through several lenses or mirrors on a high frequency.	False
 	False
 	False
 	False

By naming things, so that we can contain them in our imagination	False
When we gave a concept for the good feeling, when we invented the concept &quot;good&quot; and therefore also &quot;bad&quot;, here we set the goal of culture, the goal of course is to avoid &quot;bad&quot; and as much as possible &quot;good&quot;	False
Joy and Ozer are just words that describe a good feeling	False
Love is a good feeling when its object is external	False
But basically what is a good feeling, it is impossible to define a concept in the concept itself, so a good feeling is actually a feeling that we would like to exist all the time, that is, its very existence we want to maximize,	False
This feeling is an interpretation of the senses, the senses perceive and so we feel, although there is also a feeling in the brain, I mean love is not exactly received in the senses, but it is an interpretation, so it goes into definition, it is just a meta interpretation, so when our senses, I find it difficult to say It limits them, but basically when the interpretation is positive we feel good,	False

There is a very good chance that before the concept of good existed there was already the concept of bad, because bad is the generalization of our passions, hunger thirsts horny, not that they themselves are bad but they make us feel bad, when I am hungry then it bothers me until I satisfy myself, When I&#39;m horny it bothers me until I satisfy this hunger, the same with breathing, we only feel when the need is not met, I&#39;m not sure sex feels as good as it feels bad without it, although it seems to me that sex is a bit unusual in this respect because it does not feel good to breathe , Or drinking just hurts us when not, and pain is the motive, maybe the strongest as he said in the lecture to the lecturer there is nothing that motivates more than the hanging rope or something like that, even sleep, maybe there are those who do it for fun, but usually it is done out of lack of choice	True

Right now looks like I can make it to 600k in 5 years, 700k in 6, 850 in 7 and 1M in 8	False
But I think I’ll retire in 5, and then take a year off or something to see how that is.	False
I think after retiring I’ll still make money, because I’ll be productive	False
So it’s a bit less than 5 years, 4 and 8 months right now until I’m 29	False

I’m getting 40k a year (before taxes) from the bonus, meaning around 26k net, and then 18k from 401k, and 11.5% ~= 14.5k before tax which is 10k net from espp, total of 54k saving	False
133k+40k=173k, 	False
Tax ~50k, saving ~54k, spending 70? I’m probably spending a bit more than 60, so saving is maybe 1k more (last year I earned ~150k, so i didn’t save that 10k, but maybe this year)	False

Maybe because inside the brain is the mechanism that constantly fires that simulates a negative feeling and it does not stop firing even when the body is asleep.	False
So if we find a way to silence him we can feel good all the time.	False
By and large this is what opioids do, but they create dependency.	False
Maybe dependence is just an outgrowth of a good feeling over time.	False
Maybe because you have to change all the time.	False

Come on what comes to mind today I sat like many last days like a zombie, yesterday I read a whole book, and not an easy book, about the genes why because it interested me I had a question I wanted to answer, or the concept of selfish gene explained me a lot mainly I remember interested me about Memes, why because I try to understand what attracts in learning what sets us apart from the rest and in my opinion the answer to this matter is the concept &quot;concept&quot;, the idea or maybe actually the concept is an idea what is a concept, I got it and now it is in my head or at least has its representation In my head how they came up with the idea of evolution if you still do not know what exactly life is, how do you know physics if no one has a clear idea what matter is, it is the idea once you have an idea in your head you can explore it and break it down into components but why Not build? It&#39;s order, it&#39;s the idea of order they say that awareness is the ability to arrange things to reduce entropy, where did the concept of number come from, it&#39;s a very common feature, there used to be people with a lot of sheep and wanted to know who has more sheep. If they are three and we two have a better chance of overcoming us, maybe that&#39;s where the idea of a number came from or if we grew so and so grain and everyone needed so and so, then the grain will suffice for this and so time, number is a generalization of quantity, which is a concept in itself there are tribes That they have one my heart concept two and a lot, and that&#39;s it their math, with that more than two it&#39;s a lot, the theory of logic which itself investigates the truths of indications about concepts once you try to formulate a rule to make order, you can test it by your assumptions Assumptions but concepts	True

I register only because of the sign from the rose, which did not close immediately, after I remembered to keep most of the roses I closed earlier, I did not close the acronym and in fact I did not save any changes.	False
So I apologize in advance if it&#39;s retarded	False
Okay this is a lack of confidence that comes after you&#39;re sure you&#39;ve got something big	False
And that&#39;s exactly the wave I&#39;m talking about,	False
Everything is a wave in our thinking as well	False
The wave that goes up when we are creatively unique and goes down when we want to be like everyone else to communicate with everyone,	False
When people try to be too creative then they push it too much digging into what is called as I do now, so they also fall deep back into insecurity	False
The way to get to the Equal Valley is to trust the name to do what it needs to do, and then get to the resonant frequency and not try too hard and on the other hand try not to be like everyone else too much (this is what leads to insecurity	True
It also reminds me of the theory that everyone&#39;s size is 1 and only our projection on culture varies from one to another, but those whose projection on culture is low are the ones who can pull the so-called highest string, dig the deepest in their resonance	False
To release is to flow, and to pull at that string on the one hand to try to dig to reach some conclusion that will shock the world from selfish ego pride and on the other hand it is this side of culture to be very cultural in thinking	False
It&#39;s weird because when you release you become the most creative, but when you pull the string it&#39;s because you try to be the most creative	False
So release my brother stop writing, in resuscitation	False
 	False
Well, it&#39;s hard for me to shake off this desire to write, which seems to me to come from the desire to live forever, or create something that will stay after, like the urge to have a child, which comes because it&#39;s better for survival, so culture bastardizes those who remember forever, Because it is better for the survival of the culture	False
The ones who are remembered the farthest are the ones who lay the foundations of culture, in our society it is Abraham Moses Jesus, and also Socrates Plato Aristotle, all these are philosophers, I am not sure everyone knows who they are, our culture is instant meaning the heroes are living now, or not Long ago, like the Beatles or Britney Spears	False
They sacrifice the high climb in the cultural strings, meaning they sacrifice influence in favor of popularity, they could have been higher and more influential if they had not sought the material, because that&#39;s how it is, it&#39;s like two opposites feeding each other, the material and the spirit, you ascend spiritually and then With your impact you can get more material	False
Sometimes you want to give up eternal life to get more now, and sometimes the other way around	False
I unload the stella a bit	False
The law of paradox: A certain choice is correct if the other choice leads to a paradox	False
For example if I believe that in order to develop a theory I have to let go and not try to develop it by force, then the only option is to let go, because if I want to develop the theory I have to let go, because the theory says that is how I will develop it, and on the other hand if I do not want to develop it then I will release anyway	False
Or if you believe that in order to get a girl you have to release then the only option is to release, because if you want her then you have to release, and if you do not want her then you will release anyway	False
On the other hand one should not believe in these beliefs in the first place	False
Connects me here to the theory that women are the second class after leaders and before leaders	True
The more indifferent a man is to women in the short term the more women he will have in the long run, the more indifferent he is the more philosophical, or something like that the more he influences culture he is more a leader, on the other hand the more conformist to culture he is less sought after, he is more controlled By the women, but he has more friends	False
It&#39;s a little weird how these theories come up after I smoke no?	False
Another point: every contrast is something that also has a contrast, for example animal and cultural are opposites but both are opposite of indifference	False
How do I know what&#39;s right?	False
What I decide	False
I have a feeling I&#39;m just deciding when to release, I mean if I dig something, I can just decide to stop or continue, if I continue I&#39;m stretching the string	False
The most influential in the culture are those who have pulled the string the farthest, and released	False

We can’t tell anything to the sensors. What happens if we do the same with neurons?	False
I don’t think there’s currently a way to activate single neurons.	False
I wonder if that’s important, what if we activate a large number of neurons?	False
What is the level of activation we can achieve today?	False
If I want a 2 way communication without touching any neurons, that by using muscles. What are some disposable muscles in the body?	False
So what about a machine that helps me play chess by using the pinky?	False
What is the resolution of thought? I probably have tons of neurons going to and from my pinky. If I use them to communicate to a neural network, what happens?	False
What now?	False

I have ±160k right now. I should have 200 by next May, 300 by the following July 400 by the following august, 500 the year after that, and 600 the year after that. That’s a year before I’m 40, hopefully, if everything goes well.	False
If I get a job that pays 300k, I get 200k, still living on 60k, saving 140k, that’s like saving 2.3 times more. I should get to 600 in 2-3 years from now. So that’s 2 years difference. Almost half the time. Which is nice.	False
