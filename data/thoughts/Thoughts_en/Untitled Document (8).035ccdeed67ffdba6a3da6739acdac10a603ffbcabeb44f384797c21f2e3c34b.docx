If you want to address inequality you just have to open schools that teach code
The problem is that the range to profitability is really long
At least 12 years
Maybe enough from high school
Then it&#39;s 6
Still a lot
Although most startups talk about such a range
This is not a startup
But it can be
What about an online school
To learn code there is the Litcode
Why not do Litcode
Why does such racism bother me?
Because it&#39;s full of news
But it&#39;s not just racism
It is also related to education
Everyone should have the same starting point, it&#39;s good for the economy too

If I spend $ 50 a month
It&#39;s 50 * 12 a year
If I do 12 percent, it&#39;s like one percent a month
So I need 50 * 100 for it
$ 5,000
It&#39;s another it&#39;s another month of work or so
Do not know if it is worth it
I also do not do 12%
Maybe half of it
Then it&#39;s two months of work
30 days for 40 years of 12 days of freedom
What a 500 day
Equal?
Do not know
I will not have to retire because I will probably be home alone most of the time
Shorter does not know if I would work two months for it
How much would I work for it?
A safe day
Week, it seems to me yes
Month do not know
A year seems to me not
And what about a prostitute?
Whore this month is another year or so
sounds logical
And what about porn is another half year
It also seems to me a spin
This is my hobby

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
All is well
What about you?
On the roof I can talk to myself
Also in the hotel room
Well let&#39;s do it
Too bad I do not have an iPad and charger
