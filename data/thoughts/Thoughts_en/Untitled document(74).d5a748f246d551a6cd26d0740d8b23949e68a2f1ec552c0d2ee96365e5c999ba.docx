If I have endless money what do I do?
What do I do if money is not personal
What did I like to do most as a child?
Watch TV and play on the computer

Maybe I would make a model who knows how to play civilization

Maybe traveling to the Caribbean

Maybe

Why is it so hard to know what I want?
This is supposed to be the easiest thing in the world

Like I wanted to fuck
I pretty much know that
I tried with an escort girl
There was nothing
She was not worth it, and worse she was not really interested

Anyway if I feel like it
that is not a problem
$ 400 and I did it
It&#39;s quite a bit
But it makes sense
I can also travel to Colombia and do it a lot cheaper
Maybe when I retire and have more free time

Maybe kids at all is the thing
It fills life
Maybe

Good
But what in the meantime?
Waiting for retirement?
for children?

I do not know what I want
If Sheeran had not been here I would probably go to some escort girl or something
But Sheeran
So maybe tomorrow will be sex
Which is also a spin
And in the meantime?
Do not know
What most people do in their spare time

TV
Friends
computer
Books
sport
is nothing
Other things - trips
