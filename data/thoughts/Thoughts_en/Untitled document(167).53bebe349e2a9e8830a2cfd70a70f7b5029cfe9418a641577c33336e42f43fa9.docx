I want to know when I can retire
By and large I get 1300 from ESPP and 1300 from 401k and 1300 in RSUs (or 20k a year before tax)
So that pretty much closes the 4000 for me in a month of savings
I can add another 500 or even 1000 here if I live in a more normal place


According to the standard deviation and expectation of this profit came out between 8-12 years
