What&#39;s going on?
All is well
What&#39;s new?
Not too much
I pretty much got what I needed at work
This is a milestone
But what else?
What about life itself?
Maybe I should just submit a client to Naorlink
It would be cool to work there
Probably less money
I need to read the article
I find it hard to believe that a neuron would really need to be connected
I think if we can connect to Corpus Closus it will be enough
Just add another brain
Good
What else?
I do not know what I want
Maybe play on the computer
