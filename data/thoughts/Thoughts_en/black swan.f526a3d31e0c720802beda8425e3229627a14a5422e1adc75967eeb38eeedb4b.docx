extremistan: a system in which low probability event is proportional to a power of it's size (power law) 
mostly cultural systems (economy, politics...) but also the weather
weather can be forcasted to some level using numerical results of the primitive equations (like momentum conservation, energy conservation, flow continuity...) along with noble gas law.
 what if we can find same equations for culture, or information
for information I believe that it could be treated with statistical rules applied to statistical mechanics, using terms like enthropy
