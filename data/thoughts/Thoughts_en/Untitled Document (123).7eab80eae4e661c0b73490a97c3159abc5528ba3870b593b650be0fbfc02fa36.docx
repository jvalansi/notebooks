Walk does not know
Tango is going to die

carcinogenic
In the stomach
How does a dog get stomach cancer?
All my grandparents had cancer
I probably will too if nothing kills me firstâ€¦

I&#39;m spending a lot of my life at work right now
Constantly chasing the hazelnut
I need to plan the hazelnut instead
I&#39;m sure I can save a day a week like this
A day for braces or personal projects

I have missions, radars, emails and a calendar
Best if I could unite everything
In short everything has to be done through radars, won the most orderly
If it&#39;s not a mission of the moment, it&#39;s worth having a radar
