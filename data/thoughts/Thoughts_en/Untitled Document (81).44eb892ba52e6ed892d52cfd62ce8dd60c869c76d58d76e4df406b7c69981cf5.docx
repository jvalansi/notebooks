A program to study for an interview from Machine Lerning
Five sites
Every day solve a question
Repeat Andrew&#39;s courses

There are between 100 and 1000 computational learning questions, and between 10 and 100 language processing questions
How many questions to ask?
I have 4 weeks and Christmas
What will I do at Christmas?
When will I go on holiday after Christmas?
Maybe around April for a week

One question each day will amount to 4 weeks * 5 days, 20 questions
You have to ask 5 questions a day to reach 100
Each question 20 d, that means ~ two hours a day
Or you can do a few questions per hour
That should be enough
It&#39;s 20 hours
3 weeks for computational learning and last week for language processing
Besides doing Andrew&#39;s preparatory course
It&#39;s 10 weeks, every week five hours, I can do a lesson on a busy day, or two days, or just an hour a day and then it will really take 10 weeks.

What about my project?
Is more important
Need to keep working on it
But how much more?
At the moment he is not really giving results
Although there seems to be something there
It is not yet entirely clear
There is still a lot of work to be done
The question is how much work to put into it
I also have the option to identify good stocks using xgboost
There is also an option to go through a project
I just have to decide when it&#39;s enough

So for Andrew&#39;s course, if I want to finish by the end of the year, I have to give 50 hours in 4 weeks.
That means 12 hours a week, that&#39;s 3 hours 4 times,
I have to finish two and a half weeks a week, that&#39;s a lot
What about the project then…
I can postpone it for a month…

But I have to decide when enough
I have invested in this project full time, if all the attempts before (of deepmoney) are included

What do I do with all the emails?
What about all the bookmarks?
What about the tasks?

I need to think of potential benefit
On the one hand I waste time
On the other hand, what will I do at this time?
With all the planning I have already closed next year

I have 3 things to do a day, 21 a week, half (10) I work, another 5 I work on my stuff, another 5 for Sheeran.
I do not have such free time.
You can change it to 3 for work on things, 3 for free and 4 for Sheeran

I go through the emails every day on the return trip, I also need to start reading an article
I need to clear the tasks as well

What to clean?
This job is a list of tasks, radars, emails and bookmarks
This house has a to-do list, asana tasks, emails and bookmarks

In short, everything should be in one place
Probably in something like radar or asana
The problem is that I do not have a component of my own on the radar, my private tasks have no place
Vasana is also not a tool either,
The emails should become tasks, the bookmarks I try to read once a day… one private one of the work
The problem is that emails usually have something to read before I get to it
Private tasks should also aspire to be in project management tools
I can give Jira a chance I guess, but I do not think it will completely replace, neither the emails nor the tasks nor the bookmarks…
