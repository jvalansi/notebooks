At the moment it seems that even if I had bought all the shares from 2003, I would have earned an average of 8 percent in the quarter.
This is crazy, and does not make sense.

And what does that mean standard deviation
That means it could be that next quarter, instead of going up eight, it could go down eight.

The p / e does not really improve, it is no better than the forecast, and no better than just betting on everything.
