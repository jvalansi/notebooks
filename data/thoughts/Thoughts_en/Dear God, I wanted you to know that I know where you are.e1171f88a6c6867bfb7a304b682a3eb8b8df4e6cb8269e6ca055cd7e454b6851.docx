Dear God I wanted you to know I know where you are, really it&#39;s interesting why I ask myself this all the time, it&#39;s a bit puzzling, this blind writing is nice to Allah but it&#39;s hard for me to believe that after that I&#39;m going to be a strictly blind writer, my dilemma is whether writing Somehow for thought I do not write as fast as I think, the speech was really a spin but I have a feeling that it is not as practical as the writing, the writing can be edited immediately and the speech can not, I can also just think for an hour, but also it is not so practical Because then I fall asleep, and what if I just walk down the street and think, I have too many stimuli, so I have to go where there are no people, but where there are no people, I live in the city, like in the book Zen the boy goes where he wants, that&#39;s how I want And I think about it because I think about my parents telling me it&#39;s dangerous to walk alone, not like the kid in the story, who barely had a paternal touch, and in the end he was murdered in a robbery, is it just, I do not know but I have a feeling he was hurt in the stomach, right where he is Always felt the psychosomatic pains, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a connection between length or lifestyle and how much you love, when you love you are happy when you radiate joy then love you , Like this girl from boxing, she&#39;s really cute, hurt by everything, she has a funny R. but she&#39;s really cute, and she&#39;s also a girl who looks around and notices me, because I have about a thousand and one men for three girls in the semester who are also worth something, so It&#39;s not a fair attitude I do not mean to fight, it seems to me especially unnecessary in the situation that every time I go out, I have a phone without starting with anyone, even though I really want to get who I want and not always who wants me, and that&#39;s the problem but more The dilemma I have is the fact that I think that if I try too hard ie go to this course (and pay 2000 NIS at least) I do not know if it pays off because in the end what they say it will be yourself, just totally mean do not be afraid of what she wants and try to be what That she expects but be you, do not change for her, be the man the leader so called, I have a lot of appreciation for leaders, it is the idea leader as it was written in my sister&#39;s book they do not need anyone to be next to them and that is why everyone wants to be next to them, it is such a thing Like they said to create attraction is to juggle between good and evil, between wanting and not wanting, I just think that if you are good to everyone, but not personally, then everyone will be good to you, because they are not Will think you&#39;re doing it for something, on the other hand there are all those who are anti and also they attract people, precisely because they are anti, maybe it&#39;s people with low self esteem, like Little and her girlfriend, but I do not want such negative people around anyway, How do I learn, it&#39;s a beautiful question, I thought it was all concepts because basically everything is questions but really I feel I have to go down with it in depth, I feel that the lowest or more correct most basic question is what I want, and I do not know what I want, And because of this I try to formulate basic assumptions such as causality which I can not completely agree on, (for example because it negates my ability to choose), but it shows a lot of logic, as well as statistics, it can also show a lot but is not binding, and all the more Kind of assumptions, so I went in the direction of evolution to try to figure out where the concept of desire comes from, or what the difference is between us living only acting on impulse instincts, even though I can&#39;t be sure of that either, and I end up concluding that I can not be sure of anything, so Just enjoying what I do, is the answer, but I want to do only what I want to do, and studying at the Technion I&#39;m not sure This is true, because culture directs me, and perhaps culture was created from the moment this creature called man had free time to think not only about what he must to survive, I mean his thought was not only gene-oriented, but also order-oriented perhaps, and he tried to conceive The world, to call everything in terms, so that his inner world will be the whole outer world so he can predict it better, has it succeeded so far we are progressing in the matter rather, we can predict the weather very nicely, and with that we have developed technology thanks to it for example we know Combustion brings energy that can be used to spin wheels that can be used to transport, and we can also turn a flow of electrons into information like this on a computer, and we also know how to route it into space and back to Earth to create communication and even more ... Internet, so good for us. The information to reality, and use it but why, so that we have more money, yes I feel I want money but why, so that I have a bigger house? Why? To have girls? So that I have a family so that my children will not miss anything to name it? Oh good question, I really like to solve questions or maybe ask them, like the historical dialectic driven by questions, how from the genes did we get to the questions, and if the gene is selfish, then why? I do not know what I wanted to ask, but there is some thesis about the selfish gene that I I did not quite understand, and the question is when did the gene stop controlling our lives, and why,? I understand the recursion in what survives is what is planned to survive or rather survives is who is the best in surviving, so why the gene and he is the only one who does it, how in the world Reached his developed level to replicate, fire also replicates so what&#39;s the point, what&#39;s special about the gardens? How did they not have competition, I usually notice that there is not much competition everyone does what suits him and in that he is the best, even though there is competition within the sex , I mean you&#39;re getting better because you&#39;re competing with yourself, and not with anyone else, understand? So the instinct still remains in us, the question is what do I do with everything I have written now, what is the idea in ordering it, what does it help me to order, why do I strive to order, do I strive to order or predict the future, or why? For harmony, what is it anyway? Was nice with the blind writing, but did you notice Jordan how did you not talk about sex most of this writing? Is not that what controls our lives, culture? I understand the theory of the selfish gene, only that in humans it feels a little less relevant, even though the leader, there is this aspiration that your influence will remain forever, your seal, but it seems to me it stems from how we attribute a positive emotion towards all those remembered, and even The ones I remember badly, inside face we appreciate, like Hitler my grandfather passed away, it&#39;s weird, I knew and saw that he would not last long but I also noticed that every time we were the whole family with him and he got a lot of love he suddenly felt better, right that too Related to drugs but is like I came to get him out of the bathroom, so after a night we were all with him and held him, that&#39;s how he felt better, that&#39;s how much love you get that&#39;s how you get stronger, I&#39;m from dad I did not get a lot of love, that&#39;s how I feel at least, It seems to me that a lot of negative people it&#39;s simply because they did not get much love, I do not really know how it goes but it&#39;s interesting, do what you most enjoy doing, so apart from fucking I also like to think, but I&#39;m just important to find what I want Or most like to do, when in fact this is what I do most of the time trying to answer, trying to look for answers, or connections also connections it from And an important mistake, it connects me to relationships, relationships between concepts, it&#39;s the contexts I&#39;m talking about, it connects me to language, how its structure starts from the verb and the noun and the relation and the name, or the concept, for example tree, the relation of the tree itself seems to come much later, I want to think how to study effectively, but why because I&#39;m at the Technion yes so what, why do I need something from the Technion why do I need the Technion, I just flow after what my friends did, enjoy you like to think, it&#39;s just that, it&#39;s to think, and a lot , So do it you have questions, you have problems, try to think about them, but then I do exactly what culture expects of me, you want to influence culture, that&#39;s what you do, through your thinking, what question do you want to answer? It does not matter, the Technion gives you tools, such as language, without language, how you would think, try to think without language, as in gibberish meditation, try to control your thought, can you really do it, what you think about when you think Except for food and sex, but masturbating is not the same as with a girl, oh I would like someone who&#39;s just flowing, someone to just fuck her whenever I want, because that&#39;s what&#39;s called fun, but they think about marriage, not like that, I&#39;m sure Not all of them, but they do not get tired after doing it once with a certain man, but why not, years of evolution have done their thing, all their eggs are bigger, but what a huge difference has happened, ha, and now there is evolutionary stability, it Nice this topic, they take theory, and what catches, stays, not like that, most of the time it will be a mistake but in the meantime it allows development, so take a basic hypothesis and test it, and if it is not correct, then proceed from it, but do not have this possibility or privilege to speculate Something and find out in the evening that it is not true, but what is true, there is no right is wrong, there is more or less true for example it is hard for me to imagine that someone could have predicted Einstein&#39;s theory before Newton, nothing And besides the concepts you define, although at the moment language is quite defined for me, then what concepts can I build die theories like for example mathematics, how do I know what I like? Question, then assume you like something, and if you do not you will already feel it,
