I consider how long after retirement, if there is no avalanche, you can withdraw 8%
Because if you&#39;re just retiring in the glider, then you know it&#39;s probably always going to be okay
The maximum is ten years because it is a complete cycle
If I retire at 40 and after ten years, well not ten, 9
Still mid-work?
Probably because of the linearity, which after 5 years is a spin
And by 45 I believe I will be able to come back
Especially if I work on some side project that can be perceived as work


Maybe positive towards myself is my frequency
The frequency of exchanging the positive towards the self with the negative towards the self
