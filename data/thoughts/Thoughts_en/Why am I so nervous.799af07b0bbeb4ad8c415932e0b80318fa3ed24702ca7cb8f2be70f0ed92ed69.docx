Why am I so nervous?
It annoys me that Sheeran now feels she is the victim.
She arrives in Paris a place that everyone dreams of being and she suffers every moment.

But she claims she feels imprisoned because she does not speak the language, and has no money to enjoy here, and no support for me.

But I have no money for her to enjoy here, and she has no money to enjoy the country either.

But here she has no language.

So stay in the country

But there I will not be

So what can be done?
