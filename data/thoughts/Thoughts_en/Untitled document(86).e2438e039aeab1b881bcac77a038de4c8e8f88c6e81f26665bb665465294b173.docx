What are the options?

Well then I went over the opportunities on crowdstreet
I could only analyze two there that were about multifamily
They were nothing
I can try to analyze other assets
I can analyze opportunities on other platforms
I also analyzed Neil&#39;s proposal
She&#39;s not something either
The rent they are asking for is really high
In total, I analyzed 9 opportunities
A good number is 20 suppose
Tomorrow I&#39;ll go with Nola&#39;s parents
Thursday we drive to the center
Then spend time in the center. Do not know how long we will have
Dude what?
I can next week analyze another 10-11 opportunities
And I&#39;m done
Then choose
And hope they accept me
Put 50k and I&#39;m done
And hope it goes well
