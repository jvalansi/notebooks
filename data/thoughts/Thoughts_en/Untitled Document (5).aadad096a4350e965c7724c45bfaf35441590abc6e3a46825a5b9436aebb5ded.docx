At 25 I am at my peak
At 75 I am nothing
Probably a linear decrease
Every five to twelve percent
10* 10 =100
So now I&#39;m about 80 percent
From the age of 40 onwards I am less than 70 percent
It&#39;s still a lot
But on average it is 35 percent
For how long?
40 years
What is the alternative?
Be content while I have half of the half, a quarter of the time
Or half the time in the future
One can mathematically calculate who is right
Leaves it as proof to the reader

I need to do a roast me with a fake account
Berdit

I considered both sides, what is the chance that what one side wants is simply its relative share
And the other side wants as much as possible

Tell Sheeran that if she wants to know what I did, tell her what she wants to know
But she must not just say otherwise I do not trust her at all anymore

The calculation
At 40 I am about 70%?
Then I have 40 years of seventy percent
Instead of retiring at sixty-five, with some on the side?
Or set aside

The calculation is as follows
Live on half to forty then forty forever live on half forty
But utilize instead of a quarter of life utilize at least half
It&#39;s twice as much
So I lose half and win twice as much
It&#39;s offset
So from the age of 40 I live fifty percent?
Otherwise all my life I live a quarter

I can now live a quarter of the time according to two of the half I live on now (which is 1)
And so forever
Or another five or four years to live on half the time, with half
Totally the same, only two now suffer and live five years on half of what I can
It&#39;s only worth it if I can do it now
Is there a situation I was wrong?
So by mathematical logic I&#39;m making a mistake?
sailing
Now is a more important time than that
But happiness is not determined linearly with income, until the average income it rises one by one, then after the average it does not rise much
It is difficult to quantify
So come on I did not come to a conclusion
There is a situation that cannot be concluded here

Good
what do you want?
Do not know
What about you?
So what angle?
Also need to set
Some say it does not cost more than a hundred thousand
So what does it matter
This is quite a scientific proof
But relies on sociological research
Do not know if you trust them
Good
What else?
