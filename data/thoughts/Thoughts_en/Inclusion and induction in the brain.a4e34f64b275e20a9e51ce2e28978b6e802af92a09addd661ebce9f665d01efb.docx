Inclusion and induction in the brain:
Generalization - When several neurons shoot together into the same neuron, the phenomenon is integrated into the same neuron, for example a neuron that symbolizes an auto-shot when it detects four wheels and a body, a neuron (or neurons) four wheels and a body neuron are integrated into one neuron
Induction - when we see only four wheels we will include in the car we will imagine that there is a body, even though the body&#39;s neuron did not fire at all
This is enough for the level of computation of a Turing machine (or Mada calculation)
Anyone with a brain can generalize and do induction (requires only 2 layers)
