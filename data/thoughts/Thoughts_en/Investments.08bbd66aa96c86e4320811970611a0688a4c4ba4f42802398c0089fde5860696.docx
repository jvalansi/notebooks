Why not invest 90% on the market, and 10% against it
Letâ€™s say the market goes up each year by x%, and once every 10 year it goes down 50%
While the average is 10%
(1+x)^9*0.5=1.1^10
(1+x/1.1)^9=2.2
x =2.2^(1/9)*1.1-1=~0.2
In this case the portfolio earns 0.9*1.2+0.1*0.8=1.16 in the good years, and 0.9*0.5+0.1*2=0.65 in the bad year, instead of 1.2 in the good and 0.5 in the bad
I can even make it more stable by investing more against the market. Say I want steady 8%, that means x*1.2+(1-x)*0.8=0.8+0.4*x=1.08 x=0.7
Then in the bad year I get 0.7*0.5+0.3*2=0.95, which is not super bad
Generally, if the average is 10% then 
x ^ 9 * y = 1.1 ^ 10
9*ln (1+x)+ln (1-y) = 10*ln (1.1)
9x-y = 0.95
