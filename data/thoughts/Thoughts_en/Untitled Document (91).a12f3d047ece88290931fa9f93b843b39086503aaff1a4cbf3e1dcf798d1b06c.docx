good so
what am I doing
What am I doing next week?
Work on market forecasting? About natural language?
Maybe you can combine?
A natural language in the capital market?
It requires reading comprehension
I need to know how to read stock reports
The goal is to avoid the next fall
And get ~ 10% on the money

10% is seven years 7% is ten years

So what do I want to do with natural language?
I want to talk to him
And that will answer me
