If time is only present in thermodynamics, which also relates to computation, maybe we can see the future because p!=np
Can we have a time invariant Turing machine? Can we have a time invariant neural net? Learning requires time to pass.
So can we relate entropy to computation? To np  problems?
Entropy is related to information, thereâ€™s a limitation on the amount of information required to reduce entropy.
This is related to the Landauer limit
