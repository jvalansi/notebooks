Good,
I have to read one document from the read every day
Every week follow the pending, letâ€™s say Monday night

We are just processing units
Machines with input and output
We can use plants and soil and create agriculture
Use guns and create casualties
Use words and create knowledge

So suppose it&#39;s a group of monkeys
They can move
They can use something to produce something
They can eat
They can act on things

You can set actions separately
All it takes is grammar
There is a subject who can perform an action on an object

Maybe we should start what wh
what
who will
how
Why
When
where
Some

Time and space
