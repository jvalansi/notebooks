It&#39;s a coincidence that Kelly from Google broke my heart that day Kelly (Lisa) broke my heart
Like what&#39;s the chance of that happening that day?
How many times in my life have my heart been broken like that
In the last ten years this has not happened
And what is the chance that a company will break my heart
The last time I tried to get accepted to a company like this it was to Google and that was about five years ago
So what is the chance that something with a frequency of once every five years and ten years will happen on the same day?
It&#39;s 1 for 365 * 10 * 5 * 365 or 1 for over 50 million
And what is the chance that they both have the same name?
Well it&#39;s not exactly the same name
But it&#39;s a variation of the same name
Suppose the similarity between the names is
kallie
Kelly
It&#39;s a resemblance of 3 letters out of 5 at least, and that&#39;s the important letters too, but suppose a resemblance of 60%
From how many names are there
What is the frequency of this name?
The most common name with such a resemblance is kayla
And that&#39;s 155,000 out of 20 million (for the 90s age group, which I guess they were both born in)
It&#39;s one in 130
Total 1 to 16 thousand
Making the probability of this event one to about 800 billion
Really low chance
Almost one in a trillion
Obviously this could be coincidental
But in reviving one in a trillion
That&#39;s pretty crazy
It does not seem to me that I have had a more rare coincidence than this
I told this to a psychologist
She was not impressed
She is very meter of fact
Good
What else?
Do not know
I was trying to figure out what the feelings were in Vipassana
Let&#39;s look again
They say it&#39;s just the noise barrier level goes down (noise gate) and then you feel feelings that are usually filtered as noise
that make sense
That&#39;s also what I think
Good
What else?
Do not know
It was nice today with the Israeli company
We were in a house of leeks
June contacted someone who lives with the leek what the shark plan is
What part of
And we jumped in to say hello
What a house
huge house
Heated pool
Really impressive
Good
The walk was nice too
This Ionic man is interesting
Nir, too
With his Nir Det Experience
What a section it is
Good
What more?
Do not know
I got a little tired
But that&#39;s a good thing
Excellent even
Beauty
What else?
Do not know
What about you?
Do not know
Everything is fine
Still upset
But what can be done
Probably with time it will fade
this is life
Semc
The truth is I was with longer hair when she liked me
Maybe I&#39;ll get back to that
Oops
What does it matter
Another guy like that will come and do this to her and this is another break
Although women are often locked up
So why not me?
Of what he did to her
I was dying to be a girl just to see how he was
Maybe the people had such a filter that makes you a daughter
There is such a filter
I can also put on a wig
But I&#39;m not going to shave for it
Good
so what are we doing?
Maybe I can pay some daughter to do it
I&#39;m obsessed
I need to let go
There are many fish in the sea
This is a section where the heart is locked
Maybe we are monogamous
But only up to the baby
Then the baby is what continues the monogamy
Maybe
Good
What else?
I&#39;m pissed off about Google
As if one pain feeds the other pain
Because every time I remember one and try to release from it the other comes up
In short without Google I am stuck in this job that I do not feel I am contributing enough
I hope I do well in the interesting project
I hope maybe they will let work on it full time
we will see what will be
From what I understood after Sky it should already be more a matter of features and less of a platform
So hope it gets better
And if I do not ask to pass
Everything is fine
Maybe I&#39;ll really try to get into finance
seen
Good
What else?
Walla
Do not know
We will go to sleepâ€¦
