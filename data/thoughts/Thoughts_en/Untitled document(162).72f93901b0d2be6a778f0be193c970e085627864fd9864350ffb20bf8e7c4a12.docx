What&#39;s going on?
everything is good how are you?
Sabba, so what do you say?
Not too much, I&#39;m working on automatic transliteration. It&#39;s nice, but much harder than I expected.
I&#39;m just trying to think how hard it would be to do harder things of text production.
Like speech for example.
I wonder how the winner of the Turing competition works.
AIML
And there is also this:

With 6k stars in GitHub
But it&#39;s rule based rules

What about trading software



I can use it instead
Maybe it&#39;s worth trying Zipline

Come on
What more
The weekend is over
Feels like I did not do much
I was at a social event and then in the park from noon to evening
Yesterday we were at sea, we also came back quite late, and I went to bed early

I more think what to do artificial
Yesterday morning I did nothing
I may need to take time to think about what to do

What do I have to do?
There are emails
Tabs open
Bookmarks
Asana / Spreadsheet

By and large I am traveling from work reading an email, and a bookmark
And during the week I&#39;m supposed to do things from Asana, or the issue
I was happy to make an app from the issue
It should be pretty simple
The question is whether I want to invest in it

Also do not know in which project to invest
I then did an analysis of the possibilities and it seems to me that the most logical is in language processing
Because it&#39;s the most interesting
And there is profitable potential
But stocks are also quite interesting
Also real estate

Language processing but also helps me at work
And learning it will help me in other areas as well
I need to do long-term planning
Where I want to be a year from now even five years from now
How much effort I give to everything
Five years from now I wish I was free, with ten duplexes each making $ 500 a month
Is this the best case scenario?
Perhaps the best case scenario is to open up a language processing startup.
Or being in a startup as a chief computational researcher or engineer, and having the startup bring me a lot of money
It seems to me that I would have preferred the startup to be mine
Maybe both?
