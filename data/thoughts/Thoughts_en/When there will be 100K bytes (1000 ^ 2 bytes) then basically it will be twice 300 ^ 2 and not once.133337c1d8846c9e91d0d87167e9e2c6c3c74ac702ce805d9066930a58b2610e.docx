When there will be 100K bytes (1000 ^ 2 bytes) then basically it will be twice 300 ^ 2 and not once

A player can move in 4 directions and will probably finish in 64 steps
The board can move in 4 directions for 6 dice (24 ~ 32 directions) probably within 24 ~ 32 steps
So we have a total
4 ^ 64 = 2 ^ 2*64 = 2 ^ 128
32 ^ 24 = 2 ^ 5*24 = 2 ^ 120


if corner and a box is not on target
