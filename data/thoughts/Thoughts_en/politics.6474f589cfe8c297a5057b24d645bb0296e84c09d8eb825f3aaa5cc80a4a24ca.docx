The goal: to be the center of gravity of the group
You have an amount of credit and you need to determine to whom you are distributing it.

For example for three players:
If the other two give each other more king you lose
The goal is for both of them to give you more

You can also give to yourself
You need to be given the most
Everyone is trying to get into this situation
So for that actually invest more in the weak, which does not threaten you
On the other hand you do not want only the support of the weak
Because it also matters how strong your supporter is
You want to have the highest self-vector value
You want to be first in page rank
That&#39;s what everyone wants, too

For three players:
There is a 3 * 3 matrix
You set one line to maximize your page rank

How does the page rank work?
You take the self-vector that belongs to self-value 1, because it is the solution of a steady state.

For two:
Av = v
a11*v1+a12*v2=v1
(1-a11)v1+(1-a12)v2=v2

a11 * v1 + a12 (1-v1) = v1
a12 = (1 + a12-a11) v1
a12 / (1 + a12-a11) = v1

a12 = 0.5 * (1 + a12-a11)
a12 + a11 = 1
pole: 1+a12=a11 -> a11=1, a12=0

According to this, it is better for each player to simply invest only in himself
There is no guarantee that investing in someone else will help
It&#39;s like a gift:
You give in hope
