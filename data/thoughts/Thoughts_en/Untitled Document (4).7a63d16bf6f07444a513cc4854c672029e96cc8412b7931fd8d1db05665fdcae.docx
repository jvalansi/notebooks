Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
We arrived in Cancun
That&#39;s all right
We are in a room with two small beds and a view of the garden
You can move to a larger bed or a view of the sea but to both
Question will be my troubles
We&#39;ll go to the sea today
What else?
Not too much
Sitting at sea
In the sun that remained
I forgot that the sun is setting in the other direction
So it&#39;s almost over
But nice that in the room we have a sunset
This
Yaron once again won chess
Well it&#39;s good
Challenges me
Like Haifa it&#39;s like San Francisco
And Tel Aviv as to LA
Jerusalem is Vegas
Their name is God
