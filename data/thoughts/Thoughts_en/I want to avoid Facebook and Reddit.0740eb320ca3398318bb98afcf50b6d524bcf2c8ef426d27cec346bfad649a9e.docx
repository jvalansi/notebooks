I want to avoid Facebook and Reddit
I go there because it&#39;s the least energy
My brain needs input so as not to get bored
Which input is better than Facebook and Reddit?
On Facebook I usually read about politics and economics
Sometimes there are funny things too
Berdit is news from around the world
Interesting Stuff
Funny things
I can look at what I did like
And try to find a way to get straight to the source

In essence this is the symptom and not the problem
I just have no more interesting input

How do you explain games
Where there is also an output and still people prefer the games
Maybe I should do a gamification for the things I really want to do
What makes something a game?
What games do I like?
Suppose Candy Crush is addictive
Why?
Civilization I really liked
Why?
There is a purpose
There are not very complicated and not too simple steps to reach the goal


I want a good place for all my lists
