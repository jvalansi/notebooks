I have full job offers
I should be happy
This is an opportunity to move forward
Although I do not see how I am progressing so much
I think my best chance of being a computational learning researcher is in Apple
And in the meantime I still have previous commitments
I want to finish the investment
I want to study for interviews
I want to work on the startup I do not have

I&#39;m not really working on the startup
The priority is to study -
The investment is expected to end this week
I also want to look at investing in startups
But not everything is possible
So what are you saying?

This week we will finish the investment
We will go over what is needed in workera
And what about the interviews?
Oops

I can put in
