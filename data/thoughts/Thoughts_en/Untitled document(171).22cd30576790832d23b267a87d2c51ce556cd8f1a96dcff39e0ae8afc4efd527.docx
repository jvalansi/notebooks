So what&#39;s the plan?

According to the data, I am supposed to do between 7 and 10 percent a year and retire for another 7 to 10 years

That&#39;s why it&#39;s worth concentrating on what interests me
I am largely interested in machine learning, specifically natural language
I was going to try to develop something in the field
There are some projects I can work on:
Predict the capital market, as I have already begun
Predict the real estate market, or value of a home
Use language processing
To predict the capital market
Predict the real estate market
Another area
Customer Service
secretary

It seems to me that in the first stage I will try my hand at Kegel
Because it&#39;s a big supportive environment
It is also good to find a job later
And there are also tasks of real estate and natural language

There is no hazelnut here it seems to me

Where would I like to see myself in another 5 years?
Where would I like to see myself in the end?
What is the dream?
Pass a Turing test
