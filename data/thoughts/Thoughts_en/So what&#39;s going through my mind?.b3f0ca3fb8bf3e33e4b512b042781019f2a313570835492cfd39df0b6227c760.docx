So what&#39;s going through my mind?
What always goes through, is that I want to be free, for that I need a million dollars, that&#39;s all
I believe I can get there in 14 years, if I put enough aside and invest the money
I would have been happy if it had happened before, with some startup or something

what else?
I would like to know how to develop applications (web, Android, iPhone)

what else?
I want to die
Peace of worlds no?

I do not know, I have nothing in mind
