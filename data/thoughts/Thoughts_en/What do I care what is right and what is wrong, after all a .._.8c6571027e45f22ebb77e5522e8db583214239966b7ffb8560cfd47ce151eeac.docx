What do I care what is right and what is wrong, I should care what is right for me, completely subjective, if I feel it then for me it exists
Maybe for communication, for me to be able to speak objectively so that everyone understands me, to communicate with others,

Did the culture start with &quot;concept&quot; or &quot;good versus bad&quot;
What&#39;s good or bad, it&#39;s completely subjective, but it&#39;s a way of culture to preserve itself, do not kill, it&#39;s not good for culture because it will contain fewer people and thus weaken
But good and bad were before that because since time immemorial the genes dictate to us what is good and what is bad, after all every living thing knows that fucking and eating is good and getting hurt and dying is bad, so once we started to conceive of everything we also had to name maybe these feelings
But why read by name? To improve communication, because better communication means a stronger tribe, means less danger to the garden
Good and evil are already concepts, so I guess concepts preceded good and evil, when did they start? When a person had time to ask the question, when he did not bother all day with survival perhaps?
So communication through concepts made us stronger, and the concepts themselves began to control us as genes began to control the material that creates them,

What do I care?
Because I care why I ask questions or what we have besides animalism what is culture, where does it lead
