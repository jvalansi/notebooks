Need to do some sort of private stack overflow that I ask questions and then answer inside
options:
Use some open source stack overflow
Write everything down in documents in Drive
Use asana for this
Use the tasks of the iPhone

Pros and Cons
Add more stack overflow it&#39;s a bit over cool I also need a server to store it
Registering in Drive is convenient and accessible from anywhere
Asana coordinates all the private tasks but she is not yet fully baked and I need the tasks as well
I try not to use tasks for private things

Well then drive

I also want to get rid of all the open tabs
And from all emails
And of all missions

Right now most of my private life is concentrated in this apartment in Florida

What are my goals for the year?
I want to buy 2 apartments that will bring me ~ $ 600 a month
If I do it every year within 7 years I&#39;m done
If $ 700 within 6
$ 800 within 5, that&#39;s if I manage to raise enough money to buy 2 every year
It is not so feasible, but in 4-5 years it will be feasible
So it&#39;s 2 year, maybe 2 next year, brother 1, 1, then again 1 or 2 and then 2
And we finished within 5-6

I have no more destinations?
I want to be free, so that&#39;s all I see
There is also the section of children
There is also the section of computerized learning
I want to do the last Andrew Ing course

I want to save at least 40k
Inhaling 48k, and taking out 48k
I&#39;m currently spending 60, and it seems to me that a lot of it is because of the apartment
Need to move to Berkeley

I want to centralize my lists
Asana is not baked enough it feels, I am missing the reminders, it also does not appear in the diary properly, and the logic of recurring reminders is not good
I would be happy if it was open source, best Python, and I could contribute


What&#39;s the big picture?
Do not know
I just want to be free
Now I give the 8-18 Monday through Friday to work
It&#39;s 50/168 = ~ one - third
I also give 8 hours out of 24 for sleep, that&#39;s another third
What do I have left?
a third?
My 62 hours?
And I&#39;m half working on them

My head is full
It seems to me because of real estate

All tabs open
I&#39;m trying to find out which virtual broker to use
There is the strength finder looking for strengths, which is one of the bestsellers
Look at yelp understand the division into business
A deal from the Mitap group
Links from business cards from the Mitap group

I can not add a bookmark because it is not a safari
In essence it should be upside down I need to add everything to Firefox

But when do I read it all…
I have too much Todo
Everything in Asana
The open tabs
The emails I did not finish
Real estate investments

So how do I close everything?

What do I do with the tabs?
The emails?
How I arrange the investments, it comes as a relative surprise
How do I organize the information?

I have to read from a reading list every day, not of work, of home
It&#39;s the tabs
The emails?
I can keep them, but when do I take care of them?
In essence it is a stamp as in work

Real estate investments just happen
