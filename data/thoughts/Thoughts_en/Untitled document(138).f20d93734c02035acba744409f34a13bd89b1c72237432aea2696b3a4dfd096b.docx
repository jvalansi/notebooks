The US GDP should be equal to the national income.
That’s the private income (salaries), corporate income (profits) and public income (taxes).
The difference is “Consumption of Fixed Capital” which is depreciation. It’s ~3T
Salaries is the largest part, almost 10T
Capital income is 1.4T
Rent income is 0.6T
Corporate profit is 2T
Net interest 0.6T
Taxes on production etc 1.2T

S&P 500 market cap is 23T and has p/e ratio of ~20, meaning 23/20~=1T in earnings (profits). Accounting for more than half the corporate profit (it’s possible that a lot of the profit is abroad, leaving the national income much lower than 1T)
