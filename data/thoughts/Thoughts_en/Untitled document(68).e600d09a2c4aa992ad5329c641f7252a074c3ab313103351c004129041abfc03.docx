So what do you think of God?
God is energy
It has always been always will be, it is in everything, and it decides the big future
Although knowing the starting points of energy, does it really point to the future?
If I know exactly where a ball is in the air, can I predict its next point?
No, because I do not know what the speed is, what the acceleration is, what is derived from any of its order in time
By and large the second derivative should suffice
What is special about the second derivative?
Do not know

Basically if you know what speed and what forces are at work you know everything
So only need one derivative
Do the working forces stem solely from energy?

By the way, this points to an uncertain future

Gravity is due to a mass that is actually equivalent to energy
Is an electromagnetic charge also equivalent to energy?

What do I think about religion?

The man heard voices in his head, that he did not know where they were coming from

Rock treats it as if God is reality
And should always be in the moment, in reality, together with God and not move away and think about the past or the future because the only thing that exists is the present
And maybe from here the name
How does this reconcile with my faith?
Do not know
Is this contradictory?
Reality is also energy
It&#39;s all energy

Is what matters to be in the moment?
After all, when you read the Bible, are you in the moment?
What is it to be in the moment?
To be in the flu
Be focused on only one thing
But not necessarily in the present
I mean, it&#39;s happening in the present
But you can concentrate on drawing a sample
And is in the present
And it fills your mind that there is nothing else that interferes
So
