Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
I had the interview on Friday
There was nothing
In the first interview I was really slow
Do not know why, probably because of pressure
I did a warm up with some two easy questions before, not knowing why it took me a while to wake up
I do not know if she passed me, guess 45%
In the second interview he was fine
But it&#39;s hard to know
There&#39;s a situation I completely missed
But suppose 55%
A third interview was reasonable until he asked a code question, not complicated but due to time pressure I did not come up with an optimal solution
Here too it does not seem to me that I passed, he asked questions of knowledge and I answered, but do not know if I answered correctly
Maybe 40%
Your brother had a planning interview that was fine I think, 55 maybe 60
I&#39;m doing a behavioral interview that also went well, it seems to me, really hard to know, maybe 55
Oops
But it&#39;s hard to know
we will see what will be
This
But over
I sat on this thing for two months
I learned a lot
It gave me a lot of motivation
That&#39;s good
This week I think I can rest
I have but all kinds of arrangements
I have to make the financial agreement
And we need to do couple therapy
And I have more things on the list
I also wanted to work on the investment strategy
The idea is to take what maximizes the historically low 5%
Because that&#39;s how they concluded that it was quite safe to attract 4% of S&amp;P
So maybe going for a strategy that maximizes it can increase the pace of attraction
The problem is that it usually does not indicate future results when there is not much history
So if I really want to find a good strategy I need a lot of data
Let&#39;s see if there is data
I can download with Yahoo
Good
I can take the list of stocks in the investment basket that includes the entire market
Extract for everyone all the information from Yahoo
And work on it
I also need to think about what sampling does to the distribution
Basically suppose I have 10 options, and I choose 2 of them
The smallest number
2 - 1 1
Ach 3 - 2 1 and 1 2
Ach 4 - 2 2 and 1 3 and 3 1
5 - 2 3 , 3 2, 1 4, 4 1
6 - 3 3, 2 4, 4 2, 5 1, 1 5
This is a pretty linear truth
In the middle will be 10
Here you can come with any combination of a pair of numbers
There are 20 combinations
Is it linear with any amount of numbers?
What would happen with 3 numbers
3 - 1 1 1
4 - 2 1 1, 1 2 1, 1 1 2
5 - 1 1 3, 1 2 2
6 - 1 1 4, 1 2 3, 2 2 2
7 - 1 1 5, 1 2 4, 1 3 3, 2 2 3
This too is pretty linear
In the middle there
15 - 1 4 10, 1 5 9, 1 6 8, 1 7 7, 2 3 10, 2 4 9, 2 5 8, 2 6 7, 3 3 9, 3 4 8, 3 5 7, 3 6 6, 4 4 7, 4 5 6, 5 5 5
But the combinations grow, if there is importance to order
And it increases according to the amount of options, although for 3 different numbers it is always the same amount of options to arrange
So that&#39;s not the point
It&#39;s pretty linear
If it&#39;s linear, then the 5% is in the 10% range it seems to me
Why because if I have a triangle, then 5% of the triangle is where?
If it was a right-angled triangle, then 5% is 10% that should be squared for space
Even if it&#39;s not a right-angled triangle I guess
Not really
If it is not a right angle then there is no resemblance
5% is 10% of the right half angle of the isosceles triangle
So that means
Wait then for a right angle of 10 length, if I take a piece of one length, let&#39;s say the height is h then the height of the piece is h / 10 then the area is h / 20 relative to the full area which is 10h / 2
So the ratio between the areas is 100, then a tenth becomes a hundred, the square because of the area
So 5% is 1/20 or 1/10 of the half, so to get to this ratio in the field, need together of a root of it in length, I mean ⅓ about
But is that a third of the half?
Suppose the length is 40, then the length of the half is 20, then the area is 10h then the third is 13 and the area is 6h
So no, you need a third of the half, I mean a sixth, it&#39;s 7 and then the area is 1h = 3.5 * 0.35h which is a tenth of the half and five percent of everything
So need the amount instead of sixth
interesting
I wonder if it really works
Anyway I&#39;m not sure this is the right way
I think the 4% comes from the fact that it&#39;s half the average percentage for the times when the market falls by half
Although order should not be important
If it fell in half sometime, it does not matter when
Or maybe it matters, because the rate of attraction is constant
So you want to earn long before this fall…
Do not know
Basically when I did the calculation for the S&amp;P now, I did not take into account the attraction, and reached around 4%
By and large it is always possible to withdraw 8% of the portfolio, the only question is where it went down
So what&#39;s the point of taking the low 5% or the 95% not to crash
If every decade there is one year of collapse, then there is a 10% chance of collapse, but a 90% increase
Suppose a 10% decrease of 50% and a 90% increase of 10%
Like currency,
So how best to invest in such a situation?
Do not know
And what is the distribution of a sample in such a case?
Why not take the product that gives the best Sharp ratio, and leverage it
Take a loan and put on it…
Why not?
The more general problem is that the past does not necessarily indicate the future
Approximately yes, until he does not
This is another experiment
Just take the best Sharp ratio that year and leverage
I wonder what size loan I can take
How much do I need?
By and large I suppose can take a loan of 100 thousand, put in this stock,
Or I can just buy an option of the stock
But I do not have the information about it
On a private loan take 6%
That sounds like a lot,
The market is doing some 8% and I do not know if it is index linked
