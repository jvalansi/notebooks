So Ashley will not keep in touch with me
I can understand her
It probably will not develop into a relationship
Although I do not know if not
But the chances are slim
We do not speak the same language
She probably will not pass
I probably will not pass
Good
Next week last time I will see her
we will see what will be
I&#39;m really upset
I guess that&#39;s a good thing
Healthy to feel
For a long time I did not feel
But Bassa is in pain
Good
What more?
Do not know
I finished?
My dad beats alcohol at home
Freaking out
what can we do
I think at his age I would just smoke all day
My mom is just addicted to doing things
That it&#39;s a spin
If it&#39;s good for her
That everyone will do what makes him good
This is true?
That everyone will do what is good for him, is that good?
There is such a section that sometimes to get high you need to go down a bit
The question is whether he wants to get higher
It seems to me he did his thing
He seems a little angry at me or something, does not know what the point, does not know if I care
like I care
But I also care about myself, I see no reason to flatter
Good
But anyone who does what is good for him is basically the missing hand
It&#39;s basically God
So from selfishness we get progress
It&#39;s not intuitive
So most people do not believe it
But is this also true outside the economic world?
I think yes, there is nothing special in the economic world, it is just a measurable part of the general world
Good
Something else?
This guy with the skateboard has brought so much peace to the world
He just did what was good for him
Suppose what&#39;s good for me is to leave her
It will hurt her
The total amount of happiness, do not know if it will rise
Because we avoid risks
