Multiplying by 3 is not a problem
Simply multiply the number by 2 and add the number
for example:
10110101101
3*
=
101101011010
10110101101+
=
1000100000111

Divide by two is the opposite action, you need to find a number that if you subtract it and divide the result by two you will get the same number
for example
1000100000111
-abcdefghijkl
=
Abcdefghijkl0
