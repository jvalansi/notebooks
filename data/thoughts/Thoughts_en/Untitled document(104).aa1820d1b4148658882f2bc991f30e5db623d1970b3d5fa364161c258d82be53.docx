If I were allowed to choose between joy or wisdom, I feel I would choose wisdom
On the face of it this contradicts nihilism, or the maximization of happiness
So why would I do that?
It&#39;s like this need to touch a wound in the mouth
why is it?
Is this a mistake?
Is it software in me by the environment / genetics?
