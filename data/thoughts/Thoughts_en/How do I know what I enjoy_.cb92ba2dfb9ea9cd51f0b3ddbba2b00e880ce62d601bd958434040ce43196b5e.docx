How do I know what I am enjoying?
You just feel it
You love it you want to do it all the time
What do I want to do all the time besides masturbate, or sleep?
I want to know how to survive in the wild
I want to know how to achieve financial independence
I want to know how to study, I also want to learn, I also want to excel
I want to know how to get girls

In all these things there is the desire to know
What is knowledge?
A collection of concepts and relationships between them

Know - it seems to me it comes from the root opinion, the way to see the world

Maybe all a needy person wants is to fuck as much as possible and sleep the rest of the time,
Are not all monks really happy
After menopause, do women just want to sleep?

Or is culture just a means of genes for us to survive?

Not everyone likes philosophy, not everyone cares

There can always be things that distract me except when something is really in front of my eyes, passion

Like stopping this stupid war confrontation, bringing into the world a means that is not oil to propel it, so that the Arabs will need another way to get money, to experience the difficulty in life only under God
Why did Galileo care if we walked around the sun or vice versa?
