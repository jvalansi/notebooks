Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
What about you?
OK
I&#39;m really depressed that Ashley gave up on me
I really wanted her
Will be fine
But could have been amazing
Good
What else?
Do not know
What else?
At work fine
I talked to the principal about projects
I hope the matizationization project will be interesting
But it&#39;s hard to know
Also hope that normalization will be interesting
Good
What else?
Do not know
I&#39;m mostly in Bassa because of Ashley
Yesterday was poker, maybe I should have gone
okay, well
What else?
Joe Rogen was interesting with Alex Jones
Jones says there is no global warming, which I do not hear is true
But there were interesting things he said, like about this company Grove Something, that all the presidents meet there
But do not know how much it really affects the world
What else did he say?
Do not remember, probably not that critical
Do not see anything important in the searches
okay, well
An interesting man
He&#39;s sure tech&#39;s coming to destroy the world… I think he&#39;s wrong
What more?
Trump is apparently losing
I think this is not something for Israel
The reference is perhaps to sovereignty in Judea and Samaria
Although the plan exists
But the chances of it happening in a democratic administration are low
Bummer
Why?
Because Jews deserve to live in Judea
We arrived in the Promised Land but only near
We are like Moses
Good
What else?
The project did not progress today
What more?
Lawyer, I need to go back to the guy who wanted 2500
What more?
Do not know
What more…
There is not too much
Yesterday was poker
I tapped
I did not want to come up with allergies
But that&#39;s nonsense
My brain is not flexible
I went back to the anal type (T) I was
It&#39;s a basa
what can we do?
Do not know
Smoke more weed?

Were the Nazis bad people?
I do not think so
No more than any man who fights
We glorify the Jews who eliminated those living in Israel in the occupation of the land
Or the Americans who fought for their independence or the Israelis
Or the war on terror
But even here full of people are killed
The question is whether it is different to kill a civilian community than to kill soldiers
You could say killing is always bad
But it&#39;s not practical
You reduce the chance of winning if you set boundaries for yourself
In war there are no rules, in victorious tricks
So suppose it is better not to kill if not necessary
But what if need be
Is a soldier&#39;s life worth less than a civilian&#39;s life
There is a situation
But some less
Would you kill 10 soldiers to save a civilian?
Especially with us, soldiers did not choose it
But suppose I chose it
Am I worth a tenth of a citizen?
Do not think
The Nazis fought the Jews with the thought that they posed an existential threat
That does not mean they are bad people
If I had been born in Germany as a non-Jewish German, chances are I would also have become a Nazi
Good
What else?
Do not know
I have no power over anything
I need to send this girl money and invoices for cleaning and moisturizing diffuser
Good
I have no power
I do not know why I have no power for anything
Is it really work from home?
Why is it so awful?
Do not know
so what are we doing?
Do not know
Maybe I need a psychologist
Maybe a little more to move
Maybe bullets
Maybe Wade
As if it&#39;s just existential anxiety
I want to get away from this nothing
Why is it so awful?
Why is it impossible to live in this nothing?
Do not know
