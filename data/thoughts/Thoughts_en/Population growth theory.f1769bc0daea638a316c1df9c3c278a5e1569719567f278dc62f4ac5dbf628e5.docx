Theory:

When there is a controlling empire, its growth rate (population) stabilizes and decreases, which causes weakening in the long run.
When there is room with wars still (not under imperial rule) the growth rate increases (like the baby boom). This is what creates a historic loop.
It can perhaps be seen in Greece and Rome, Rome ruled for about 1000 years, during which time its growth rate could decrease, and then a situation could arise where the Vikings, and the Huns multiplied and became stronger in the meantime,
Perhaps this is what is happening today, when in the Western world the growth rate is moderating and among Muslims there is still a high rate.
It is possible that today the amount of the population is already less significant, thanks to the power of technology. The more technological wins, not the most in quantity. Although technological progress depends indirectly on the number of people.

When there are more children there is less energy directed at each of them, this creates a situation of a less quality population.
