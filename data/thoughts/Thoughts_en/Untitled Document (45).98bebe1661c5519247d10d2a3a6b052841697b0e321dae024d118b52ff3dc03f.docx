I was trying to understand why the media is leftist
It seems to me that there may be more consumerism of leftist values
More leftists are consuming media
It may also be because media owners are resilient people with leftist views
On the other hand I would expect them to be more right-wing as business owners
I noticed that two of the larger media owners cbs and nbc are Jews
Jews may be more inclined to the left
Maybe because of the Holocaust
Or because they are a minority
