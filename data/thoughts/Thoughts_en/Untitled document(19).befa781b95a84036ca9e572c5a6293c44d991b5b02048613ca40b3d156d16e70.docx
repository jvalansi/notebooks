Idea for a movie
(Remember my brother I wanted to check out how I once talked to girls)
Humans are reaching a new planet
Something&#39;s going on in the adults&#39; cell, everyone&#39;s dead
The children are left to fill the world
This world is the earth

Good

It could also be that the adults stayed and the technology was not simple
Maybe it was a strategy from the beginning
