If you had a billion dollars what would you do
Go after turing
Is it important?
Why do I need that
I want a computer that can do any job
I want a computer that can do research
I want a computer that can teach
I want a computer that can find a way for me to upload my brain to a computer
I want a computer to free me from the cables of biology
I want to be able to hire a computer to do lab work, to find a solution to death
I don’t mind a computer that is more intelligent than a person, that’s not a bug, that’s a feature.
If you can record all the signal of my brain, 
If you can simulate all the signals of my brain,
You should be able to produce something similar to my consciousness
100 billion (10^11 / 100G) neurons, 100 trillion (10^14 / 100T) connections,
To simulate a brain, you need a 100T RAM. 
This is possible with current supercomputers
But does that matter?
Can I connect my brain to a computer today?
Will I be able to do that?
Probably yes.
I connect my brain to a computer.
I have extra neurons for calculations.
