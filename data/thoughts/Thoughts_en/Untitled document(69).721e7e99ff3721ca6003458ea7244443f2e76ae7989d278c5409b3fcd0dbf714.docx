What&#39;s going on in my life?
Sabba
Still engaged in active learning
Peter is dying to get rid of me it seems
Tomorrow I will finish the important part

It&#39;s a bit of a bastard because you can do amazing projects with this thing
But what to do

As long as I can retire for another five years, I&#39;m not complaining
I do not think I will be fired
Objectively this year I made a great contribution

Well what else?
Walla not too much
Because I do not have too much hazel for the evening, I do not do too much
I was thinking of getting into Unity
It looks nice overall
Pretty simple, I knowâ€¦

I also want to make songs

Too many things
I looked at the verbs that appear in the timeline of history
The majority is around battles and victories
But I think most of it is about money and resources
I can try to predict next year&#39;s output
Maybe try to go back in time and see if the pace is really quite constant
We produce 3% more about every year
And give birth to 1.5%
This means that technology brings in 1.5%
We give birth to two things at a fairly even rate
Children and ideas

Well, so what
Do not know
