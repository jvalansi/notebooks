Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Bummer
Just sitting at home doing nothing
Another Day
I have no power
so what are we doing?
is nothing
Oops


It really seems like I had the most success in August
They all flew at me
And today only one to… flew over me
Do not know what happened
I also do not have pictures from August to know what was
In short, when I had full hair, I was not particularly attractive
But when I downloaded it I got a lot of positive feedback
Basically the first was a keyboard that was worth the most that flew over me
And Lisa&#39;s brother flew over me too
By and large until recently, it was kind of half and half those who flew and those who did not
But now it already feels like it is leaning in the non-direction
I was with about January 7th and only one seemed interested
Which is the opposite of August
Do not know what happened in this half year
Even less than four months
Good
what else?
Do not know
What do I have to do this week?
I could not find a therapist
I did not start the financial agreement
I need Sheeran&#39;s IDs
I&#39;ll do it
What more?
full
There are things to learn
Course in communication, course in psychology
Language, statistics
Need to take care of my license
And there are things of money
Investments, taxes, pension real estate, contributions
Where do you start?
Besides, I wanted to analyze everything I write
And a dentist
What to do?
What is most important
Couples therapy and financial agreement
Dude?
Basically taxes, do not know how much it will help
So what
Maybe invest?
Taxes can help me with a third of my income
That&#39;s a lot
But only up to about 50 thousand
That&#39;s a lot
So that would help in about $ 15,000
Which is less than 10% of income
If in investments I make another 10% it is worth more
Yes
What more?
Real estate, take care of insurance
To do refinance, I tried and did not work
Maybe I should just sell this property
Maybe go to cpa

lots of things
How to prioritize?
Learn something…
This is less important than other arrangements
But perhaps it is possible at the same time
Maybe
how?
You can do a few lessons a week
3 lessons suppose
When?
Instead of code questions maybe
Maybe
Good
Maybe I need an annual plan
Yes
Maybe look at what the plan was last year, and if I met the goals
Yes

what&#39;s going on?
Everything is fine
A little pissed that tomorrow I have to work on this uninteresting project
I&#39;ll try to finish it, but I do not think I will do the second part of it
Good
I think two projects and two courses is a spin
I think I can also double that
But it&#39;s a turn to leave a free space
Good
What more?

I would be happy if I had a better platform for tasks
I tried asana
But there is nothing to do it is not as convenient as reminders
do not know why
Maybe it&#39;s a matter of habit
But also sharing
Although I have no problem leaving what is common in reminders
Good
then what
Is it a gamification?
Do not know
What do you need for gameification?
Small goals and positive reinforcements
Do not know if there is it in the asana and calendar
I should do one maybe
Although its name is already a positive reinforcement
I received a whole email or notification from the app
Good
What else?
Do not know
Why is it so hard to find a task management app?
Just sucks that there are several different places for the same thing
Reminders, asana, email
