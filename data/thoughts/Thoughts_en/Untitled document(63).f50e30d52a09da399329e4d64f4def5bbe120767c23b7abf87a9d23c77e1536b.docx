Wow
Ashley
She&#39;s so beautiful
And speaks to the matter
I really do not know what to do
She saw my ring
She pretty much realized I&#39;m married
And we talked about it
And she hired said she could not marry me until I got divorced
So there is a situation that is really in my interest
But what do I do?
Sheeran is cute and everything
But she&#39;s amazing
Good early to know
We&#39;ll keep talking
There is a pretty big language barrier anyway
I think it can be overcome
I also do not really know if it&#39;s flirting (I believe not)
If I could meet her maybe I could know
Well I guess I have nothing to think about it now

The question is when?
When I have children?
But what do I do?
Do not know
Will we flow?

What&#39;s wrong with Lizrom?
This is the difference between intelligent design and evolution
I can make plans, but in the end evolution just wins
As in religion, as in economics
But flowing means I trust my emotion
And my feeling is not always right
Which is better, to decide with emotion or with logic?
Life is not math
What about work? I go with the logic in investing and working
Retiring early does not flow, it requires planning
I do not know
So flow here too?
