Why not buy an apartment here for 50k
Instead of renting 3k?
I pay a mortgage, 4%, from 200k, it comes out something like 1k a month
I save 2k like this, or 24k a year which is a 50% return,
How can it be?
Basically 50k at 12% return, supposed to bring in 500 a month, lowering my costs from 3000 to 2500
A 250k apartment rented for 3k is a great investment. It&#39;s over 1%
Up to 300k it makes sense to invest here

Okay, if it&#39;s 500k, I put 100k, pay 4%, it&#39;s 2k a month, saves 1k a month, 12k a year, great investment.
So even at 500 it&#39;s worth it to look
