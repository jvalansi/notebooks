Freedom of choice
Is this an illusion, which stems from the fact that we choose between similar alternatives?
Does living have freedom of choice?
The illusion of freedom of choice versus the illusion of causality
If there is no causality, there is randomness. But there is randomness at the quantum level
What exactly is freedom of choice?
The ability of an entity to choose between alternatives
Can an animal also choose? Can.
Like the donkey that is right between two piles of gravel. He will have to choose even though there is no priority

How can there be randomness as well as causality?
The solution in quantum as far as I know is when measuring the state collapses into one state
Or we are able to measure only one state, and the other states exist in parallel
Does this contradict causality
Probably not because science still stands, and aligns with quantum theory
Why do we have a choice?
Is everything predetermined?
Is it possible to see the rest of the dimensions?
As a man is born with one eye. He does not see three dimensions. But it is capable of taking on more dimensions
Maybe a quantum computer could take up more dimensions
Maybe even jump between them
So there is no freedom of choice?
