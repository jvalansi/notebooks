Sheeran says I need to see the apartment for myself
I can fly to see some contempt apartments
what else
What do I need to buy an apartment?
I will read the book
But by and large - see apartments, make an offer, if accepted do a check, find financing, sign
Your brother has to deal with the day-to-day maintenance, find tenants, repairs, ...

So what&#39;s the hazelnut?
Look for apartments
Make suggestions

Maybe I need more agents to have something to compare

Read the book

What more?
There are the startups and the second law, and I&#39;m also not sure I&#39;m happy with how I write assignments
