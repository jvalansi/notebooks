what is going on here?
All yesterday I was looking for escort agencies

I do not know what the point

The problem with asana is that I do not know what to work on
There are a million things, but there is nothing that means turning tasks into a calendar
By and large it should be of the least important importance
Then from the urgent to the least urgent
Even though I&#39;ll not get enough urgent stuff like that


I checked how computers do it

In Windows and Mac it&#39;s pretty simple:
There are queues with varying degrees of importance
A queue with greater importance gets priority
Those who are in one line for a long time move to the queue with greater importance

In Linux:
Always take the one who has the least time left
If someone does not finish in the allotted time, the time they have left increases

It still does not really meet the urgency
I guess in the end you have to decide on what has a higher priority, and add priority to urgent things

There are systems where there are two types of priority, where one type takes precedence over the other, and can replace something with a second type of priority

Such a thing can cause only urgent things to be done
That is why the amount of urgent things should be kept to a minimum

What urgent things should I do?

Nothing is urgent for me at the moment
