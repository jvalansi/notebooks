He constantly perceives that his glasses are crooked,
Then checks on a flat surface and sees that they are not curved
And he does not realize that it is not the glasses that are crooked, it is

&quot;No No&quot; is not &quot;Yes&quot;
For example if you want something to be wrong and do not find proof, it does not mean that it is

Why the hell do I need input

The matrix is going to happen with one differenceâ€¦ We are not batteries
We expend and put in energy in the same amount
Basically this is not the definition of batteries, batteries put in and expend the same amount of energy, but put that amount into them when you charge them, what is good about them is that they break down slowly and then do not need a direct connection to electricity
Electricity is produced differently, it is usually due to the burning of fuel, fuel is an organic substance that contains energy, the truth is that we too, but it is much more concentrated because it was in the center of the earth, probably more concentrated than it costs to expend.
So if you also consume this fuel in batteries, why not put a charcoal in your cell phone?
Charcoal needs to burn, the battery has a controlled chemical reaction that does it, the truth is that in our body the movement is also controlled,
Why not activate a cell phone from the energy of our body, because it is low, wow soon there will not be enough energy in the world to calculate! The calculation is exponential size, and the energy is not, I believe it will solve, but it should happen soon, maybe switch to solar energy, wow it&#39;s like an explosion, like lighting the earth on fire
It is ingenious to use the production of living semi-organisms perhaps in biological cells, for direct conversion from coal (or other organic matter) to electricity


Ask fast: fast without thinking 60 * 60 equals 360? Faster! Yes? Yes? Yes? Ahhh you missed

I defeated Sheeran in an argument:
I said Monica and Ross are the center of friends and she said Rachel because of the money, and then I said that everyone is friends only because of them they are the middle of friendships, and she agreed with me
