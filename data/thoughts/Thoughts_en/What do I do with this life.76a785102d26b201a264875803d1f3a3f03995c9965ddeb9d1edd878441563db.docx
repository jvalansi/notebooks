The whole day is wasted
See videos on YouTube
The truth is that the majority are interesting
But how would I rather spend the day
If I had the strength to do what I wanted
What would I do
I would probably be sitting on the project
I have to make it work
Or proceed to the next project
I need financial independence
I do not want to have to go to work
I need a million dollars
2 million so that Sheeran won&#39;t have to work either

I need to concentrate my investments
I have money in Mellanox - maybe 50,000
I have another 50,000 in the account at Leumi
And another 100,000 in the account at hsbc
I also have money in etrade
