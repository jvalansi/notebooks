What is inflation?
The bank prints more money
Is this money going to more loans?
People have more money available
Demand increases (demand curve increases)
Prices are going up

If you want more people you will have to increase the demand or increase the supply
If you want the price to go down, you have to increase the supply

I&#39;m still not closed on how the money goes from the bank that prints it to the public.
This could be if the printing bank transfers to the government, which decides to subsidize some service for example
