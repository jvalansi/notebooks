What now?
Good question
Let&#39;s start with &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;
Walla everything turned around
Day off…
Pretty
And how do you take advantage of it?
I went here to Aroma in the Grand…
Drink coffee and pastries
Sitting impressions impressions
here
Impressions
Maybe a blog is better…
Maybe…
Maybe a Jupiter notebook is better…
Maybe better
The best truth would be if I always had some open notebook
The truth is best if I had some open server
That I can run a notebook from
That way if I want to do some service, I can get away

Good
I made a notebook
Let&#39;s see what happens with this
What now?
See if I can run a notebook from it
then what?
We will see if it is possible to access from the cellphone
then what?
We will register there
And what about Hebrew?
We will register in English

Shortening is not the simplest

Why do I need it at all?
Because if I want to start writing a web app, I&#39;d rather do it straight in the cloud
As if this is not something that happens every day
But why not actually?

The problem is that you need a certificate
It&#39;s solvable
I just do not have the strength
Because I do not know how much it will already contribute
And I do not understand why it does not work at the moment
Good
Next
What else but my brother?
How will you feel from Basot when the holiday is over?
What do you want to get from her?
Oh I remembered another hobby
Startups
Okay
Investing in startups can also bring in 20% so I sign
Well come on it seems to me we will continue to the bathroom
Good
But then I can not go back
Maybe actually I can
Good
