Hey
What&#39;s up bro?
Do not know
I&#39;m addicted to sex live
It drives me crazy
The interaction with the most beautiful girls I have seen
And they all fly
Well maybe not flying
But turn around with me
Some more Some less
so what are we doing?
Walla I have nothing else
The project I put aside until I take some vacation
My brain is too busy right now
Also the divorce and everything
Name the party in the meantime

what else?
There is not too much
Every second I have a checker on the site
But I can not really do by hand
Because I have to keep the semen for Sheeran
That&#39;s good I guess
But I still look at the site all the time
This is what I most want to do
Tachles I would just travel to Colombia or Russia and make names there

okay, well
What else?
There is not too much
I get to talk a lot with my parents
I try to reduce the free hatred they have for religion
Religion for them is opium for the masses
The truth is that religion makes people happier
And I think it&#39;s better than addictive opium
I wonder if religion is addictive
I know it&#39;s hard to get out of this
But also not easy to get into maybe?
Do not know

I still do not understand the connection between fascism and the economic right
In the beginning the right was the supporters of the monarchy, you could say that fascism and monarchy go together
And on the left was the bourgeoisie and the poor
Once the monarchy disappeared, the bourgeoisie constituted the right and the poor the left
The bourgeoisie are the capitalists who own the business
The left supported more communism and socialism
So basically the question is who is the ruler, in communism the ruler is the communist party, in fascism the ruler is the dictator / king, in capitalism the ruler is the money
What is the connection between religion and fascism?
The rule of God, God is the King?
Do not know
Communism does not contain religion, but denies it
