So how do I represent a book using a graph
I create a graph from each sentence
Graph is a relationship between words
There are graphs that are repeated a lot in the language
Relationships are the special words
Then you can put a relationship between all the words and that&#39;s basically all the makeup in the world
Just need to add who said what
Although it is not known if this is important, as long as it is true
Maybe do it on all the articles in the world
Everything there should be right, right?
And if something does not work out, it could be a problem that needs to be solved

Interesting to see the distribution
