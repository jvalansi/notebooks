So what do I do
I have a lot of projects
Invest in housing
Deepmoney
Qordr
The experiment in physics
I need to relax
I also need to correct Sheeran the blessing that will come out better
Besides I also workâ€¦
There is also the section of egg freezing that will take time
And in general bringing a child is a sea of work
I&#39;m a little drowning in all this
I also want to make music
I want too many things

Deepmoney has a 1 in 10 chance of turning me into a multi-millionaire to a billionaire (like Buffett)
Qordr has a 1 in 10 chance of turning me into a multi-millionaire (like Tomer)
Housing has a pretty high chance of making me a millionaire
The experiment in physics could bring me a Nobel Prize
Also need to weigh what I enjoy

Qordr is less interesting to me
Also need to weigh what I need
In order to be free I need about a million dollars

Well then what do I have to do
housing:
Buy his book and read - a week
Talk to agents here in the area - two hours
Talk to agents in Florida - two hours
Talk to banks about financing - two hours
Analyze 100 opportunities - 80 hours
Deepmani
What they sent by mail - 8 hours
Do the rnn course when it comes out - a week
Assemble a system from 0 - week
Quarter
Talk to a friend of Ben Zrihan&#39;s - an hour
Try to publish the system with the clearing - 12 hours
Try to use Faber&#39;s advertising - 4 hours
physics
Calculate the probabilities of the particles passing through each side - 4 hours
Use a more reliable simulator - 12 hours
Figs
Peymank
Unity
What of all this do I want to do?

I will do the minimum necessary to advance in the secondary projects (Deepmani, Quarter and Physics)
The rest of the time will be devoted to the main project currently being real estate investment
