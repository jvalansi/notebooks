I&#39;m just adding stuff to the bookmark list…
I need to concentrate
in what?
In language processing
In computational learning
I would be happy if I could do it from my cell phone
But this is not critical
What is critical?
Do not know…
Do I even want to engage in learning?
Why?
I want to reach 20% so I can retire next year
