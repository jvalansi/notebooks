Hi what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
How was your day?
Sabba
I talked to the lawyer
He wants NIS 5,000
I&#39;ll talk to the last lawyer to get a quote and then we&#39;ll see
Good
I talked to the girl from Google
we will see what will be
Need to prepare
What else?
Please
How&#39;s work
Not easy
I have the project that ended this week
This thing of text normalization, that I have not yet finished what I had to do
And the lemmatization, which I also did not finish,
And I didn&#39;t really progress in transliteration either…
I&#39;m very slow
That the corona will end
I think it hurts me at work
I talked to the psychologist
I need to test this CBT
I can do this course בזה
interesting
It&#39;s good to see how the treatment goes
That is, what else?
It seems that the matter with the apartment has turned around
Maybe I&#39;ll wait another day, to see that the payment has passed
What more?
Bassa that I&#39;m now spending $ 5000 on this shit
Good
What more?
Do not know
What else is there?
lets see
To whom to donate?
Find an accountant
Study for an interview
The most important thing is to study for an interview right now
What about donating?
The desire to maximize human life - I do not know if happiness can be controlled
So contribute to what will increase human life with a minimum of money
Is there a difference between human lives? I do not think, is human life measured in money?
Maybe increasing human years, saving an old man is different from saving a child I guess
Good
How much to give?
Ten percent
But what about income tax, it&#39;s also give, it&#39;s over 30 percent and about a third of that goes to welfare
So come on I already give 10%
…
Ten percent of what I spend
Suppose one spends 6000, should donate 600
How much am I donating now?
35 each salary
To an organization that deals with heart problems, to Wikipedia and to Cannes Academic
1750 or almost 150 a month
I can double that
Donate another 25 against malaria, that&#39;s another 1250 a year,
3000 saves a human life, so every two and a half years I save a child, it&#39;s some 70 years of man, it&#39;s full
