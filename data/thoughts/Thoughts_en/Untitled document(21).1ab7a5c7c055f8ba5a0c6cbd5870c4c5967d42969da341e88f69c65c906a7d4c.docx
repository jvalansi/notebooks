Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
So there was a good question from the psychologist
What are the options and what are the pros and cons:
Leave the situation as it is
+ Chance for a family
+ Chance that no one was hurt
Chance of breaking up a family
Restrict to myself the freedom
+ Chance for a family
I have no freedom
divorce
+ Freedom
- No family soon
- Chances are Shiran has no family at all
I can try to put numbers
Family is not very important to me, but neither is not important to me, say 7
No one is hurt, do not know know whether to count it, it is not positive or negative (maybe 5)
Family breakup can be a very problematic event, maybe 2
For me to live without freedom is also very problematic, maybe 3
Freedom of divorce is greater than the freedom I have now, because I will hire can bring girls and such, so maybe 8
No family is the opposite of 7 so 3? If 5 is the middle
Chance that Sheeran has no family is also really problematic maybe 2
What are the chances?
I think that even if I get caught there is a chance that there will be a family, then it tends to be okay, let&#39;s say 30%, and the chance of me getting caught is in my opinion less than 50%, so let&#39;s say a total of 15%
85% that no one was hurt
The chance for a family is quite high, just depends on the effort we put in, so I would say at least 90%, and even 95%
The chance that Sheeran will not find someone else is quite low, say 10%, maybe 20% in the Worst Case, and then the chance that they will start a family maybe even higher than now, but let&#39;s say 95%,

So what are the numbers?
leave:
7
Mol: 0.15 * 2
סכה״כ:
7.3/1.15 = 6.34
limit
7
Opposite: 3
סכה״כ: 5
divorce
8
Opposite: 3 and 0.15 * 2
סכה״כ: 11.3/2.15 = 5.25

So it seems that staying that way is the most logical option
Divorce also has the economic interest
As long as there&#39;s nothing that makes me go, I stay I guess
Psychological thanks, it really helps the truth

What else?
Not too much
Still Paul Power on the interview in less than two weeks
Good
I have a plan
I feel like I&#39;m doing what I can for the interview, it&#39;s no longer in my hands what&#39;s going to happen I guess
I do my part, as long as everything goes well and there are no restraints
I would really love to be accepted
Lisa is not coming either, so I do not feel a tension between two options here
Sucks a bit how she plays me
I&#39;m ashamed that no one else flew over me
It seems to me that they are kicking me, but no one really comes and says
Maybe it&#39;s not something they say?
Do not know
I&#39;ll just come every week to someone I&#39;m most blunt about, even if I already was,
Maybe I should have gone to Christiana, what a worth
Just if I had already been and received the compliment, I would not receive any more information
Maybe but go again, show me if she&#39;s still bastardized…
If I went back
Because once really everyone flew at me
So what? This? Am I getting too old?
Zivna apologized and called him
What a soul this man is
He does not tell too many
I&#39;m not the truth either
Another reason for Google that I can come back with a job
