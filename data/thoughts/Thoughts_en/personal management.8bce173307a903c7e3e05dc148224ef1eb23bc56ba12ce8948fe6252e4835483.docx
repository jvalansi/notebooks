So according to the table it would be best to use wrike
I&#39;m still undecided
Really Wrike looks good
But a few things
Can I use it for work?
Can I use it for a project?
Can I use it with Sheeran?

It&#39;s okay I guess to separate tasks from projects
To manage my projects I can either use Gitleb or Beatback
I do not know of such a free version of Python
Then for tasks you can stick with Apple&#39;s&#39; tasks

If I really work in Beatback, then there are also two options:
Work with their regular issue tracker
Or work with jira
This JIRA is not bad at all, it came second on my lists

Another option was to use a trac or build something of my own

All the latest options (JIRA Trac or build something on your own) force me to pay for a monthly server

I think at the moment I will try to deal with the built-in service of Beatback, and with &quot;tasks&quot;


What&#39;s Hughes Case
I have a project let&#39;s say relocation
Inside there are sub-projects
For example, making a credit card (which is actually part of building credit)
Need to read a bit about credit cards (say 5 documents - an hour)
To make a credit card I need to do a card comparison
I need to compare the tickets from my bank (4) to the tickets from several sites (say 20)
I have to do Excel and choose
