Let&#39;s define
free will -
Choice - take a subset of given options
Free - in person, without the use of external force

Do we have the option to take a subgroup?
Without limiting generality let’s say it’s just taking one option out of two
Can we do that without external force?
Because we have internal loops, we are supposedly our own external force.

Can a coin fall on one side and not the other without external force?
I suppose so
There is a parallel world where the currency falls on the other side
Does the currency have a free choice?
The word &quot;conscious&quot; is missing in the definition of choice.
Conscious taking of a subgroup
A currency has a choice if it has consciousness

What is consciousness?
To be aware of something is to have knowledge about something
Does the currency have knowledge?
The computer has knowledge, is it aware?
Maybe this is the amount of possible situations in the system

They argue that choice is not taking a subgroup
Perhaps the word conscious is missing here
Are all elections conscious?
Suppose I choose something because I have a feeling about it, and not consciously, is it not a choice?
This too is a choice I guess
So there is no need to insert the word conscious
But then does a currency choose a side to fall on?
No
Currency can not choose, in the conventional sense
Why?
Because the currency has no desire
And what if choosing a computer?
Is it not a choice?
And what about the lottery, were the numbers chosen?


awareness
When claims it requires focus
The ability to focus on something
What is it to relax?
Choose something and concentrate on it
Pay attention
Be aware of one thing
But basically it&#39;s circular
The example he gave is Wikipedia
Is the Wikipedia server aware?
He has a lot of knowledge
But he does not dwell on anything
It could be argued that he is complacent about what is being asked of him
If I request certain information from Wikipedia the servers will fax over this information and return it to me
Is there a duty to focus on one thing?
And if I&#39;m an alien who can do two things at once
Or a robot with several cores
Are each of them aware that each of them is making a focus?
Is the difference that I can choose my focus?
Then we return to free choice
I do think we are machines
But then can we really change anything?
Are we quantum computers?

Maybe
But most of the scientific community seems to me not to think that way
That&#39;s not to say it&#39;s not true
