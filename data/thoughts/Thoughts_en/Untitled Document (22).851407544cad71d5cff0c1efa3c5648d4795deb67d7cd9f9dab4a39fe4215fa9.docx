Foods
40% of the difference
Half the money
Foods for children
K (HN -% * N)
Percent of the money less percent of the time I have
I wonder how many percent

2400 by 20000
So the percentage is something like 12%

So big time with a kid I spend half for a wife and kids

I think what is right is less than half in division
And much less than fifty percent
Maximum 25%
And that 25% also includes children
So 12% for her and 12% for the child

Good

What else?
Walla
Not too much
As always
Life just passes
That&#39;s a shame
This is my only life
What would I do differently?
If I were single, I would travel to Colombia every month
Maybe not every month but every three months, for a week like that,
Or maybe just traveling to Mexico
Maybe every month for some weekend

I probably can &#39;t do that
But I can once a month take a day off and go to someone
That it&#39;s probably not the same thing
But this is not a bad truth
It&#39;s still more fun than I was when I was single
I can live with that

Good
What else?
Nothing the truth
My mind is empty
I probably do not have enough experiences I feel
Where can I get experiences?
Maybe in a debate?

What else?
Not too much
I&#39;m really in love with this girl
do not know why
She&#39;s so beautiful
I&#39;m so superficial
But what can I do?
I can sign a financial agreement and cutâ€¦
That would be bad on my part
But is it not bad towards not doing it?
Not going with my heart?
Like I do not know if I will really be with her
There are many obstacles along the way
I know nothing about her
the location
the language
I do not know if you want me live
the age
It&#39;s really far
Also the fact that this is what she does for a living
This is a bit problematic
Also need a visa to get here
There are full of bodies
But that still means there is a situation where Sheeran is not the one
On the other hand I really do not know if one Ashley
I do not know if there is such a thing as one
It may be one in a million, but there are thousands

Good
What else?
Do not know
there&#39;s nothing
mere
Maybe I&#39;m depressed or something
Do not know why I do not have energy
I feel like I&#39;m living for retirement
That it&#39;s like waiting to finish school somewhere
Without great freedom
The truth in the military were ordinary every 4 months
Which is what I actually did
I was normal
Tachles being a dad is probably a lot more effort
Although I do not know
When the child is due to be born, I will probably have two or three years left
It&#39;s not that much to survive
I&#39;ll probably take some challah first, to decide if I&#39;m coming back
Probably for one quarter at first
Good
what else?
I do not yet know what the correct reasoning is for the half-half division
I would say I owe what is written
Half of what I have is about a quarter of a million dollars
It does not make sense
The truth is that you might also need to weigh some account that was there before, but it&#39;s a relatively small account
But I also bought the house from him
The most worthwhile thing for me is that Apple&#39;s stock account will remain mine
I would say that the joint account is common and everyone else is everyone else
Just as we do not want to consolidate accounts, so we do not have to consolidate in divorce
Good
Now the question is just when do I do it

Maybe tomorrow night
Maybe tonight
Do not know
Maybe I should play a little
Maybe a little paint
