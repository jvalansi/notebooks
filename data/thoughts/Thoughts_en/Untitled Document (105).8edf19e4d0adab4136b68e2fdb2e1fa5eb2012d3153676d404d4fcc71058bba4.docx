So I find a place with a ten percent rent dividend
Name Name 100000
Gets 10,000 a year
Two years later I can bring another apartment like this
Two years later I had another one and basically I finished
Then it&#39;s a passive income of 30,000
Along with the work it&#39;s 75000 it means that a year and a bit later I have a passive income of 40,000
Maybe 30,000 after tax
After another year it&#39;s 85000
It comes out 4 years to a minimum
Five and a half to 40,000
7 to 50,000
8 to 60,000
Spend 7 enough, 8 brings in 20000 gross, which is a lot
Here we spend about 60,000 a year, 5 a month
And it&#39;s a turn

How do I find an apartment
I need to understand a little bit about real estate
Maybe need a course
Or I go to some company and ask there
They have some interest
But I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a problem
I need to search the internet
