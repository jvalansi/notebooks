We agreed to put half in the shared account, so that should be split.
But I understand, this is not feasible, so I agree to add to that 25% of my accounts.

The other side is that Sheeran lost years of work
I do not necessarily agree with this argument
I think language should be no less difficult to find work.
There is a lot of supply here, the most in the world.
There is a lot of demand here but there is also a lot of demand in the country.
But Sabba let&#39;s say she was working at that time
She would probably work in the country and then earn half of what she earns here.
But Sabba, let&#39;s say she worked here, she probably would have earned what she got in the jobs she did, which is about half of what I earn.
The claim I got half at first is inaccurate.
My base salary was about half, but in addition to that I also received bonuses and options that roughly double the income, which other places do not get.
But Sabba, suppose she was earning as much as I did, so basically she should get what I saved in three years as compensation
This is of course ridiculous
So half?
But what about my compensation
For those three years I was the sole breadwinner
I paid a quarter of the income for it
So what&#39;s left of it is another quarter.
