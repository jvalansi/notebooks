I wish I could write code, which would give me a place to write documents and code, and run code
I can do such a thing
Using JavaScript, I can create a website that allows writing and saving documents
The site can sit in the cloud
I can allow this site to write sites as well, because in the end it&#39;s just adding JavaScript documents
But I need to understand how to create an application in Node JS
I can thus easily add more code to the app from within the app
I can add an address that for example uses Google Image to find a person by image or link (for example to Facebook) and then let&#39;s apply it in the direction of porn
But it&#39;s hard to learn this JS
I want to make a game out of it, that instead of doing anything I do when I play, I&#39;m going to do this thing in my game
Instead of writing I will do it in a game
What are the principles of play?
A sense of progress
Small steps (each step a few short minutes)
Suppose Candy Crush
There were full stages that each played five minutes
And within an average of the five turns that can be played, go through a step or two
Sachak had to play
5*700/2 = 1750
Games that is 8750 minutes or 146 hours
The task should be simple to perform it in five minutes, for example try to bounce a bird so that it does not touch the thorns
