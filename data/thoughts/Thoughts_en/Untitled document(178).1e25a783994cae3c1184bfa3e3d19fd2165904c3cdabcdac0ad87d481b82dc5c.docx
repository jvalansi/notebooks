I need to buy a house
All you have to do is see 100 houses
Bid on 10
Close with 1
big time

When I do 20 apartments in two hours, the total effort should not take more than ~ 10 hours
I think save it with api
But I do not know if it is really that critical
The main problem is that the rent costs a dollar to read
And I can test it alone in a rentometer, it takes a minute
The truth is that if I really think about it it&#39;s about 5-10 minutes of work per transaction
That is 6-12 trades per hour

How much is my minute worth?
I make 150,000 a year, (do not know whether to count the bonus or not)
12500 per month
625 per day
62.5 at
But about a third goes to taxes
It&#39;s 41 let&#39;s an hour
Is an hour out of work worth it like that?
I guess my work hour should be ~ $ 40 net…
It&#39;s not that much if you think about it…
It&#39;s also because I work ten hours, which is quite true I leave at eight and come back at seven, which is 11 hours including everything, but on the way back I do not exactly work…
That means 0.66 cents per minute

If something saves me ~ 5-10 hours it is worth $ 200-400
The question of whether it really is such a saver
Because I pay a dollar for a house, that means $ 100 in total
And that&#39;s without the other variables I need
That&#39;s another half dollar
