The closest way to overcoming death is through a chip that will connect to the brain

If this chip is similar enough to a brain cell, then we can replace a cell cell from the brain with an artificial chip, we&#39;m done, we&#39;ll live forever

Suppose an artificial neuron costs a million dollars (because it&#39;s a lab budget)
Every two years his price dropped by half, as long as Moore&#39;s Law.
In 40 years it costs a dollar.
Then at $ 80 billion you can build an artificial brain.
So double a small part, a quarter of a brain, $ 20 billion.
In 60 years it will cost 20 million
Walk is worth it.
Maybe this is how it will be possible to live forever
