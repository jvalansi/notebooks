I have no power for this life
do not know why
I&#39;m in a pretty promising situation in terms of the project
I believe I can make more than 12% if I work with news
I also might be able to do this if I work with xgboost on fundamental information
But that&#39;s not what&#39;s bothering me
I&#39;m not a social bastard
I&#39;m not dying for Sheeran
I&#39;m not dying for the &quot;cro&quot; here
Itzik quite bothers me to mix, because he speaks Hebrew
I guess you can get by with that
At work, meanwhile a spin, but I&#39;m afraid I will not really move team at the end of the project…
What bothers me the most I guess is Sheeran…
She&#39;s taking me energy, and I think I&#39;m her too
I do not have the strength to go home…
I do not know if it&#39;s specific to Sheeran
I guess with each one I would have had problems
I&#39;m less attracted to her now
She raised a little
But who would I replace her with?
Sivan, no
goddess? She has a girl, not that it&#39;s devastating, but surely sex will not be something
But this is true for every woman after pregnancy. I also do not know if she is interested
who else?
Itzik&#39;s gallbladder, no
Coastal? Do not know, a little stolen, and not reset, but do not know if it is so terrible, also do not know if she is interested.
Maybe the problem is monogamy…
what can we do?
Go to the strippers?
Do not know…
What does it help me to write all this?

I need mvp
All I need is to download all the daily information, and run the predictions on it
I can deal with improvements bro

What else?
How are you doing this fucking day?
Ssssemc
I feel like dying
And I do not know why
Hard with this stinking life
And they don&#39;t even stink like that
But that&#39;s the feeling
How to change this shit
Why he suffered
Why depression
what can we do?
meditation?
I would go home to shit but Sheeran might be there
If I get 12% credit
The problem is that I do not include taxes and inflation
If inflation is 2%, and taxes are 20% of profit, then to reach 10% I have to earn
I = (10+2)/.8=15%
Because then I earn 12 after tax, which is equal to 10 after lowering inflation

7 -&gt; After inflation 5 -&gt; After tax 4
12 -&gt; After inflation 10 -&gt; After tax 8
17 -> 15 -> 12
22 -> 20 -> 16
So for 10 I need something like 15 (14.5)

It&#39;s depressing…
