Hi, how’s it going?
Pretty good.
I had some good progress at work
Also excited about coming home and playing my favorite song on my guitar.
Also about working on the real estate research.
All I need is to add the expected rent to the mix to figure out the best location.
I also want to know if it’s landlord friendly.
I’m hoping to have over 10% returns.
There’s also neals offer, but I’m not sure I’ll get it.
I’m not officially accredited.
I can try to be with the free service. 
Either way I’m not in a rush.
The market might fall but hopefully not this year or beginning of next.
What else? Shiran is still stuck, still a bit annoying.
I have a bit of a sore throat.
Hope it’s nothing. I’ll wait a week hopefully it will pass.
What else?
I’m doing this tf course. Hope to apply it to my stock data.
If that works I don’t need real estate. I’d be so happy.
What else?
I’m thinking of taking a working from home day every month, to sit and work from the city (not actually from home because Shiran is there).
I’m also thinking of going to do some massage while there. Hopefully a full body, sensual massage. 
There are many options and I’m pretty sure I’ll get something good.
What else?
I don’t know…
What about happiness?
Are we giving this up?
I mean I think I’m good.
I’m not sure what happiness is.
I guess there are 2 types of happiness. One is the momentary happiness, like eating pizza, or orgasm, or drugs, which I guess is addictive (if you fill it you stay hungry, if you hunger it you stay full). And the other one is the continuous, being in the moment type happiness. Which I guess is awesome.
But I don’t think happiness is the most important thing. Sometimes we want to watch a sad movie, listen to a sad song, eat something bitter. We need all the colors of the rainbow.
What else?
Ummm…
Why worship.
Till now the best explanation comes from Sella.
Being in the moment as a way of life improves happiness.
How does that work with energy?
Well energy is there always. Energy is to time the same as momentum is to location. I don’t know eme hay that means exactly.
There’s time space and there’s frequency space. Being in singularity in time space, being now, let’s you be in all of frequencies space.
That’s interesting, I wish I could make it more scientific.
