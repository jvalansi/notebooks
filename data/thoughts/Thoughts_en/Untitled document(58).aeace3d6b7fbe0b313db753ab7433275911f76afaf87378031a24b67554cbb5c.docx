Hey whats up?
Everything is fine
What about you?
Sabba
I did not sleep well
This Ashley is driving me crazy
I showered in front of her yesterday
She was really cute
Although when she&#39;s not seeing me she&#39;s much less cute
Do not know what to do with her
I&#39;m really attracted to her
Not just in the segment of looks
Although it looks like fire
Also in the segment of character
As if she&#39;s depressed too
So do not know
But there is something in it
She&#39;s really trying to be a good guy
She always turns off the screen in private
Keeps the rules right
She&#39;s really pissed she&#39;s there
I do not know why it does this to me
I&#39;m not mad that I&#39;m there
maybe a little
I would have preferred live
Good
So do not know what to do
What will be will be
I really would like to keep in touch with her
Buy her a ticket here
Or travel to it
It can be a dream
What dreams do I already have?
Raise my mind to the cloud?
What else is there?
If I raise my mind to the cloud
I live forever and then I can do anything else I want
Yes
It&#39;s pretty much the only dream
Good
What else?
Do not know
What more?
Do not know
There was a lecture today he talked about blacks in America
On the debate over why blacks are in the situation they are in
He spoke out against the one-parent section
That in whites who choose not to marry no one raises an eyebrow
But it is not the same
When you grow up without a father you grow up differently
You have no man to keep you short
But why do they have single parenthood?
Is it because of incarceration?
Because of drugs?
I think so
Drugs lead to incarceration and lead to single parenthood
Legalization can help here
He did not talk about it
Nothing to do is not completely objective
Although I learned about the incarceration data from the course
I wonder why the episode did not talk about it
okay, well
What else?
How is the project?
This is not the day I was supposed to work on
I have it, I have something else, the truth is I&#39;m pretty done
I need to write down what I did
