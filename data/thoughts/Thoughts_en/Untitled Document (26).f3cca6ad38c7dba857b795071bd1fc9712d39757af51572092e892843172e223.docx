Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
What about you?
OK
So how was it?
There was a turn
I&#39;m glad I found what&#39;s bothering me
Don&#39;t know if I needed that much time
But I think it was positive
refreshing
Beauty
Want to give more details?
At first I could not sit without counting breaths
By the end I was already sitting a whole day without counting (roughly)
I&#39;m glad I realized that what bothers me is having a child without Sheeran working
I think the best thing would be to make a financial agreement

Good
what else?
Walla
Sabba
I think maybe I should get a haircut
The girl today said I was the engineer
And the escort girl
Do not know
There is a situation
Shorter
Was nice with the escort girl
With how much the girls on the site are worth at the end most of the time either I thought about her or Ashley
How beautiful this Ashley is
I can do someone else every month
Suppose it&#39;s around $ 400
That means 5,000 a year
That&#39;s another 50,000 in total
This is another half year of work
Obviously that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing
Maybe even 2
That&#39;s assuming I do 10%
If 8%
So 60 or so
Not terrible yet
In a year&#39;s work
I can earn two girls a month
fun

Good
As it looks now good condition
With the 500,000 I saved and another 300,000 waiting for me in the next three years, there is no reason I will not be a millionaire for another three or four years
I also save in addition to that
Some?
I have espp which is 10% of the salary on which I get 15% then 11.5% which is 16 thousand
And another 18,000 in pension provisions
That along with what Apple puts it is even more, something like 24
So 40 thousand, that means another 120 in three years
So a total of 420 thousand
I also expect the market to rise at this time
Although now I do not know how much it will cost
He looks pretty inflated
It is impossible to know, but I guess it will not rise as it has risen so far
So overall I expect to be worth over 900 thousand in another three years
And it makes sense to be in a million years bro
But that means another 4 years, not 3
How much can I expect the market to do?
The market has made 16% in the last year
There is a situation where next year will do nothing
A year ago he made 4%
And before 16%
Hard to know
Many also fear a recession
In short do not know what will be
If I assume an average of 8%
And in the last three years there has been an average of 12% I think in the next three very possible an average of 4%
That means 12% total
That it&#39;s supposed to get me to a million
With God&#39;s help
That still means working 3 years
That&#39;s fine
But it&#39;s still three four years
About 50 months
Maybe 40 and a bit
I will probably work until the age of forty at least
I guess at some point I will start to feel less stressed from work
Even now I&#39;m a little less stressed
Now I should be able to make 40,000 of the money I have
Or a little over 3,000 a month
That&#39;s enough to hold me
In total, I built on half a million shekels
So that I can live on 3,000 shekels a month
I now have 3.5 times that
That&#39;s great
But not yet free
I&#39;m just afraid that Sheeran will not find a job
Hence a prenuptial agreement
Good
What more
If not a financial agreement I guess we will split it all between the two of us and I will have half a million left for another three four years
That it&#39;s not terrible
But on that there are also the children
Q If we earn the same I do not know how much I will have to pay
It&#39;s by child custody time for sure
If it&#39;s half and half then probably nothing
But assuming 25% it means I will have to pay for the second part
Do not really know how it works
But if this child spends 3000 two children let&#39;s say 6000 I provide them with support a quarter of the time, I&#39;ll probably have to provide another quarter for the rest of the time
It&#39;s 1500 a month
That it&#39;s half of what I do out of the half a million I have left
I do not think they will take from me twice but it is impossible to know
I guess that would be half of it
That it&#39;s a basa
But not terrible
I&#39;ll have to keep working
Three more four two sure
Anyway
It still hasnâ€™t closed me the corner of the three four years until then

Well what else?
Not too much
I still do not have too much energy
