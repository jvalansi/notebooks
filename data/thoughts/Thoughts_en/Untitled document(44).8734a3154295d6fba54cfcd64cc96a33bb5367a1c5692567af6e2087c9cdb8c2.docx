Hey whats up?
Everything is fine
Tomorrow the freedom is over
I need to go through the emails
Maybe swap places with Sheeran
Maybe send Ashley the links
What more?
It is much
I also did not really finish the Litcode exercise
The program for the week?
There are enough things
Don&#39;t really need a plan
Need to take care of at home
Need to finish with the lawyer
And there is another complete todo list
Good
Thing thing

What&#39;s in the emails?
Mostly job offers
I have to say that as long as there is a corona I prefer not to go through
Except for Google
Maybe for trading
Although it&#39;s not really either
The problem is that there is still quite a lot to trade
Good
I can reject them too
Yes
I do not really want trading
Good
Besides, there are emails from the mail
There are courses
Has the youtube api
Weekly Torah Portion
Startup School
Self-measurement of computational learning

That&#39;s about it
Two three from each amounts to some 20
Good
What else?

It&#39;s mostly the house stabbing me it seems to me
What to do?
Maybe I should just invest in a management company
Although a management company will also involve me
For example if a paint job needs to be done
Or what happens to the tenants
Stuff like that
Semc
Maybe just sell it
I need to see how much I make from the mortgage
Good
What else?
Or do i need cpa
How do I find cpa?
Maybe I need one in the app
Maybe
By and large it sounds like the app I make taxes through

What more?
Do not know
What is?
