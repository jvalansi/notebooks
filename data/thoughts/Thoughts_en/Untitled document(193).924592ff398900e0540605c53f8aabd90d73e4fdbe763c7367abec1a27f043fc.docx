I want a better platform to put these things
I want to work on the project
I have to decide on an apartment in SF
What more?
I need to get rid of repetitive work at work
Relocation

I do not know what to do…

Because I have so many things to do I do nothing…

I&#39;m kicking the Reminders
But I can not do everything there, because if there will be a day that I do not have an iPhone, then I can not move

I have so many tasks…

I need order

By and large there are several types of tasks:
Of money
Working
Relocation
Fluent
project
health
doctor
Rufesh


My tasks are in many places
Work-related tasks are found in Reminders, Radar, and Safari (all reading materials).

Relocation has a deadline, so it&#39;s quite a priority

At work I have an encyclopedia, conversion, speech, bugspray, grading
Tachles encyclopedia is very important because it is for all languages
Conversion is important right now, because it&#39;s in focus
Grading is very important because it is at the end of the real index
Bagspray is important because it allows for quick repair for everyone
Speech is important because there are a lot of problems there

The project should check the update from ib
