I would be happy if I had some notebook that always works that I can turn on from my cell phone
It seems to me Google is giving such a service
Semc
It&#39;s always them
Why they win everything
I can pay Amazon about ten dollars a month to get something without too much computing power
But that should be enough
The notebook interface on the cell phone is also not something
It is also not that convenient to write code on a cell phone
Because you have to constantly move to the signs

How to solve it
Why do you need two devices one with a big screen and a keyboard and one with a small screen
After all, the big one is also mobile
But not that mobile
He did not fit in his pocket
As if in the middle there is an iPad
And an iPad with a good keyboard will have a situation that is enough
Because computing power can be in the cloud
An iPad is really more portable than a computer
But much less than a cell phone
If I had a mobile keyboard for my cell phone?
Comes with a dual screen or even 1.5 I would settle for
And what do you do with the keyboard?
