Assumptions:
The particle fits through the doorway with epsilon degrees wiggle room
This means that the probability that a particle that approaches the (center of the) doorway crosses it is (without the door itself), is epsilon/180
The door opens up to 90 degrees to one side only.
The door’s mass is negligible (does not change the course of the particle).

The probability to cross with the direction of the door:

Say there’s epsilon degree in which the ball can pass then the probability of a particle, that goes towards the door, to pass is epsilon/180 (probability that the ball is heading the right direction)

The probability to cross against the direction of the door:

Say there’s epsilon degree in which the ball can pass then the probability of a particle, that goes towards the door, to pass is epsilon/90 (probability that the door is sufficiently open) times epsilon/180 (probability  that the ball is heading the right direction)

In total there’s 90/epsilon times more chance that a particle will cross with the direction of the door than against it.
