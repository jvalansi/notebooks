Dear diary
JK
Why do I feel critical?
Am I just repeating the words I hear every day?
There is a big situation
You can check:
Record all the words that go through my mind
As I do now
And compare to the distribution that appears in the media (let&#39;s say movies)
And see how different the distribution is
Then need to check if the rest of the difference is explained by other factors (probably family friends work)
And surely there is also a percentage that just comes from within

Clearly there is a very strong external influence
You can check if it is linear for the amount of time
The more I work with, the more my language will be
As much as I am with friends this will be my language
The more I am with myself, the more my language will be

Pretty

What now?
That&#39;s why I have to stop working

How inflation is zero and housing prices are sky high

how?
Housing prices are rising:

And labor prices:

So it&#39;s not just labor prices
Just prices went up
If the price goes up by about one percent, then with a pretty solid investment you make 5% (because the bank leverages 80%)
And more rent dividends, say four percent
Which is 9%
This is not bad
And more solid than the capital market
The question is whether he will continue like this
Because right now rentals look pretty cheap
When does it become unequal?
The truth that making a 4% solid always seems pretty worthwhile
So why not
I specifically hope for more than 4%
But it turns out that whoever does it does not seem to me to suffer

How do housing prices rise and the price index not?

Price index:


The truth was there was deflation then
So there is an interest in the price index going up

The interest rate made by the bank should also be lowered

If the bank makes one percent, and I make one percent, then I earn 4 percent instead of 5, no?
It still comes out 8%
That&#39;s good in a big way
And this is where inflation comes from

Interest rates are linked to inflation and house prices are linked to interest rates
Inflation rises when house prices rise, house prices rise when interest rates are low because it is worth buying, when interest rates are low inflation
How does it work?
