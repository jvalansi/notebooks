Is man allowed from the beast?
Through words, man is able to shrink information,
Instead of a picture that takes up a lot of space, a person can save the information as a word, which takes up very little space,
So a person has more information in his head, and that way he has more energy

A word can cause an atom bomb to explode (&quot;Fire!&quot;)
Is there a limit to the equivalence between information and energy?
Maybe a word only allows energy routing,
It does not exactly create energy, but it is able to release energy
