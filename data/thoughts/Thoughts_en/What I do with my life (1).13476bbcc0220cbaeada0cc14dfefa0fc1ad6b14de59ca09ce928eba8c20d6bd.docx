What do I do with my life?

I want to make this thing work.
How do I know it works?
The expectation looks good, how do I know what the risk is?
The Worst Case Scenario does not scare me
If I lose everything I gained, it will bother me.
But this is not the Worst Case, I can also equally say that I should not get in a car. I need to look at 3 standard deviations below average.
It&#39;s like tossing a coin
What is the standard deviation of the trinity?
What is a standard deviation?
The root of variance
What is different
The span of the centered variable square
In fact, this standard deviation is the average of the distances from the average
So what is the average of the distances of coin tossing?
If a tree is one and a 1-fold then the average is one, no?
E[x]=P(-1)*-1+p(1)*1=0
E [(XE [x]) ^ 2] = p (-1) * - 1 ^ 2 + p (1) * 1 ^ 2 = 0.5
s[x]=sqrt(0.5)= 0.7
