By and large I do a year ~ 150k
One-third taxes
A third of expenses
One-third savings

20 from RSU before tax, assume it is 13.5 after tax
And 130 salary
In salary I get 5 every two weeks
Of these, 1.5 taxes
.5 on ESPP
.3 about 401k
Apple doubles that for me
So I save 1.1 every two weeks that year it&#39;s 13 and it&#39;s supposedly after tax
In the end I have about 2.6 left in my pocket, that&#39;s about 66 a year, 5.5 a month
Expenses are supposed to be 4 a month, but come out 5
Maybe it&#39;s going to get better as we move
