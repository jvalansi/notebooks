What do I have in mind?
politics
Who is Ann voting for?
Unknowingly, everyone is slaughtered
I need to do some brief research on the cost of housing prices
That&#39;s Saul&#39;s thing most disturbing, fucking 3,000 per apartment is madness
Besides this part of going through steps to give myself motivation, I need to divide things up for goals and give percentages
Then I really feel like I&#39;m undergoing Achievements
And give a realistic time frame
Although I do not know if times are the most important thing
I have to look in which direction I am going
I have too many options and I do not know what to choose
I do not even know what is important to me
At some level I have to make money, a certain amount to survive
I also want to study, but I do not know if it is worth within a framework
I also do not want to suffer I want I can lift my head to think
Interesting to know code writing especially on the subject of web development
I&#39;m interested in the mind
I do not know if it has any purpose, maybe it&#39;s far from that thing
I do not know
Basically I have to earn something like 5,000 to own myself
And another 5,000 for each offspring
Although even 5,000 for me I do not know if it is so realistic
How do I earn 5,000 in something I love
I need to see if I can get it as a freelancer
The problem is that as a freelancer I do not put anything into retirement

What interests me
What do I think about most of the time?
What are the concepts that appear most in my writing?
Truth is a whore&#39;s way of knowing what interests me most
The truth that interests me is how the brain works
I think in the future we will not need people, the ideas will live on another platform
I&#39;m interested in politics
I&#39;m interested in economics
I like to write code
I like to philosophize
I like to ask questions


I want a job where I can also work on whatever I want
I want a job where I will earn at least 12 net at some point (I need 5, for two kids I need another 5, and for another one sometime 2.5)
I want something that will interest me

Well I need to think about options:
Brain research
Political Science
economy
Web development
Data Security
business management

I need to rate the options in the ways I care:
Interest
Match
Of money
Free time

I have to give importance to every exam:
Most important interest - 10
Then free time - 8
Then money - 7
And adjustment - 6

I should rate each option with the above ratings:

I want a part-time job so that I can also develop personally into what interests me
Therefore the two main options are either research (and scholarship) or web development
If I go to brain research or web development, I lose the direction of economics and social sciences / country, and vice versa
So maybe it&#39;s really better to find some part time job in web development
