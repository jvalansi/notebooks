A container is divided into two
On one side large and slow and small and fast particles
An empty second side
The partition moves only small particles (like a strainer)
So at the end on one side the speed is higher
Entropy went down without investing energy
The transition can be made asymmetrical, for example a lot of holes on one side that merge except for holes on the other side
