Happiness: the general feeling of well-being. If joy is a weather then happiness is a climate.

Nothing is important.
What is important?
Money? No
Intelligence?
Love?
God?
The country?
The people?

Can I think of times when I was happy?
I can think of times when I was sadder than usual.
When we moved from the Kibbutz, when I was in high school, The army, 
I guess that means I was happier in the Kibbutz, at school, and after the army…
I had sad moments, but I guess I had more happy moments.

If I choose happiness I choose the blue pill, I choose to have a comfy, happy life, choosing the red pill might be much harder, but it’s the truth.
If I choose the blue pill I’ll always know I’m missing out, it will probably always bother me.
So it’s not a happy life then…

I’d rather talk about minimizing pain then maximizing happiness. Because pain stays, happiness goes away at some point.
