I can make a one-year schedule according to the decisions
The daily schedule is known (guitar / palms / bible)
Monthly schedule: (Mitap Real Estate, Mitap Natural Language)
The quarterly schedule is also known: (Kagel Challenge, course, project)
What is the weekly schedule?
I can either do a Kegel challenge or a course or a project
What I want
If I have a better idea than Brock
Each of these I have to budget a month and plan a week
Which course? Arabic, natural language, computational learning?
What project? Stock forecasting by news? Stock prediction by fundamental analysis? Bot Q&amp;A?
Which kegel?
It seems to me the best way is this: Course -&gt; Kegel -&gt; Project
