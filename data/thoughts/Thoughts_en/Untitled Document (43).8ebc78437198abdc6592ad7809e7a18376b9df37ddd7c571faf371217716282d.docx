Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
Not too much
What about you?
Also, everything is good
What are you telling?
Not too much
I worked a lot today because there is something we are under pressure to achieve
Probably tomorrow too I will have to work on it
Hope I succeed
I canceled my interview today
A little annoying
This created a situation where I did not exercise today
I talked to Ziv Atonement about him
We talked about my project
He wasted it
But I did not have time today to work on the project
With the help of the name another 100 salaries or 50 months I&#39;m out
It&#39;s quite a bit of time
at all
It&#39;s 4 years
But what can be done
Better than 40
Actually 30
And what until then will I suffer every day?
I think part of it I suffer because I&#39;m at home
Mostly I suffer because I only get negative pressure from Peter
It is unpleasant and does not make you want to work
I do not know if it is worth working with him even though the project is interesting
Good looks
The project I am working on is also interesting
I can work on it in code week
I also wanted to work on music production
I can also post it anonymously
Just to see what happens
I do not know if anything came of it
By and large if 1000 views is a dollar, then if I get to a million views a day it should not work anymore
A million daily users is a lot
But it is certainly possible
Also an experience
Good
what else?
Do not know
I have nothing more
There&#39;s about 50 months until my 40th birthday
I guess that&#39;s the countdown
Okay
Ummm
It seems to me Leah was turned on by me
Sabba
I do not have much to do with it
Maybe if Sheeran would ever agree to an exchange or orgy
low chance
Maybe at Burning Man
Cool
What else is there in this life?
If millions of dollars do not help, what does?
Maybe live forever
Maybe live in the cloud
But right now I have nothing to contribute to it
Maybe as an electrical engineer
By and large I was an electrical engineer
But do not know if it interests me
It connects electrodes to neurons in a big way
And it will cost quite a bit of money
So only if I have that money can I participate, unless they get me there
Maybe
