Tell me something
What’s interesting to me
What would I like to know
Nothing is important
What can I do for the rest of my life?
How does the best day of my life look like?
Cocaine and hookers?
Weed and video games?
Mushrooms and meditation?
Coffee and jerusalem post?

What bothers me the most?
Work?

In 4 years I should be free
4 years is a lot, but it’s not that bad…

What’s a perfect day for me?
Just relax and do nothing?
Explore the outdoors with someone I love?
Solve a problem for humanity?
Create an AI?
