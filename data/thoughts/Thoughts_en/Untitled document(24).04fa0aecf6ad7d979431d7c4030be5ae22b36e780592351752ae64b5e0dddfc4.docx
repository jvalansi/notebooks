So I had a list of questions to get to know a man
Like the Akintor
Section, the first question of the Akintor is whether the character is from Harry Potter
Apparently many think first of such a character
Good
So Lisa really likes me especially
Ace Laver told me
Atonement for her
I really do not know what to do with her
I guess until you come here I really have no way of knowing how our chemistry is
If the chemistry is good, then I think I&#39;ll have to leave
I do not think I will marry her, I have quite learned my lesson
And what if Sheeran is pregnant
So it&#39;s more of a problem to leave…
Good
Hope you arrive as soon as possible
But it is impossible to know with her
Good
What else?
Hasn’t changed too much since we talked yesterday
Want to continue the list of questions?
Interesting situations is movies
One can also ask what is humanity&#39;s biggest problem and how would we solve it
Okay
I wonder if the questions can be divided somehow
Maybe I need a dedicated document for this

Good
So there are some axes on which it works
Especially at what level it is
The majority are desires on different levels, like hunger or disgust on the physical level, love or hate on the emotional level, and desires on the mental level like acceptance, or vice versa.
There is also trust, or confidence that it is a kind of emotion, or perhaps a lack of emotion of fear, which is one of the options between fight or flight

Well what do I do with the interview?
I can check how many different products of are built
I see a lecture every day
I need to look for questions

I can do the test of work
And there&#39;s another similar test in my email
One day for that, one day for that
What more?
Maybe Kegel&#39;s questions:
!
Specific:
!
!

Write down a code
I would love Michal&#39;s tips…
I&#39;ll turn to her tomorrow

What more?

For learning systems design, I can look at all kinds of systems and how they are built
Maybe really look at how Google Transliteration works, or Google Assistant, or Alexa, or Duplex, systems that work on text
Two sets a day, 10 sets this week and I&#39;m done
