What is inflation?
The bank prints more money
Is this money going to more loans?
People have more money available
Demand increases (demand curve increases)
Prices are going up

If you want more people you will have to increase the demand or increase the supply
If you want the price to go down, you have to increase the supply

I&#39;m still not closed on how the money goes from the bank that prints it to the public.
This could be if the printing bank transfers to the government, which decides to subsidize some service for example

to do:
Install everything on the bottle v
Clean the old
Documents for the apartment:
Insurance
tax
Install on the iPad in a new child
Clear
Project v
Things for distance
Shopping v
Get a haircut v
Account Status v
Need to do some sort of private stack overflow that I ask questions and then answer inside
options:
Use some open source stack overflow
Write everything down in documents in Drive
Use asana for this
Use the tasks of the iPhone

Pros and Cons
Add more stack overflow it&#39;s a bit over cool I also need a server to store it
Registering in Drive is convenient and accessible from anywhere
Asana coordinates all the private tasks but she is not yet fully baked and I need the tasks as well
I try not to use tasks for private things

Well then drive

I also want to get rid of all the open tabs
And from all emails
And of all missions

Right now most of my private life is concentrated in this apartment in Florida

What are my goals for the year?
I want to buy 2 apartments that will bring me ~ $ 600 a month
If I do it every year within 7 years I&#39;m done
If $ 700 within 6
$ 800 within 5, that&#39;s if I manage to raise enough money to buy 2 every year
It is not so feasible, but in 4-5 years it will be feasible
So it&#39;s 2 year, maybe 2 next year, brother 1, 1, then again 1 or 2 and then 2
And we finished within 5-6

I have no more destinations?
I want to be free, so that&#39;s all I see
There is also the section of children
There is also the section of computerized learning
I want to do the last Andrew Ing course

I want to save at least 40k
Inhaling 48k, and taking out 48k
I&#39;m currently spending 60, and it seems to me that a lot of it is because of the apartment
Need to move to Berkeley

I want to centralize my lists
Asana is not baked enough it feels, I am missing the reminders, it also does not appear in the diary properly, and the logic of recurring reminders is not good
I would be happy if it was open source, best Python, and I could contribute


What&#39;s the big picture?
Do not know
I just want to be free
Now I give the 8-18 Monday through Friday to work
It&#39;s 50/168 = ~ one - third
I also give 8 hours out of 24 for sleep, that&#39;s another third
What do I have left?
a third?
My 62 hours?
And I&#39;m half working on them

My head is full
It seems to me because of real estate

All tabs open
I&#39;m trying to find out which virtual broker to use
There is the strength finder looking for strengths, which is one of the bestsellers
Look at yelp understand the division into business

I can not add a bookmark because it is not a safari
In essence it should be upside down I need to add everything to Firefox

But when do I read it all…
I have too much Todo
Everything in Asana
The open tabs
The emails I did not finish
Real estate investments

So how do I close everything?

What do I do with the tabs?
The emails?
How I arrange the investments, it comes as a relative surprise
How do I organize the information?

I have to read from a reading list every day, not of work, of home
It&#39;s the tabs
The emails?
I can keep them, but when do I take care of them?
In essence it is a stamp as in work

Real estate investments just happen

what&#39;s going on?
Walla
There&#39;s someone here talking really loud and I do not know where
In small
What else?
Walla
Not too much
Sabbath
Trying not to do much
I do not know what to do

I can work on the project from the iPad
I do not know if I want to work on the project
Takes them full time to send confirm to me to upload videos
It does not block me
but
Shorter does not know
What else needs to be done?
I saw some YouTube
A little more lunch
I just finished breakfast
Good
I would have sex if Sheeran had not been nervous about me
Maybe in the evening
I&#39;m a little tired
From the divorce to Lag
A kind of intermediate state between awake and old

If I take a dictionary definition and try to predict the word, or vice versa
To get the correct representation of the word

I want to manage projects well

I centralize the money and make 6% annually

How do I insure the money?

The market rises by an average of 8% percent per year
But there could be a year where it drops by 50%

I want insurance for this year
That if the money falls by 50% I get the money back
How do you do that?
If I agree to commit to selling all my shares at the end of the year at their price + 7%?
Most years I will lose the difference (but I will still make 7%) but in the year of the fall I will not fall

I can pay 0.65% on the chance of falling 4/70 ~ = 5% in a third of a year
This year
1.0065^3=~2%
1.05^3=~16%
I mean I pay 2% so as not to fall more than 16%

In seven months the numbers are 0.9% on the chance of falling 10%
This year:
1.009^2=~1.8%
1.1^2=~21%


With the options, the expectation is:
8-2 = 6%
With the bonds:
8*¾+2.5*¼=6.6%
But the biggest fall with options will be 20%
And with bonds it can be 50 * ¾ = 37.5%


What about the project?
I hope I can use rest api from aws or something
Otherwise I will have to do it manually…
By and large if I manage to make 18% I am technically free in something like a year
400 thousand double 18%, that&#39;s some 72k
I would really love to finish if the money part already…

what else?
How is everything?
Sabba
A little stressed at work
But I have to push back
I talked to the parents
They prefer to talk on Saturday
Sabba
I need to talk to my sisters
In Israel, what will I do?
Will I be with my parents all the time?
I&#39;m freaking out…

Good flow…

What else?
What else is on the agenda?
There&#39;s Joey&#39;s party tomorrow
I do not know if I want to go
Feels a little redundant to me…
Maya also has a birthday
It bothers me less for some reason
Maybe because I&#39;m more myself with them
The more I am, the more I turn to myself
But I&#39;m most alone…


Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
Not too much
What about you?
Also, everything is good
What are you telling?
Not too much
I worked a lot today because there is something we are under pressure to achieve
Probably tomorrow too I will have to work on it
Hope I succeed
I canceled my interview today
A little annoying
This created a situation where I did not exercise today
I talked to Ziv Atonement about him
We talked about my project
He wasted it
But I did not have time today to work on the project
With the help of the name another 100 salaries or 50 months I&#39;m out
It&#39;s quite a bit of time
at all
It&#39;s 4 years
But what can be done
Better than 40
Actually 30
And what until then will I suffer every day?
I think part of it I suffer because I&#39;m at home
Mostly I suffer because I only get negative pressure from Peter
It is unpleasant and does not make you want to work
I do not know if it is worth working with him even though the project is interesting
Good looks
The project I am working on is also interesting
I can work on it in code week
I also wanted to work on music production
I can also post it anonymously
Just to see what happens
I do not know if anything came of it
By and large if 1000 views is a dollar, then if I get to a million views a day it should not work anymore
A million daily users is a lot
But it is certainly possible
Also an experience
Good
what else?
Do not know
I have nothing more
There&#39;s about 50 months until my 40th birthday
I guess that&#39;s the countdown
Okay
Ummm
It seems to me Leah was turned on by me
Sabba
I do not have much to do with it
Maybe if Sheeran would ever agree to an exchange or orgy
low chance
Maybe at Burning Man
Cool
What else is there in this life?
If millions of dollars do not help, what does?
Maybe live forever
Maybe live in the cloud
But right now I have nothing to contribute to it
Maybe as an electrical engineer
By and large I was an electrical engineer
But do not know if it interests me
It connects electrodes to neurons in a big way
And it will cost quite a bit of money
So only if I have that money can I participate, unless they get me there
Maybe

So I had a list of questions to get to know a man
Like the Akintor
Section, the first question of the Akintor is whether the character is from Harry Potter
Apparently many think first of such a character
Good
So Lisa really likes me especially
Ace Laver told me
Atonement for her
I really do not know what to do with her
I guess until you come here I really have no way of knowing how our chemistry is
If the chemistry is good, then I think I&#39;ll have to leave
I do not think I will marry her, I have quite learned my lesson
And what if Sheeran is pregnant
So it&#39;s more of a problem to leave…
Good
Hope you arrive as soon as possible
But it is impossible to know with her
Good
What else?
Hasn’t changed too much since we talked yesterday
Want to continue the list of questions?
Interesting situations is movies
One can also ask what is humanity&#39;s biggest problem and how would we solve it
Okay
I wonder if the questions can be divided somehow
Maybe I need a dedicated document for this

Good
So there are some axes on which it works
Especially at what level it is
The majority are desires on different levels, like hunger or disgust on the physical level, love or hate on the emotional level, and desires on the mental level like acceptance, or vice versa.
There is also trust, or confidence that it is a kind of emotion, or perhaps a lack of emotion of fear, which is one of the options between fight or flight

Well what do I do with the interview?
I can check how many different products of are built
I see a lecture every day
I need to look for questions

I can do the test of work
And there&#39;s another similar test in my email
One day for that, one day for that
What more?
Maybe Kegel&#39;s questions:
!
Specific:
!
!

Write down a code
I would love Michal&#39;s tips…
I&#39;ll turn to her tomorrow

What more?

For learning systems design, I can look at all kinds of systems and how they are built
Maybe really look at how Google Transliteration works, or Google Assistant, or Alexa, or Duplex, systems that work on text
Two sets a day, 10 sets this week and I&#39;m done


Why cut it and also (and) and union it or (or)
This and that, means out of everything you will leave what is this and that, and you will not leave this and that
This or that, means out of everything you will leave what is or this or that or both, and will not leave one of the two
A&B : {x: x in A and x in B}
    not {x: x in A or x in B}
A|B : {x: x in A or x in B}
    not : {x: x in A and not in B}  or {x: x in B and not in A} but not both

A|B ~= A+B
A&B ~= A*B
Foods
40% of the difference
Half the money
Foods for children
K (HN -% * N)
Percent of the money less percent of the time I have
I wonder how many percent

2400 by 20000
So the percentage is something like 12%

So big time with a kid I spend half for a wife and kids

I think what is right is less than half in division
And much less than fifty percent
Maximum 25%
And that 25% also includes children
So 12% for her and 12% for the child

Good

What else?
Walla
Not too much
As always
Life just passes
That&#39;s a shame
This is my only life
What would I do differently?
If I were single, I would travel to Colombia every month
Maybe not every month but every three months, for a week like that,
Or maybe just traveling to Mexico
Maybe every month for some weekend

I probably can &#39;t do that
But I can once a month take a day off and go to someone
That it&#39;s probably not the same thing
But this is not a bad truth
It&#39;s still more fun than I was when I was single
I can live with that

Good
What else?
Nothing the truth
My mind is empty
I probably do not have enough experiences I feel
Where can I get experiences?
Maybe in a debate?

What else?
Not too much
I&#39;m really in love with this girl
do not know why
She&#39;s so beautiful
I&#39;m so superficial
But what can I do?
I can sign a financial agreement and cut…
That would be bad on my part
But is it not bad towards not doing it?
Not going with my heart?
Like I do not know if I will really be with her
There are many obstacles along the way
I know nothing about her
the location
the language
I do not know if you want me live
the age
It&#39;s really far
Also the fact that this is what she does for a living
This is a bit problematic
Also need a visa to get here
There are full of bodies
But that still means there is a situation where Sheeran is not the one
On the other hand I really do not know if one Ashley
I do not know if there is such a thing as one
It may be one in a million, but there are thousands

Good
What else?
Do not know
there&#39;s nothing
mere
Maybe I&#39;m depressed or something
Do not know why I do not have energy
I feel like I&#39;m living for retirement
That it&#39;s like waiting to finish school somewhere
Without great freedom
The truth in the military were ordinary every 4 months
Which is what I actually did
I was normal
Tachles being a dad is probably a lot more effort
Although I do not know
When the child is due to be born, I will probably have two or three years left
It&#39;s not that much to survive
I&#39;ll probably take some challah first, to decide if I&#39;m coming back
Probably for one quarter at first
Good
what else?
I do not yet know what the correct reasoning is for the half-half division
I would say I owe what is written
Half of what I have is about a quarter of a million dollars
It does not make sense
The truth is that you might also need to weigh some account that was there before, but it&#39;s a relatively small account
But I also bought the house from him
The most worthwhile thing for me is that Apple&#39;s stock account will remain mine
I would say that the joint account is common and everyone else is everyone else
Just as we do not want to consolidate accounts, so we do not have to consolidate in divorce
Good
Now the question is just when do I do it

Maybe tomorrow night
Maybe tonight
Do not know
Maybe I should play a little
Maybe a little paint


so what are we doing?
I need to find a new deal
Unfortunately this will be my occupation this week
Too bad
I could finish with that already…
It is currently taking priority

third
50k
For a 100k house
10% rent
1% insurance 
1% tax
This is actually a segment that Sheeran keeps in touch with Ex
She&#39;s never been around with me staying in touch with an ex
no chance…
Tachles has a situation where they just had to stay
I just got into a situation…
As if it does not bother me
A bit disturbing obviously
Because a girl who keeps in touch with X, there&#39;s probably something there
Man what does he care to keep in touch with exes…
And more than that, she is also the one who addresses him…
ססעמק
Annoying
As if for me you would go with him
I&#39;ll get freedom
Just harassing the ego
That she prefers it
segment
I do not have too much to do
It&#39;s her decision
I&#39;m not going to decide for her what to do
Like I&#39;m not expecting her to tell me what to do
Fulfilled if I could I also keep in touch with exes
But I have no one
I would show her what it looked like from the side
Maybe this is why there is monogamy?
Once upon a time when we lived in small communities, Exim was really personal
You could not just say goodbye and that&#39;s it
You&#39;ll still see the man forever
Look who they are with now
And they will see you
You will always be there, and they will always be there
So monogamy is a bit of a hindrance to the situation
What a long word for something simple
Maybe an event, or a situation is better

Well do not know
I have nothing to think about

Gadkhalham
The ratio of forces is the speed of light
This is the ratio of energy - e = mc ^ 2


The situation where everyone is selfish (individualism) is evolutionarily unstable because it gives way to those who do organize and is not selfish to take over
Nothing can completely disappear when it has an advantage

Hey whats up?
Everything is fine
What about you?
Sabba
Had a nice day with Lisa
We laughed a little
I laughed at her
Such a cutie
At work, there is something I volunteered to do
That I&#39;m really pissed off about him
But I do not have too much to do with it
I still have a lot of things to do
I&#39;m still trying the investment strategy
Do not know what I was trying to achieve with the data I added
It does not really give too much
I already had a history of 20 years
That should be enough
Most companies do not hold more than that
Good
What else?
Do not know
I might need to take care of the taxes
I pay a lot of tax
This is something that if I save can really change
That&#39;s a third of the salary
If I earn another third it&#39;s great
That&#39;s another half of the truth
That&#39;s a lot
Yes it&#39;s next in line on the list I guess
I have to do the Beck Generation
I have no strength for it because it&#39;s boring
But should
So what about the investment strategy?
Do not know
Will we give up?
Do not know
what is the plan?
Do not know
Good
What else?
Do not know
Some of the things I do
acupuncture
Trying to get into Google
Learning chess
Besides the preference for couple therapy and a financial agreement
I also need to take care of the license
And in my teeth
It is not over
Take care of taxes
Invest in startups
All kinds of things related to money
All kinds of things related to learning
These are the two main things
I do not have time for everything
One project at a time
Now there are two truths, it&#39;s a prenuptial agreement and couple therapy
Your brother needs to take care of taxes
Maybe do some course
Annual expense analysis
Also important
And what about the investment strategy?
Give up?
The idea is to invest in what has historically maximized the safe pace of attraction
But there is no correlation between this and the increase in value
So I do not know if it is relevant…
That&#39;s a good idea for sure
An interesting idea
And surely there is also more to think about the way the calculation of the 5th percent
I need to check if it really fits the value of one-sixth of the returns
By and large I feel like one should just look at Sharp
And maybe maximize it
But it&#39;s starting to get complicated
Then I think the best is the simplest
If I minimize losses (to tax) I earn more than trying to maximize the return
And it&#39;s much easier and safer
So just learn about this generation Beck
If I put in another 15,000 a year, it&#39;s very nice
The truth is that it&#39;s not as much as I thought
Because even one percent raise in attraction is worth much more than that
But 15 thousand a year, double three years, 45 thousand, is good money
Actually I do not even know if it saves tax
There is a situation that it just earns without tax…
There is a situation
Okay
Well I&#39;ll read about it
Anyway the investment strategy is still interesting
But need to sleep



I do not know
It seems to me that it is slower to write like this
I would have preferred to dictate, but the cockroaches listen to it
I can dictate in English, but I think I think more slowly in English

How do I make the morning more productive?
I don't know
I only in Geror and Facebook
Facebook calling an hour and a half
Do a lingo half an hour
I want to be productive

Sometimes I use GarageBand

I would write about politics but it&#39;s just messy

I would like to arrange everything I write automatically
It should not be very difficult to make a classification for paragraphs

What function is there between phrases
Suppose a table, it is an elevated surface, how can I attach the vector of a surface to the vector of an elevated to create a table

Connection seems to be working,
For example: a king consists of, among other things, a male, and if a male is missing, and we add a female, we get a queen

But there are words that are an operator, for example no, say no male, is it female?

Good
So we&#39;re here and it&#39;s already clear
so what are we doing
I can drive home to get luggage
I can ask for luggage from the store
Good
so what are we doing
How long is it for the cell?
an hour and a quarter
From the parents it is an hour and a half
what is the plan?
Economic analysis
What else?
a question
Good
So I charge the device
What now?
Why do you always need something now?
Why not just anything…
I do not know if I&#39;m still hungry or not
Maybe I should have traveled with the destination
I just preferred not to
I wanted an hour to myself
Not a social hour
But it does not give too much
What am I already doing at this time?
What else to do…
Good question
If I had all the money
what am I doing?
I have no idea
Don&#39;t know if I&#39;m even resigning
The options is what I wrote down
Or just swimming with the current
Or make music with computational learning
or
So in a year I get 165k
I work ±250 days (~365/7*5)
So every day I bring home 165k/250~=660$
Every hour (i work ~8 hours)  is ~80$
A third goes to taxes so more like 440$, or ~60$ an hour, or ~1$ a minute…
I save half let’s say, so 220 a day, or 55k a year

Every month I spend ~5k, or ~166 a day, or ~230 if I only count week days (*7/5)
100 for housing
25 for food
10 for travel
5 for shopping
5 for entertainment
4 for bills
3 for health

We need self-extraction
In my opinion we also need information

Is man allowed from the beast?
Through words, man is able to shrink information,
Instead of a picture that takes up a lot of space, a person can save the information as a word, which takes up very little space,
So a person has more information in his head, and that way he has more energy

A word can cause an atom bomb to explode (&quot;Fire!&quot;)
Is there a limit to the equivalence between information and energy?
Maybe a word only allows energy routing,
It does not exactly create energy, but it is able to release energy

Well this week I&#39;ll try to get to something that trades for me in day trading
The goal is to exceed 1.5% per month
By and large with syndicates I should be able to reach 20%
That it&#39;s already amazing…
I built on 10%
Most people trust 4%
But with 20% and a million dollars, we no longer have to work…
Then I start thinking about donation…
Set aside ten…
Although I set aside more than that in taxes…
Taxes it let’s say a third, out of that quarter it’s federal, and only two-tenths is state.
The state is primarily for education and health.
The federal is divided into medatorial (two-thirds) and discreet (one-third).
The discreet is half security and half other things like transportation and education
Mandatory is about a little less than half health (Medicare Medicaid) and a little less than half Social Security, the rest is other things.
So in addition to what goes into security, it&#39;s a kind of contribution.
Although I too will make a profit from it, but probably not at the level I give…
How can this be calculated?
This doctor is for the elderly
Medicaid is for the less able. So for sure I pay for them, something like a quarter (sixteenth) of the salary, which is 6%.
Okay, so let&#39;s say 4% contribution
Where should it go?
Do not know
I think what will save the most lives is autonomous cars
What will give the most years of life is to raise the mind to the cloud…
Elon Musk

Well what else?
I want to buy Shiran tickets for the minister for his birthday…
There is also this thing of friends
And there is also the trip to Yosemite…
Lots of happenings

What else?
We were at Maya&#39;s yesterday for her birthday, it was nice, but can not say I flew there on someone too much…
We&#39;ve been to Joey&#39;s too, but can not say I flew there too much for anyone…
Bummer,
It is not easy to find people in the exact same head…
What connected me, my father and Eyal, was our horniness.
People like Ziv I have not met too much…
Or Yaron…
Perhaps Itzik is the closest…

Maybe I should learn some debate…
maybe not…
It will take me so long as soon as I finish with the piece of money
Jesus, this is not an easy thing to do.
I will tell my children first of all to finish with the part of the money, to do some business and that&#39;s it, that they will do what they want.
I could have finished with it at age 30, if I hadn’t spent so much time on school.
Well my parents seem to fire at 65 (pretty awesome) so maybe I have some more time to do things.
What would I like to do?
Well I have no idea
I want to take a sabbatical,
This is my fifth year here. Next year is the sixth year, after which I would love to go on sabbatical.
With the help of the name then I will have 500 thousand, with the help of the name they will make 20% and then I will be a free person.

What else?
Do not know the truth…
Trying to think
Maybe make music?
I have all day
what am I doing?
Meet to talk to strangers…
What do I want to talk about?

It seems to me that I am depressed
My energy levels are low
Maybe I should do more exercise
Maybe
I dance about twice a week and make pickles
But nothing but that
Maybe it&#39;s because of that
Like my mother
But she is addicted to fitness
It is also unhealthy
so what are we doing?
Alcohol like my dad?
Cannabis?
Maybe I need a prescription from a doctor
Maybe weed really is the cure
Maybe I should just change places
I cheated today
Reward I fucked her
I feel pretty shit
But I had to do it
Finish with that
Do not know
I felt bound
imprisoned
But then the devil came to pick me up
Reward he had a DVD on a license plate
And that was after she did not want to cum
And the second did end
So I had to
She really wanted to
So what am I just going to turn on girls?
Well do not know
Maybe Ashley will save me…
Maybe
I wish
Two depressive
Oops
I do not know what to do
Maybe a baby will fill in the gaps for me
Maybe it&#39;s just too easy for me
ססעמק
Why talk like that?
Good
What else?
At work I did not finish what I needed
Because I was busy betraying
Oops
Maybe I need a religion
Maybe
I need a hobby
How about making music?
What about it?

Good
What more?
Do not know
What else?
Have the festival tomorrow
I seem to be a little pissed off that I did not help
But what can I do
I also did not want Sheeran to be fucked
The truth is I&#39;m pretty tired of it
Do not know
Do not know if I get along with her well
Do not know if I get along well with people
I have no power
And it requires a lot of energy
Maybe that&#39;s the problem
so what are we doing?
Maybe I need a rabbi and a psychologist
Do not know
Good
What more
What else what else
Enough already
Good
Want to talk about something?
No
I have no power over anything
Good
Want to talk to some girl?
Neh
They do not really want to talk to me
Who do you want to talk to?
With Go Rogen
Walla

So I will finish the deep learning courses, I have finished the real estate courses
What now?
I need to find a good investment in real estate
I should continue working on the project as soon as I have more knowledge in rnn

What do you do in real estate?
Look at forums
Go to the metaphors
Maybe find a good book
Look at opportunities
analyze
perform
Hey
what&#39;s going on?
All is well
What about you?
Sabba
So what?
Nothing went wrong at work
It seems to me a question does not kick out of me and it only increases the stress and decreases my desire to work
I need to finish the project, and work on the lexicon and normalization and lemmatization
It&#39;s full of work, and I did not do much this week
We&#39;ll try to get to that
What else?
Hopefully he will go smoothly with the house
Need to paint it it can be several thousand
But what can be done
Besides the financial agreement
I need to fill it out already
And send to some to get a quote
what else
I&#39;m dying for a threesome
I can at $ 240 get it
With that Chinese
I do not feel good with betraying
But I also do not feel good about being imprisoned in a relationship
Maybe I need a psychologist
It seems to me that I need a man
Although maybe a woman will show me the other side better
I would be happy if she was my age
But maybe the fact that there is no sexual tension helps me to speak more freely
You can check which session
Good
What else?
Do not know
What else?

Well then Lisa has a new favorite
It really sucks
Even a little painful
Even very painful
do not know why
I really loved me
She is very pretty
And smart, looks good man
But a small chest
Do not know if it matters
It changed me in the past
With Chinita and Maayan
Both are really beautiful
But I have to breastfeed
Good
Maybe it&#39;s for the best
All for the better no?
Good
what can we do
Wait for the wound to pass
I wonder how long it will take
I was in a relationship with her for half a year in my opinion
It&#39;s quite a bit
I wonder if they will be in touch for another six months
I&#39;m really interested in how he does it
I&#39;m really interested in getting to know him
There is a situation where he looks better than me
There is a situation he just plays his cards better
Oops
Maybe I&#39;ll make a premium just so I can talk to him
I can do a week for free
Good
Good

Well this is the worst day I&#39;ve had in years
Google told me no
I think it&#39;s even worse than Lisa
But by and large it&#39;s in the same area
There is no other company I would move to it seems to me
Maybe Naorlink
As if it&#39;s not bad if I&#39;m currently in my third choice
Although the specific team is not who knows anything
On the site Is there anyone I would invest in like Lisa?
Do not know
Christiana is also really beautiful
But I do not have this connection with her
Do not know anything in it feels real
Do not know
In the meantime, I have never met anyone like that
But if I do not find someone else maybe it means something good about Sheeran
Maybe this is actually a good thing?
Maybe
Good
It&#39;s nice to look at it that way
okay, well
See if there are any openings for Naorlink I guess
So who would I go to if not for Lisa?
There was this rebellion that really flew over me
who else?
Imi G.
Maggie maybe
Oops
we will see what will be
The ones I really want are not so named after me, but maybe it does not matter, maybe I should just enjoy watching them cum
Maybe
Good
All for the best
It&#39;s really a question of whether I still think that way after these two evils
But it is true it is difficult to know at that moment whether something is for the better or not
The only physical explanation I have that everything for the better is not really an explanation but a theory
Because the second law of Thermo states that everything is for the worse, as if the rush is only rising in the system in equilibrium
But there is a situation where the opposite is also true, when the system is not in equilibrium, and there is an input of energy, then everything is for the better, that is, things work out
Is it possible to find a counter-example?
Let&#39;s look

Hi, how’s it going?
Pretty good.
I had some good progress at work
Also excited about coming home and playing my favorite song on my guitar.
Also about working on the real estate research.
All I need is to add the expected rent to the mix to figure out the best location.
I also want to know if it’s landlord friendly.
I’m hoping to have over 10% returns.
There’s also neals offer, but I’m not sure I’ll get it.
I’m not officially accredited.
I can try to be with the free service. 
Either way I’m not in a rush.
The market might fall but hopefully not this year or beginning of next.
What else? Shiran is still stuck, still a bit annoying.
I have a bit of a sore throat.
Hope it’s nothing. I’ll wait a week hopefully it will pass.
What else?
I’m doing this tf course. Hope to apply it to my stock data.
If that works I don’t need real estate. I’d be so happy.
What else?
I’m thinking of taking a working from home day every month, to sit and work from the city (not actually from home because Shiran is there).
I’m also thinking of going to do some massage while there. Hopefully a full body, sensual massage. 
There are many options and I’m pretty sure I’ll get something good.
What else?
I don’t know…
What about happiness?
Are we giving this up?
I mean I think I’m good.
I’m not sure what happiness is.
I guess there are 2 types of happiness. One is the momentary happiness, like eating pizza, or orgasm, or drugs, which I guess is addictive (if you fill it you stay hungry, if you hunger it you stay full). And the other one is the continuous, being in the moment type happiness. Which I guess is awesome.
But I don’t think happiness is the most important thing. Sometimes we want to watch a sad movie, listen to a sad song, eat something bitter. We need all the colors of the rainbow.
What else?
Ummm…
Why worship.
Till now the best explanation comes from Sella.
Being in the moment as a way of life improves happiness.
How does that work with energy?
Well energy is there always. Energy is to time the same as momentum is to location. I don’t know eme hay that means exactly.
There’s time space and there’s frequency space. Being in singularity in time space, being now, let’s you be in all of frequencies space.
That’s interesting, I wish I could make it more scientific.

I need something for the soul

What do you want to do?

Drugs?
Hoes?

What about some contribution to society?

What about that?
I am contributing to society…

OK

Dafuq am I doing with my life

I can do anything!
What do I do?

Create a machine I can upload my brain to

Neuralink style, I guess…



A service that saves all api calls, for writing, and executes them as soon as there is a network
This is how you can implement GitLab&#39;s api offline as well


Dear God I wanted you to know I know where you are, really it&#39;s interesting why I ask myself this all the time, it&#39;s a bit puzzling, this blind writing is nice to Allah but it&#39;s hard for me to believe that after that I&#39;m going to be a strictly blind writer, my dilemma is whether writing Somehow for thought I do not write as fast as I think, the speech was really a spin but I have a feeling that it is not as practical as the writing, the writing can be edited immediately and the speech can not, I can also just think for an hour, but also it is not so practical Because then I fall asleep, and what if I just walk down the street and think, I have too many stimuli, so I have to go where there are no people, but where there are no people, I live in the city, like in the book Zen the boy goes where he wants, that&#39;s how I want And I think about it because I think about my parents telling me it&#39;s dangerous to walk alone, not like the kid in the story, who barely had a paternal touch, and in the end he was murdered in a robbery, is it just, I do not know but I have a feeling he was hurt in the stomach, right where he is Always felt the psychosomatic pains, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a connection between length or lifestyle and how much you love, when you love you are happy when you radiate joy then love you , Like this girl from boxing, she&#39;s really cute, hurt by everything, she has a funny R. but she&#39;s really cute, and she&#39;s also a girl who looks around and notices me, because I have about a thousand and one men for three girls in the semester who are also worth something, so It&#39;s not a fair attitude I do not mean to fight, it seems to me especially unnecessary in the situation that every time I go out, I have a phone without starting with anyone, even though I really want to get who I want and not always who wants me, and that&#39;s the problem but more The dilemma I have is the fact that I think that if I try too hard ie go to this course (and pay 2000 NIS at least) I do not know if it pays off because in the end what they say it will be yourself, just totally mean do not be afraid of what she wants and try to be what That she expects but be you, do not change for her, be the man the leader so called, I have a lot of appreciation for leaders, it is the idea leader as it was written in my sister&#39;s book they do not need anyone to be next to them and that is why everyone wants to be next to them, it is such a thing Like they said to create attraction is to juggle between good and evil, between wanting and not wanting, I just think that if you are good to everyone, but not personally, then everyone will be good to you, because they are not Will think you&#39;re doing it for something, on the other hand there are all those who are anti and also they attract people, precisely because they are anti, maybe it&#39;s people with low self esteem, like Little and her girlfriend, but I do not want such negative people around anyway, How do I learn, it&#39;s a beautiful question, I thought it was all concepts because basically everything is questions but really I feel I have to go down with it in depth, I feel that the lowest or more correct most basic question is what I want, and I do not know what I want, And because of this I try to formulate basic assumptions such as causality which I can not completely agree on, (for example because it negates my ability to choose), but it shows a lot of logic, as well as statistics, it can also show a lot but is not binding, and all the more Kind of assumptions, so I went in the direction of evolution to try to figure out where the concept of desire comes from, or what the difference is between us living only acting on impulse instincts, even though I can&#39;t be sure of that either, and I end up concluding that I can not be sure of anything, so Just enjoying what I do, is the answer, but I want to do only what I want to do, and studying at the Technion I&#39;m not sure This is true, because culture directs me, and perhaps culture was created from the moment this creature called man had free time to think not only about what he must to survive, I mean his thought was not only gene-oriented, but also order-oriented perhaps, and he tried to conceive The world, to call everything in terms, so that his inner world will be the whole outer world so he can predict it better, has it succeeded so far we are progressing in the matter rather, we can predict the weather very nicely, and with that we have developed technology thanks to it for example we know Combustion brings energy that can be used to spin wheels that can be used to transport, and we can also turn a flow of electrons into information like this on a computer, and we also know how to route it into space and back to Earth to create communication and even more ... Internet, so good for us. The information to reality, and use it but why, so that we have more money, yes I feel I want money but why, so that I have a bigger house? Why? To have girls? So that I have a family so that my children will not miss anything to name it? Oh good question, I really like to solve questions or maybe ask them, like the historical dialectic driven by questions, how from the genes did we get to the questions, and if the gene is selfish, then why? I do not know what I wanted to ask, but there is some thesis about the selfish gene that I I did not quite understand, and the question is when did the gene stop controlling our lives, and why,? I understand the recursion in what survives is what is planned to survive or rather survives is who is the best in surviving, so why the gene and he is the only one who does it, how in the world Reached his developed level to replicate, fire also replicates so what&#39;s the point, what&#39;s special about the gardens? How did they not have competition, I usually notice that there is not much competition everyone does what suits him and in that he is the best, even though there is competition within the sex , I mean you&#39;re getting better because you&#39;re competing with yourself, and not with anyone else, understand? So the instinct still remains in us, the question is what do I do with everything I have written now, what is the idea in ordering it, what does it help me to order, why do I strive to order, do I strive to order or predict the future, or why? For harmony, what is it anyway? Was nice with the blind writing, but did you notice Jordan how did you not talk about sex most of this writing? Is not that what controls our lives, culture? I understand the theory of the selfish gene, only that in humans it feels a little less relevant, even though the leader, there is this aspiration that your influence will remain forever, your seal, but it seems to me it stems from how we attribute a positive emotion towards all those remembered, and even The ones I remember badly, inside face we appreciate, like Hitler my grandfather passed away, it&#39;s weird, I knew and saw that he would not last long but I also noticed that every time we were the whole family with him and he got a lot of love he suddenly felt better, right that too Related to drugs but is like I came to get him out of the bathroom, so after a night we were all with him and held him, that&#39;s how he felt better, that&#39;s how much love you get that&#39;s how you get stronger, I&#39;m from dad I did not get a lot of love, that&#39;s how I feel at least, It seems to me that a lot of negative people it&#39;s simply because they did not get much love, I do not really know how it goes but it&#39;s interesting, do what you most enjoy doing, so apart from fucking I also like to think, but I&#39;m just important to find what I want Or most like to do, when in fact this is what I do most of the time trying to answer, trying to look for answers, or connections also connections it from And an important mistake, it connects me to relationships, relationships between concepts, it&#39;s the contexts I&#39;m talking about, it connects me to language, how its structure starts from the verb and the noun and the relation and the name, or the concept, for example tree, the relation of the tree itself seems to come much later, I want to think how to study effectively, but why because I&#39;m at the Technion yes so what, why do I need something from the Technion why do I need the Technion, I just flow after what my friends did, enjoy you like to think, it&#39;s just that, it&#39;s to think, and a lot , So do it you have questions, you have problems, try to think about them, but then I do exactly what culture expects of me, you want to influence culture, that&#39;s what you do, through your thinking, what question do you want to answer? It does not matter, the Technion gives you tools, such as language, without language, how you would think, try to think without language, as in gibberish meditation, try to control your thought, can you really do it, what you think about when you think Except for food and sex, but masturbating is not the same as with a girl, oh I would like someone who&#39;s just flowing, someone to just fuck her whenever I want, because that&#39;s what&#39;s called fun, but they think about marriage, not like that, I&#39;m sure Not all of them, but they do not get tired after doing it once with a certain man, but why not, years of evolution have done their thing, all their eggs are bigger, but what a huge difference has happened, ha, and now there is evolutionary stability, it Nice this topic, they take theory, and what catches, stays, not like that, most of the time it will be a mistake but in the meantime it allows development, so take a basic hypothesis and test it, and if it is not correct, then proceed from it, but do not have this possibility or privilege to speculate Something and find out in the evening that it is not true, but what is true, there is no right is wrong, there is more or less true for example it is hard for me to imagine that someone could have predicted Einstein&#39;s theory before Newton, nothing And besides the concepts you define, although at the moment language is quite defined for me, then what concepts can I build die theories like for example mathematics, how do I know what I like? Question, then assume you like something, and if you do not you will already feel it,

I need to buy a house
All you have to do is see 100 houses
Bid on 10
Close with 1
big time

When I do 20 apartments in two hours, the total effort should not take more than ~ 10 hours
I think save it with api
But I do not know if it is really that critical
The main problem is that the rent costs a dollar to read
And I can test it alone in a rentometer, it takes a minute
The truth is that if I really think about it it&#39;s about 5-10 minutes of work per transaction
That is 6-12 trades per hour

How much is my minute worth?
I make 150,000 a year, (do not know whether to count the bonus or not)
12500 per month
625 per day
62.5 at
But about a third goes to taxes
It&#39;s 41 let&#39;s an hour
Is an hour out of work worth it like that?
I guess my work hour should be ~ $ 40 net…
It&#39;s not that much if you think about it…
It&#39;s also because I work ten hours, which is quite true I leave at eight and come back at seven, which is 11 hours including everything, but on the way back I do not exactly work…
That means 0.66 cents per minute

If something saves me ~ 5-10 hours it is worth $ 200-400
The question of whether it really is such a saver
Because I pay a dollar for a house, that means $ 100 in total
And that&#39;s without the other variables I need
That&#39;s another half dollar


If I can not make a hierarchy of tasks in Gitleb
I can run a project from any task that falls apart
But even there there is no hierarchy
I can use tags
But even there there is no hierarchy
I can reference any task to her children and vice versa
I can add the feature to Gitlab but I do not really know Ruby

Another problem is that it does not run offline
By and large this should not be too much of a problem
But come to think of it, this happens too often
I can create an application that implements the Gitlab API and in addition it has internal memory to enable offline operations
But I do not really know Swift
This week I have to finish signing the contract and transferring the money
Finish with that

What&#39;s going on?
Not too much
Just wasting time at work
it&#39;s not good
But what to do
I&#39;m waiting for help from people
Can I move forward somehow?
Do not know
I read things as if I had cleaned up the mail big time
There are probably more things to do
I have a little strength…

If I continue like this, I can retire in another 7-8 years
8 years is ~ 100 months ~ 400 weeks ~ 2000 working days ~ 20000 working hours

I can start a table of despair, but it seems discouraging to me

Mantesumo

Mantesuma!


good so
I need to find an investment
For that I need to analyze something like 100 trades
I narrowed down the options to Florida and California
These are two places I would love to visit / live in
Florida has the advantage of having more opportunities
I live in California, so I can literally walk around and visit here

I can write some tool that will analyze all the transactions that the guy from Florida sent me
I can update it to check deals in California

I should also add information on schools and crime

Well then I have an apartment that looks rotten on paper
I might make an offer for her
What other steps are there on the way
I will post in the forum about the deal
I should maybe do some tests in California at the same time

I need to understand a little more about the process of funding
I&#39;m a little upset that I brought them the social before I found out

So what do you say?
Not too much
We walked a bit this week
it was really nice
We saw full of landscapes!
We drove full
We were a bit of a bogas
We were also in the fancy section, from the credit card
Dude, we met Dekel
Sheeran seems to be in a tension with her boyfriend
There is a situation she wants me :)
Well what else?
Not too much
I looked at real estate opportunities
The majority do not look too crazy
I need to look at how much dividend is guaranteed versus how much it costs
That&#39;s all there is to it
in anything
It&#39;s price versus value
For them, the consideration is the final price, how much it will sell
Plus how much dividend you get at any given moment
But in the end the final price is supposed to embody the profit
So it comes down to cost versus final dividend or selling price
I can analyze companies like this in a nutshell
Then what&#39;s the difference actually…
I can try all the options and see what works…

I can start looking at opportunities for startups
Then maybe if he comes to make one myself
The problem is that startups often fail
So do not know if I want to put 50 thousand on something that probably will not work
The question is how good am I at knowing what will work
It&#39;s an option
I can do a simulation and see how much I would earn
interesting
Train myself to predict what will succeed
It would have been better to train a neural network…
But even doing it myself I was happy

It&#39;s an option
I would have been happy to finish earlier with real estate syndicates

what else?
How&#39;s life?
Walla there are not many complaints in total
Boring
maybe a little
What to do?
hobby
What hobby?
what do you want?
Do not know…
I was happy to know how to build websites it seems to me
Build things in code
I might have written from Jupiter&#39;s companies
Then publish them somewhere

like what?
Suppose faceswap as a service?
Suppose…
How do you do that?
Impossible with notebook
It is possible with what was recommended in fastai
By and large do not know if you need too much
Need to upload video and photo
And get video
This
By and large this is the interface of any web page
What give
What do you get
What is the signature of the page
Good
I get a little tangled up with the time to wait
Like how does it work?
I&#39;m sending a movie and a picture
The server is producing a movie
The server uploads the movie as output
Can also give a link to YouTube

Good
What else?
Not too much
Tomorrow is the last day off
Sunday
Then I have two weeks and then I fly…

So how does real estate work
What makes it such a good tool for money?

Some put aside to reach a million
100000=s(x+x^2+...+x^n)=s*(x^(n+1)-x)/(1-x)
log(10^6)=log(x^(n+1)-x)-log(1-x)

1000=(x^n-1)/(x-1)
8=x^n
log (8) = nlog (1.008)

83 = (x ^ nx) / (x-1)
8.3=x^n
ln (8) * 10 = n
2*10=n

So it takes twenty years and a thousand dollars a month…
It&#39;s not so bad
It&#39;s even a spin
And that&#39;s if he manages to make 10%
If he manages to make 20%, it&#39;s only ten years



What to do?

So what do you think?
Not too much
What do I already have to think
I want a throne
To buy freedom
I need NIS 3 million
This means an order of magnitude of 1000-2000 shekels 1000-2000 times
This means that if a day I get 1000-2000 shekels I need 1000-2000 such, which is between 3-6 years, or if not calculated Friday and Saturday, then 5-10 years
Or I will just get 10,000 a month forever which means 300 shekels a day, or 500 shekels a day not including Saturday
how do I do it?
All in all, it will be enough for me to have an apartment that I rent, I need NIS 10,000 from the apartment, a two-room apartment in Dizengoff is worth about NIS 5,000 a month, and is worth about NIS 2 million, that means you need 2 for 10,000 a month, that means you need 4 million for it
So how do you get NIS 4 million?
10000 a month is 120 thousand a year, it&#39;s about 3 percent a year, it&#39;s not that much, only inflation 3 percent, but it&#39;s related to inflation, so basically it&#39;s 3 above inflation
There are better investments

I would like to develop an app, how much money is a user worth?
Facebook Yahoo and Likdain make about $ 1-2 per user per year, Google makes $ 10 per year
According to an estimate of a dollar per user, I need 120,000 shekels a year, which is 30,000 dollars, that means 30,000 users,
By an estimate of 10 cents I need 300 thousand

What do I want to do?
I want to play civilization
I want to build the game
What in total is in it
There is a board, which consists of squares, there are people and there are products that people can produce
Each slot has properties
Everyone has characteristics
Every product has characteristics
The properties can be listed on the fly
The properties should amount to
transportation
health
Education
culture
security
Sentence
Of money
Welfare
    
Suppose a community of chimpanzees
Any chimpanzee can:
move
eat
Fight
Produce
reproduce
Discard lice

Any organism can:
Perform metabolism (eat)
reproduce

Animals can also move





If God is the place
Does that mean time is the devil?
If I were allowed to choose between joy or wisdom, I feel I would choose wisdom
On the face of it this contradicts nihilism, or the maximization of happiness
So why would I do that?
It&#39;s like this need to touch a wound in the mouth
why is it?
Is this a mistake?
Is it software in me by the environment / genetics?

Wow
Ashley
She&#39;s so beautiful
And speaks to the matter
I really do not know what to do
She saw my ring
She pretty much realized I&#39;m married
And we talked about it
And she hired said she could not marry me until I got divorced
So there is a situation that is really in my interest
But what do I do?
Sheeran is cute and everything
But she&#39;s amazing
Good early to know
We&#39;ll keep talking
There is a pretty big language barrier anyway
I think it can be overcome
I also do not really know if it&#39;s flirting (I believe not)
If I could meet her maybe I could know
Well I guess I have nothing to think about it now

The question is when?
When I have children?
But what do I do?
Do not know
Will we flow?

What&#39;s wrong with Lizrom?
This is the difference between intelligent design and evolution
I can make plans, but in the end evolution just wins
As in religion, as in economics
But flowing means I trust my emotion
And my feeling is not always right
Which is better, to decide with emotion or with logic?
Life is not math
What about work? I go with the logic in investing and working
Retiring early does not flow, it requires planning
I do not know
So flow here too?

m1v1^2+m2v2^2=m1v1’^2+m2v2’^2

I don't know
I do not know what to do
there&#39;s nothing
What do I enjoy doing?
I have no idea
I do not want anything
I want to be free
But that will probably only happen in about another 15 years

I want to fuck full of women…
Do full of drugs…

What did I do during the weekend?
I checked the account
I worked a bit on the project
I went for a walk
I saw two documentaries
I took a bath
I slept until 11
Facebook
Imgor
I saw episodes of The House of Cards

I want to find a cafe where I can work
I want a weekend to work one day and do nothing one day
I prefer not to do anything on Saturday
There are some issues with this
On Saturday here everything is open, Sunday closed
On Saturday I am preoccupied with a lot of things I need to do
I would like to sit in a cafe, but talking to everyone on Skype from a cafe would feel weird

So what do I do?
what are the options?
Work on computational learning
In the field of money
In the field of language
Work with the census

What do I want to do?
If I did not have to do anything, what would I do?
Do not know

What interests me about the census?
I would like to do a simulation of the world through the statistics
Maybe try to predict the future that way
Maybe turn it into a game
Maybe try to figure out what actions are worth doing


The idea is machine learning for Chip Design
What are the steps?
What&#39;s best in academia
realize
If I have an idea how to improve then do it
If there is such a company
Join her, if she is not looking at the market to raise her mind to the cloud, then open one
Good
So what are the steps?
To see if it exists


In a hardware company, it is difficult to make software
And vice versa it seems to me
Good
Fancy chocolate?
Do not know
Do you want something?
what?
Maybe chocolate
Maybe coffee
Maybe coffee and cookies
Maybe
So we&#39;ll go to the nearest market to get cookies
Good

If every 12 weeks I deserve a week
So every 50 months I deserve a month no?
About
About every 4 years
Yes it makes sense
Good
What else?
Everything is fine
What about you?
Sabba
How was today
OK
Lots of masturbation
Why is it so complicated
Do not know
What to do?
Do not know
Good
what is the plan?
Right now, get ready for an interview
And that&#39;s it
Meanwhile
Good
Hope to get some month off
If I do not receive, I will try to take at the end of the year
ֿ


Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
What about you?
OK
I&#39;m really depressed that Ashley gave up on me
I really wanted her
Will be fine
But could have been amazing
Good
What else?
Do not know
What else?
At work fine
I talked to the principal about projects
I hope the matizationization project will be interesting
But it&#39;s hard to know
Also hope that normalization will be interesting
Good
What else?
Do not know
I&#39;m mostly in Bassa because of Ashley
Yesterday was poker, maybe I should have gone
okay, well
What else?
Joe Rogen was interesting with Alex Jones
Jones says there is no global warming, which I do not hear is true
But there were interesting things he said, like about this company Grove Something, that all the presidents meet there
But do not know how much it really affects the world
What else did he say?
Do not remember, probably not that critical
Do not see anything important in the searches
okay, well
An interesting man
He&#39;s sure tech&#39;s coming to destroy the world… I think he&#39;s wrong
What more?
Trump is apparently losing
I think this is not something for Israel
The reference is perhaps to sovereignty in Judea and Samaria
Although the plan exists
But the chances of it happening in a democratic administration are low
Bummer
Why?
Because Jews deserve to live in Judea
We arrived in the Promised Land but only near
We are like Moses
Good
What else?
The project did not progress today
What more?
Lawyer, I need to go back to the guy who wanted 2500
What more?
Do not know
What more…
There is not too much
Yesterday was poker
I tapped
I did not want to come up with allergies
But that&#39;s nonsense
My brain is not flexible
I went back to the anal type (T) I was
It&#39;s a basa
what can we do?
Do not know
Smoke more weed?

Were the Nazis bad people?
I do not think so
No more than any man who fights
We glorify the Jews who eliminated those living in Israel in the occupation of the land
Or the Americans who fought for their independence or the Israelis
Or the war on terror
But even here full of people are killed
The question is whether it is different to kill a civilian community than to kill soldiers
You could say killing is always bad
But it&#39;s not practical
You reduce the chance of winning if you set boundaries for yourself
In war there are no rules, in victorious tricks
So suppose it is better not to kill if not necessary
But what if need be
Is a soldier&#39;s life worth less than a civilian&#39;s life
There is a situation
But some less
Would you kill 10 soldiers to save a civilian?
Especially with us, soldiers did not choose it
But suppose I chose it
Am I worth a tenth of a citizen?
Do not think
The Nazis fought the Jews with the thought that they posed an existential threat
That does not mean they are bad people
If I had been born in Germany as a non-Jewish German, chances are I would also have become a Nazi
Good
What else?
Do not know
I have no power over anything
I need to send this girl money and invoices for cleaning and moisturizing diffuser
Good
I have no power
I do not know why I have no power for anything
Is it really work from home?
Why is it so awful?
Do not know
so what are we doing?
Do not know
Maybe I need a psychologist
Maybe a little more to move
Maybe bullets
Maybe Wade
As if it&#39;s just existential anxiety
I want to get away from this nothing
Why is it so awful?
Why is it impossible to live in this nothing?
Do not know

What to do
What do I do with my life
Come on let&#39;s release the video
Or maybe we&#39;ll pay ~ $ 40 for a Faber video
Or I&#39;ll make something myself

I was really happy to be able to make videos
But it requires a lot of energy
I can make a presentation easily
I can also add animation
But how do I add characters
If it were possible to add gifs as you could add a clipart
It is possible, but it is not simple

The options seem to be:
15. photoshop    34 (0.5%)
11. after effects    23 (0.4%)
32. powerpoint    17 (0.3%)
42. sketchup    13 (0.2%)
52. powtoon    9 (0.1%)
57. maya    9 (0.1%)
69. iclone    8 (0.1%)
72. videoscribe    7 (0.1%)
81. cs6    7 (0.1%)
96. blender    6 (0.1%)
98. premiere    6 (0.1%)
177. adobe flash    4 (0.1%)
160. inventor    4 (0.1%)
163. roblox    4 (0.1%)
173. unity    4 (0.1%)



Photoshop / After Effects / Premier / cs6 / Flash costs something like $ 50 a month and it requires some work
Poutons cost a minimum of $ 80 - but you can get a free version with their logo
I have PowerPoint for free - but it requires a little more work
Video writing is like the Poutons but maybe cheaper but with fewer options
This sketchup / inventor is for 3D modeling
Maya / Aiklon / Blender / Roblux / Unity is three-dimensional



Shut up
I need some vipassana time 
No talking, no people , no input, no output, just idle processing time…
I’d rent a car and live in the car.
How do I get food?
Order in the app
Or I can go in mcdonalds, order through the machine, and take out
But then do I have the cellphone open?
No, just to order…

I then drive to Tijouana

When is that happening?
Could have happened in Memorial day…
Probably I’ll have to wait…
July 4th?
Probably a lot of work…

Can I have AL + JNI + transliteration done by then?
How far is it? 2 months…
That’s not a lot…
Goal - have JNI in production. AL in production. Transliteration in production.
We need to have some performance testing in place.



Now what?

What to do?
Nothing… Just waste the rest of your life…
I that it?
Damn.

I want more…
But what?
Money?
Experiences?
Like what?
I can’t do anything like south america again. I’m pretty old for that.
I can’t have all that sex and love games.
That’s pretty sad…

So what can I do?
Hookers and drugs…



Tell me something
What’s interesting to me
What would I like to know
Nothing is important
What can I do for the rest of my life?
How does the best day of my life look like?
Cocaine and hookers?
Weed and video games?
Mushrooms and meditation?
Coffee and jerusalem post?

What bothers me the most?
Work?

In 4 years I should be free
4 years is a lot, but it’s not that bad…

What’s a perfect day for me?
Just relax and do nothing?
Explore the outdoors with someone I love?
Solve a problem for humanity?
Create an AI?

I want to get my life in order

Right now everything is here
But from here I can not start writing code
But when writing a problematic code to write in Hebrew
It is also inconvenient for tasks
I do not really know what I want


I want a million dollars
For that I have to do 0.6 percent annually, and save it the amount I spend
Then I will accumulate a million in 12 years

Maybe my life is too easy
Maybe because I have no effort I&#39;m degenerating
Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m depressed
so what to do?
Make an effort?
By and large a child is probably an effort
It is likely
It&#39;s probably some 13 years of effort
Although according to
This is a full two hours a day for a small child (up to 6) and an hour for a child older than that

Well what else?
Not too much
mere
Bored
I need a hobby maybe
Maybe draw
Maybe I need the pencil for the iPad

Was quite interesting the lecture on the disintegration of Brahma
It&#39;s probably told from a western angle
But still it&#39;s nice to hear history
Connect things
Don&#39;t know if I learned much
But it was interesting
I also loved the movie we saw
Glass
This piece of true love, really kitschy, but really moved me
Maybe I have something to do with it now
I really feel like I can love Ashley, really

Good
What else?
is nothing
Just passing on life
I&#39;m thinking of my next day off
Talk to this Chloe, see if she&#39;s a turnaround I&#39;ll get her by hand
Or with Noro Massager, or Mutual Massager

Well what else
The truth is it did not seem to be flying at me
Maybe it&#39;s a piece of language that is not shown to men who are attracted to them
It seems to me that in South America or Russia it is more free
Do not know
Or is it just that I look better on screen
Anyway
I had more fun with the ugly one who let me bring her by the hand and said I was beautiful
Than with the beautiful one that just came down to me

Good
what else?
is nothing
Other than that there is nothing
I still have no power for anything
Do not know what I have
Maybe depression
Do not know
So what will I do for treatment?
I do not know if I want treatment
I do not trust them enough
I prefer to go to the Rebbe
Although even to the Rebbe I do not know if I want to go
As if my situation does not suit him
What will I tell him that I watch porn all the time?
That I&#39;m in love with a girl from the internet?
And to a psychologist?
Do not know
As if I trust he will not tell
The truth is that I suppose a rabbi will not tell either
But I do not trust that he knows what he is doing
If already behind a rabbi there are thousands of years of experience of other rabbis
That&#39;s why I think maybe the girls on the sex site live, maybe they can listen to me
As Ashley listens to me

Well what else?
Nothing bro
there&#39;s nothing
so what are we doing?
Nothing bro
I have a little more day off
I&#39;m planning to go to either Claire or someone else
Every month someone
That&#39;s about $ 300 a month
And the site is about 200
And if I want twice a month, it&#39;s already coming out full
$ 500, for both
Which is 6000 a year
Which is double 12 to keep the 8%
This sum should be 7%, then double 14
6*14=84
So another 84000
It&#39;s not that much of a truth
This is another year of work
To go once a month to someone
And masturbate with girls online
Maybe I can even go up twice
Suppose 8000 times 14 is 112000
I do not know if I can do it
The truth is I hang out with once a month
Good
What else?
I need someone for the surfers
If Ashley is not there for me I need someone else
But it&#39;s not easy to find

The relationship between s&p500 or vti to gdp
It bothers me that Sheeran is negative and that she is yelling at me

Now we were going to meet Matty
She did not want to take a bus and really did not want to take two buses
It bothers me more not to meet people at all
The mental injury here bothers me more
And whatever I suggested was done she said no
And it&#39;s hard for me
She&#39;s really scared of the corona
And I&#39;m not that scared
I obey instructions
For me to meet other people is necessary for my mental sanity

If I go back to breathing, I&#39;ll probably end up thinking about money

There is also a chance that I will come to the thought of writing

But a lot more thoughts about money
I need 10,000 shekels a month
Which is like about 16 shekels clean per hour
Anything above can go towards retirement
In total, I need to accumulate about 0.5 - 1 million dollars

Why not do it the way I like for example in academia?
As long as I like it there is no reason not to

Actually there&#39;s no reason why I would rather be released early,
Where to release early? High tech! Not by day, by year
Every day going out late, it&#39;s a hard frame, but half the time,
Because I can have fun earning 20 a month and then set aside
And retire at 45
But then I completely erase those years
In academia at least I have more interest, it&#39;s probably more appropriate to what I would do if I were free

Why register?

I need to build a market prediction machine based on the text of an article
If it works, I&#39;m done I have an investment machine



Why am I down?
For no reason
The truth is that I&#39;m really nice here
With all the individuals

A section in the cafe each with its own
And in the pub all together
Although there are also those on the well

What fun I have having a cell phone to write on
Google&#39;s mother cup
Although I could have done it without them

I need to concentrate my money
That will begin to grow
Despite aspiration I can invest some money safely
Bond does not really give anything it seems

I want to go for a massage
But for that I need an account
There is only one place in the area that can be walked to
Maybe it would have been better to stay in San Francisco
There are many more options there
The bass is that Monday is a basketball I do not want to lose
Also has the seating of the group
Priorities Ha…

The only girl in the area is not working today…
Absolutely better to stay in the city…
so what are we doing?
I can come back early
But then what about basketball?
Yes, it&#39;s a basa
I can give up basketball today

Why not buy an apartment here for 50k
Instead of renting 3k?
I pay a mortgage, 4%, from 200k, it comes out something like 1k a month
I save 2k like this, or 24k a year which is a 50% return,
How can it be?
Basically 50k at 12% return, supposed to bring in 500 a month, lowering my costs from 3000 to 2500
A 250k apartment rented for 3k is a great investment. It&#39;s over 1%
Up to 300k it makes sense to invest here

Okay, if it&#39;s 500k, I put 100k, pay 4%, it&#39;s 2k a month, saves 1k a month, 12k a year, great investment.
So even at 500 it&#39;s worth it to look
Simulation of culture
options:
Take the OECD statistics as the handles that can be pulled and see what happens
More strategic direction - to smelt units that fight, or build, or do anything else
This can be brought from the direction of types of employment
Although there was no information from the field of the army



I want to get to work retired tomorrow
Striving not to think too much today
Maybe do exercise
It would have been best to run with music perhaps
But today is almost over
Where will I run at night?
It&#39;s not really over, there&#39;s until after 8
But I have to go to the destination and he will bring me

So how do I get retired tomorrow?
I want to finish with the need to work
But it&#39;s only another five years
And that&#39;s only if the corona does not do some serious damage here

So what do we do in the meantime?
I need to take some week off once in a while
Maybe in August
I have enough days off to do some two weeks off a year
So what do the rest of the time do?
I can work on this text-to-video project
Do not know if it competes with Apple
If so maybe do it as part of Apple

Well how does that help?
It could be a million dollar idea if it gets enough traffic
And if not, it&#39;s something to do
And that&#39;s okay

And what about work?
Everything is fine
We&#39;ll see what the plan is for the next quarter
See if Peter and these will allow me to work what I wanted
I also have the project of the intern
Do not so much know what the hazelnut
See you tomorrow

Music
How do I do?
What are the options?
Drop:
Learn how to produce music
Simply produce sequences of music in different sounds and connect them


I thought of changing from &quot;Always be nice&quot;
Do not be evil
Because why should I be nice?
But this very thought symbolizes that without it &quot;I would be evil&quot;
So maybe it&#39;s better to give up on such a motto at all
Hey whats up?
Everything is fine
Tomorrow the freedom is over
I need to go through the emails
Maybe swap places with Sheeran
Maybe send Ashley the links
What more?
It is much
I also did not really finish the Litcode exercise
The program for the week?
There are enough things
Don&#39;t really need a plan
Need to take care of at home
Need to finish with the lawyer
And there is another complete todo list
Good
Thing thing
Miles
What&#39;s in the emails?
Mostly job offers
I have to say that as long as there is a corona I prefer not to go through
Except for Google
Maybe for trading
Although it&#39;s not really either
The problem is that there is still quite a lot to trade
Good
I can reject them too
Yes
I do not really want trading
Good
Besides, there are emails from the mail
There are courses
Has the youtube api
Weekly Torah Portion
Startup School
Self-measurement of computational learning

That&#39;s about it
Two three from each amounts to some 20
Good
What else?

It&#39;s mostly the house stabbing me it seems to me
What to do?
Maybe I should just invest in a management company
Although a management company will also involve me
For example if a paint job needs to be done
Or what happens to the tenants
Stuff like that
Semc
Maybe just sell it
I need to see how much I make from the mortgage
Good
What else?
Or do i need cpa
How do I find cpa?
Maybe I need one in the app
Maybe
By and large it sounds like the app I make taxes through

What more?
Do not know
What is?
Miles
Reminders
Asana
Reading List



Hey whats up?
Sabba
What about you?
OK
So what do you say?
Tomorrow I&#39;m supposed to meet that one
I wonder how it will be
She says she does body to body
I wonder if face to face
And if she&#39;s done
If you can touch her
Good
we will see what will be
What else?
A little cold
it&#39;s windy
Good
Want to enter?
Soon
I&#39;m a little scared it&#39;s ruining my mood
Instead of building I force myself to do it
That it will not take me down from the songs
And from sitting on the roof
Good
I need some sun
Seems healthy to me
Good
What else?
At work Sabba
I did not deliver everything
But I did what I could
Not as productive as in the office
But much more than I was
Do not know whether to take freedom in Yom Kippur
I will try to take
Seems important to me
Well what else?
Interesting lectures I see
From what I understand the increase in incarceration is because of the drugs
They must do something about it here
This causes many more minorities to be in jail
It causes discrimination
It causes racism
To poverty
I would say that whatever you want to do you will do as long as you do not hurt anyone else
But then the question is what about the drug dealer
Is he hurting someone else?
Indirectly yes
But also the seller of cigarettes
And the seller of alcohol
Are they guilty?
How do you decide which drug is allowed and which is not?
In my opinion everything should be allowed
What is important is to clarify the danger
Once it is from an institution it is supervised
We need to see what is happening in Portugal
Good
What else?
This is Please Arf
Next week we should have a meeting with the counselor
we will see what will be
I wonder if Sheeran would like to lie down for the weekend
we will see what will be
We will flow
So what did we say about flow?
Advantages and Disadvantages?
There are things that are not enough data, they can not be solved with rules, you just have to learn from experience, and trust the emotion
Disadvantages:
There is no way to know what is right if there is no law, the emotion is influenced by a culture that is not necessarily right, I may be acting out of brainwashing.

But what is the option?
Think about the logical answer?
Is there a logical answer?
Outside of math there is no 100%, maybe we are in simulation
So the scientific method
Trial and error, model building, and so on and so forth once the observations are inappropriate
So what does the scientific approach say about sleeping with Sheeran?
Do I have enough observations about it?
I can weigh pros versus cons
but why?
Why does it matter?
If I have no preference anyway why decide in advance?
By and large I prefer not to have more fun with that one
But on the other hand maybe it&#39;s not good to come to it loaded
So what comes out I am greatly satisfied.

And what about the show when I meet her?
what&#39;s the point?
Maximize fun
I want to finish it
I want you to ride my bulbul
And how do you do that?
Face to face
But maybe my back will do it for her, and I&#39;ll be less horny in the meantime, maybe it&#39;s good
So all for the better
And what about touching her on matters?
Maybe she can finish herself faster?
we will see what will be
All for the best

Hey whats up?
Nothing
I still do not have the strength
Maybe it&#39;s a matter of sports
Maybe I should do more sports
Go for runs
Maybe I&#39;m going for a run now
We&#39;ll see how I feel, bro
I do not even know how to dress for a run here

Well I&#39;m waiting for the music to go down to the clock
Then I can run with the clock
I might also want to do a sim for the watch
Can be nice

Well what else?
Nothing but
I have no power
I have currents all over my body

What else?
Do not know
There is not too much
mere
I need hobbies
Maybe
So what will I do this week?
I think maybe I should not make music
Maybe I should draw
Maybe I should make games
Or 3D art

Oops
Maybe dance
I need to find another dance teacher
There&#39;s the girl I love from Debit
She also has dance classes

Well what else?
There is no outside
There is not too much
Tomorrow work again
I have no problem with it
It&#39;s not terrible for me to work
I would have preferred not to, but really not terrible
I would have preferred to do more research
Maybe if I really succeed in the project of text normalization, maybe it&#39;s worth me getting into it
Perhaps it is possible to publish the trick of words from the dictionary
There is also the work with Peter
There is a situation to do cool things there
But Peter is a little tough

What more?
Do not know
What more?
Sheeran is debating whether to return or stay a little longer
She wants to stay
I have no problem with it
She loves her father more than I do
That&#39;s fine
I guess
It&#39;s a little stressful
But it is understandable

What more
What else will I tell
I have nothing
mere
Passes the time until retirement
Three four years is a lot to move
I was happy to just enjoy the day to day
And it&#39;s a turn
It&#39;s not so bad
But I do feel like I&#39;m waiting to end it
Maybe if I had been in a study it would have been different
Maybe I need more freedom
You were now on a week off
Do not know if it helped
I feel currents all over my body
do not know what it is
Maybe I should go to the doctor
Maybe I should work four days, two days working all day to cover for it
Then I will have 3 days off a week
Maybe
I can try
What else?
This seems to me
Work, family, hobbies,
I want to go more to escort girls or something
I need validation
I would love to go to strip clubs but they are closed
Anyway there are still escort girls
Good
So it closes for me some evening two a month
What about the rest of the time?
what am I doing?
Walla
Do not know
I do not know what I want
Video Games?
Want to play computer games?
Do not know
Watch TV shows?
YouTube?
Okay
I need some interaction
I need people maybe
Maybe
That&#39;s why I love this porn site
Because reward has an interaction
As with Ashley
Maybe I need people to talk to me about things that interest me
Maybe forums
Maybe chats
Forum has the Reddit
Chat have you? Who can I quote?

What else?
I have these currents all over my body
I&#39;m going to the doctor


Before:
M1 = 100g
M2 = 1g

1000=100*V1’+V2’

10000*(10-V1’)^2=10000*(1-1/100*V1’^2)
99-20V1’+(101/100)*V1’^2=0

(10-(1/100)*V2’)^2=V1’^2
100-(1/100)*V2’^2=V1’^2
100-20/100*V2’+(1/10000)*V2’^2=100-(1/100)*V2’^2
(101/10000)*V2’^2=2/10*V2’
V2’=20000/1010~=20
M1(V1-V1’)=M2(V2-V2’)
M1(V1^2-V1’^2)=M2(V2^2-V2’^2)

Meditation in writing
what do you want?
Do not know
If you had a million dollars, what would you do?
Do not know

I want a computer to solve algorithmic problems
Right now it means identifying important sentences,
Identify important words
Generate code from the important words

How do I know what I am enjoying?
You just feel it
You love it you want to do it all the time
What do I want to do all the time besides masturbate, or sleep?
I want to know how to survive in the wild
I want to know how to achieve financial independence
I want to know how to study, I also want to learn, I also want to excel
I want to know how to get girls

In all these things there is the desire to know
What is knowledge?
A collection of concepts and relationships between them

Know - it seems to me it comes from the root opinion, the way to see the world

Maybe all a needy person wants is to fuck as much as possible and sleep the rest of the time,
Are not all monks really happy
After menopause, do women just want to sleep?
As stated in the book, we are dominated by culture rather than by genes, because genes do survive anyway
Or is culture just a means of genes for us to survive?

Not everyone likes philosophy, not everyone cares

There can always be things that distract me except when something is really in front of my eyes, passion

Like stopping this stupid war confrontation, bringing into the world a means that is not oil to propel it, so that the Arabs will need another way to get money, to experience the difficulty in life only under God
Why did Galileo care if we walked around the sun or vice versa?
What do I do with this life
Buena 7.5% in San Jose, it&#39;s strong!
With 7.5 if I need ten a month, 120 a year
120/0.075=1600

Women are the stronger sex
When I look at who is influencing me right now it&#39;s mostly women
There is a divide and a rule here
We come because of sex and are always fucked
They are different from us by 1/26 or so on chromosomes
It&#39;s some 4%
Dogs are more like us
At least chimpanzees

Knowledge is power because information is energy

Information is a lack of entropy, which is precisely energy that can be realized
So knowledge is the realization of energy
As power is the realization of energy (the derivative of energy by place)

If one looks at history as a collection of coin tosses on one side good and one side bad
So in essence life is fair

How can there be more irrational but between every two there is rational



Suppose there were only 10 digits
That is, in binary the highest number was 1111111111
Suppose we look only at the first 5 digits
1111100000 and 1111100010 are the same for us
What is the chance that we have fallen for a number that has not been repeated in the last 4 digits
The options for repetition are
0000
1111
0011
1100
0101
1010
All arrangement options are 2 at 4:16
That is, the ratio is about a third between &quot;rational&quot; and &quot;irrational&quot;
Each n digits has 2 in n options, and sequences of 1 to n / 2 (must be repeated at least twice)
That is, we have 2 in i options when i between 1 and n / 2 is an engineering series whose sum
2^(n/2+1)-1/(2^1-1) ~= 2^(n/2+1)
The difference between the sums is about 2 in n
The ratio of the sums is about 2 in n / 2
When n / 2 is the same order of magnitude as n


Being with one woman is the closest you can get to being alone

The world is really divided by continents:
Europe, North America, Australia (South America) - Western culture (Latin subculture in South America)
Africa - Blacks
India - Indians
Asia - Chinese (there is also Russia which is half Asia half Europe)
Middle East - Arabs and Jews


Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
It was a tough day
I did not have the strength to work at all
do not know why
I think I work here less well than at work
do not know why
It seems to me Sheeran
Oops
What do I do with her?
It was really hard to have sex with her yesterday
In general I do not know if I enjoy sex with her so much
I need to talk about this with someone I guess
Good
What are the options?
leave
It will really suck her
I also do not know if I will find something better
But you do not have to find something better
Stay sucks me
I do not know if I&#39;m fucking more than staying than she&#39;s fucking for me to go
I guess she&#39;s gonna fuck more
But I&#39;m more important to me
By how much?
Good question
It&#39;s hard to quantify that I guess
Assuming there is work to be done we will divide half and half
If she has a job, I&#39;m willing to help
Some?
How much of my time goes to it?
About a quarter to a half
So I&#39;m two to four times more important I guess
Although some of the time goes to me?
Lol Good question
I guess even between a quarter and a half
Another half goes to work
My money goes half to me and half to both of us
So basically it divides three-quarters for me and a quarter for her, so about three times
Okay
Will she suffer three times as much as I suffer?
The truth seems to me that if I suffer I will suffer forever
She will suffer for several months maybe years
But at the level of suffering it is hard to say
Good
What more?
I&#39;m thinking of sending Elizabeth a link to Messenger or Skype or something

What nonsense
A good idea
Okay
.
So what are you telling
Walla does not know what I&#39;ll tell you
So what are you saying
OK I don’t know 
line

Multiplying by 3 is not a problem
Simply multiply the number by 2 and add the number
for example:
10110101101
3*
=
101101011010
10110101101+
=
1000100000111

Divide by two is the opposite action, you need to find a number that if you subtract it and divide the result by two you will get the same number
for example
1000100000111
-abcdefghijkl
=
Abcdefghijkl0


For another seven years, with the help of the name, I will be free from work
Although I will not be free from family,
But at least I will have ten hours a day five days a week to do what I want
What do I want?
Do not know
Will probably change
I am currently working on this qr
That might release me before the end of the seven years
Although such a project is supposed to take an order of magnitude of several years
So if you already have a project, why not something that interests me
Suppose language processing
The end goal is that a computer can understand speech
Pass a Turing test
But what is it to understand?
To have a representation of what it is
Let him have a model of what is said
That can turn text into a three-dimensional model
But what about abstract ideas?
How to imagine &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;what is the situation&quot;
How do children learn to speak?
At first they speak gibberish
Then slowly they wait for what others are saying
״אבא״ ״אמא״

Baby Talk: The 15 Most Common First Words
1. Dad (or Dada, Daddy, Papa, etc.)
2. Mom (or Mama, Mommy, Mum, etc.)
3. Hi (or Hiya, Hey, Heya, Hello)
4. Buba (or Bub or Baba)
5. Dog (or Doggy, Puppy)
6. Ball
7. No
8. Cat (or Kitty)
9. Nana
10. Bye
11. Duck
12. Ta (or Tata)
13. Baby
14. Uh oh
15. Car
These are words that the child hears a lot
The child is waiting for the environment

When learning a language, what are the first words?
The most common words
But when learning a language, we already have a representation of things in mind
Maybe you can learn everything from movies?
Subtitles is the language
What about movies for kids

Need to test a machine that uses the principle of &quot;shooters connected together&quot;

I may have more insights after the course

How about predicting a 3D structure from a video?
There are many things that can be done

Do you even need a visual imagination?
Are blind people less intelligent than the rest?
How does a blind person imagine?

You can do anything… what do you do?
Eat + coffee - 10$
Fuck - 500$
Eat + coffee - 20$
Attraction - 30$
Eat - 10$
Go out - 30$
Sleep - 100$

Total - 700$
A month - 21,000$
A year - 250,000$

Fucking is the most expensive.
3 times a week, so it’s like 200$ instead of 500$, that’s 400$ a day, 12000$ a month, 144000$ a year


I’d like to have a way to program on my phone
I can buy that app for 10
Not a problem
Next

What do you want to do this weekend?
I’m upset I didn’t get an offer from JP 

I would be happy if I had some notebook that always works that I can turn on from my cell phone
It seems to me Google is giving such a service
Semc
It&#39;s always them
Why they win everything
I can pay Amazon about ten dollars a month to get something without too much computing power
But that should be enough
The notebook interface on the cell phone is also not something
It is also not that convenient to write code on a cell phone
Because you have to constantly move to the signs

How to solve it
Why do you need two devices one with a big screen and a keyboard and one with a small screen
After all, the big one is also mobile
But not that mobile
He did not fit in his pocket
As if in the middle there is an iPad
And an iPad with a good keyboard will have a situation that is enough
Because computing power can be in the cloud
An iPad is really more portable than a computer
But much less than a cell phone
If I had a mobile keyboard for my cell phone?
Comes with a dual screen or even 1.5 I would settle for
And what do you do with the keyboard?

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
So there was a good question from the psychologist
What are the options and what are the pros and cons:
Leave the situation as it is
+ Chance for a family
+ Chance that no one was hurt
Chance of breaking up a family
Restrict to myself the freedom
+ Chance for a family
I have no freedom
divorce
+ Freedom
- No family soon
- Chances are Shiran has no family at all
I can try to put numbers
Family is not very important to me, but neither is not important to me, say 7
No one is hurt, do not know know whether to count it, it is not positive or negative (maybe 5)
Family breakup can be a very problematic event, maybe 2
For me to live without freedom is also very problematic, maybe 3
Freedom of divorce is greater than the freedom I have now, because I will hire can bring girls and such, so maybe 8
No family is the opposite of 7 so 3? If 5 is the middle
Chance that Sheeran has no family is also really problematic maybe 2
What are the chances?
I think that even if I get caught there is a chance that there will be a family, then it tends to be okay, let&#39;s say 30%, and the chance of me getting caught is in my opinion less than 50%, so let&#39;s say a total of 15%
85% that no one was hurt
The chance for a family is quite high, just depends on the effort we put in, so I would say at least 90%, and even 95%
The chance that Sheeran will not find someone else is quite low, say 10%, maybe 20% in the Worst Case, and then the chance that they will start a family maybe even higher than now, but let&#39;s say 95%,

So what are the numbers?
leave:
7
Mol: 0.15 * 2
סכה״כ:
7.3/1.15 = 6.34
limit
7
Opposite: 3
סכה״כ: 5
divorce
8
Opposite: 3 and 0.15 * 2
סכה״כ: 11.3/2.15 = 5.25

So it seems that staying that way is the most logical option
Divorce also has the economic interest
As long as there&#39;s nothing that makes me go, I stay I guess
Psychological thanks, it really helps the truth

What else?
Not too much
Still Paul Power on the interview in less than two weeks
Good
I have a plan
I feel like I&#39;m doing what I can for the interview, it&#39;s no longer in my hands what&#39;s going to happen I guess
I do my part, as long as everything goes well and there are no restraints
I would really love to be accepted
Lisa is not coming either, so I do not feel a tension between two options here
Sucks a bit how she plays me
I&#39;m ashamed that no one else flew over me
It seems to me that they are kicking me, but no one really comes and says
Maybe it&#39;s not something they say?
Do not know
I&#39;ll just come every week to someone I&#39;m most blunt about, even if I already was,
Maybe I should have gone to Christiana, what a worth
Just if I had already been and received the compliment, I would not receive any more information
Maybe but go again, show me if she&#39;s still bastardized…
If I went back
Because once really everyone flew at me
So what? This? Am I getting too old?
Zivna apologized and called him
What a soul this man is
He does not tell too many
I&#39;m not the truth either
Another reason for Google that I can come back with a job



How to write code on a cell phone
Tachles using vim
But then it&#39;s a little hard to write in Hebrew
Maybe it&#39;s better to write in English anyway

So according to the table it would be best to use wrike
I&#39;m still undecided
Really Wrike looks good
But a few things
Can I use it for work?
Can I use it for a project?
Can I use it with Sheeran?

It&#39;s okay I guess to separate tasks from projects
To manage my projects I can either use Gitleb or Beatback
I do not know of such a free version of Python
Then for tasks you can stick with Apple&#39;s&#39; tasks

If I really work in Beatback, then there are also two options:
Work with their regular issue tracker
Or work with jira
This JIRA is not bad at all, it came second on my lists

Another option was to use a trac or build something of my own

All the latest options (JIRA Trac or build something on your own) force me to pay for a monthly server

I think at the moment I will try to deal with the built-in service of Beatback, and with &quot;tasks&quot;


What&#39;s Hughes Case
I have a project let&#39;s say relocation
Inside there are sub-projects
For example, making a credit card (which is actually part of building credit)
Need to read a bit about credit cards (say 5 documents - an hour)
To make a credit card I need to do a card comparison
I need to compare the tickets from my bank (4) to the tickets from several sites (say 20)
I have to do Excel and choose

How does a dog get stomach cancer?
All my grandparents had cancer
I probably will too if nothing kills me first…

I&#39;m spending a lot of my life at work right now
Constantly chasing the hazelnut
I need to plan the hazelnut instead
I&#39;m sure I can save a day a week like this
A day for braces or personal projects

I have missions, radars, emails and a calendar
Best if I could unite everything
In short everything has to be done through radars, won the most orderly
If it&#39;s not a mission of the moment, it&#39;s worth having a radar

Choice: Taking an option from a collection of options
Freedom: Ability to act at will only

Freedom of choice: the ability to take an option from a collection of options at will only

How do I make the most out of today?
What do I want to accomplish?
I don’t know
If you don’t know where you want to go, it doesn’t matter which direction you take.

I build this, put 30k, get 300
I move on to duplex, 50k, get 500
I need 10 of those.
Can I do 2 each year?

50k should get me 500 a month
I should be getting 1500 right now
2000 next year - 24k a year
2500 the year after - 30k a year
3500 the year after that - 36k
4000 the year after that - 42k

I have no power
It seems to me it is because cannabis is leaving the system…
I feel poop
What to do?
What will make me feel better?
What will do me good?
sex
Good…
Something else?
Do not know
What else is there?
Maybe alcohol?
Food?
Shopping?
water!
Well what else?
Do not know, what except?
Do not know
There is no outside
I need to end the proposal to the syndicate
I may need an attorney to go over the PPM

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
Tomorrow I meet with Elizabeth
With God&#39;s help
we will see what will be
We need to finish scheduling the Lugas trip
what else?
The Google interview
I have a plan
Kind of
It seems to me that it will be okay in the programming interview
In a computational learning interview do not know
Need to learn for it
Good
what else?
Do not know
It no longer seems to me
there&#39;s more
I have some arrangements to make
Financial agreement for example
The license
What more?
there&#39;s more
But less urgent
Good
When do you do it?
Do not know
I have no power
We did nothing all day
Sheeran is depressed
Because I&#39;m not nice to her
What more?
Do not know
There is not too much
The psychologist is fine I guess
What more?
We&#39;ll probably start treatment early next year
Also fertility treatment
Good
What more?
Do not know
I have no power
I&#39;m a little depressed
Oops
I do not know what to do
Good
What more?
This
I talked to Zivna and Daniel today
It was nice
Ziv dreams of becoming a startup for stylists
I talked to Daniel about money
He says he needs $ 8 million
He says that with how much he earns it is not enough
Because he wants to buy a house
Because you have to buy a house
That I do not think it is true
The chances of the landlord coming to evict me are pretty low
This is always the reason why to buy an apartment
The question is how much is it worth
This insurance
Suppose you buy a house in this country 4% at best, usually 3%
But suppose 4%
You rent at 6 thousand, a year it&#39;s 72, so a house costs 6 * 12 * 25 = 1.8 million
So you put on the 20% side it&#39;s about 350,000, which you would make 8% on
And a mortgage, which is pretty low, comes out to about the same money
So the main difference is the initial capital
And you pay for repairs and such
That is about 30,000 shekels a year
The question is whether you would pay 30,000 shekels in insurance that would not blow you away
Mortgage payment does not change though
It depends on which route you take
If you do not index-linked then it is fixed forever

What am I doing with my life?
What do I feel passionate about?
There’s nothing…
I feel there isn’t anything…
We’re just monkeys…



We agreed to put half in the shared account, so that should be split.
But I understand, this is not feasible, so I agree to add to that 25% of my accounts.

The other side is that Sheeran lost years of work
I do not necessarily agree with this argument
I think language should be no less difficult to find work.
There is a lot of supply here, the most in the world.
There is a lot of demand here but there is also a lot of demand in the country.
But Sabba let&#39;s say she was working at that time
She would probably work in the country and then earn half of what she earns here.
But Sabba, let&#39;s say she worked here, she probably would have earned what she got in the jobs she did, which is about half of what I earn.
The claim I got half at first is inaccurate.
My base salary was about half, but in addition to that I also received bonuses and options that roughly double the income, which other places do not get.
But Sabba, suppose she was earning as much as I did, so basically she should get what I saved in three years as compensation
This is of course ridiculous
So half?
But what about my compensation
For those three years I was the sole breadwinner
I paid a quarter of the income for it
So what&#39;s left of it is another quarter.

Is the real world transitive?
Transitive is that if a&gt; b and b&gt; c then a&gt; c
But suppose a paper stone and scissors is not transitive
And there is this section in the election
If you add a candidate it could be that someone else wins, because it will split one side for example
But does that mean non-transitive?
Not necessarily
So there is a breaking of transcendence in nature?
Maybe people would prefer A to B and B to C but C to A?
I think so
Suppose there are 3 divisive issues
And candidate A for issue a
Candidate in favor of subject b
And in favor of c
A vs. B: Candidate A will receive votes for A, candidate B will receive votes of B.
C votes will get suppose candidate a that more supportive than b
B vs. C: Candidate in votes of B, C of C, and will go to C because C is more in favor of B
C vs. A: C of C, A of A, B will go to C because more in favor of b
parable
The world is not transitive
All mathematics does not apply to him
I wonder at what level it is starting to become transitive

I have full emails of recruiters
Can be interesting
Although not bad for me
I would probably switch to Google or Neurlink
But other than that it does not seem to me

There is the startup
There is the investment in the syndicate that needs to end
There are the study statistics
Google&#39;s course

The startup is supposedly urgent because every week there is a meeting
The most important thing is the statistics
Maybe Google&#39;s course can cover that
Can I try to do both?
I can try
So on the go Google course
And the start-up at home?
I can do the course as part of the trip there
I also need to do the fast ai course
If we really meet on Thursday…

So the rest of the recruiters are irrelevant…
I&#39;m not really looking at the moment
And what about reading what needs to be read?
This is what I usually do when traveling

1 - doesn’t have a common denominator
2 - has common denominator 
3 - has
4 - has
5 - doesn’t have
6 - has
7 - doesn’t 
8 - has
9 - has
10 - has
11 - doesn’t 
12 - is the number
So what will I tell
There is not too much
Went for a walk at work
But what about life itself?
I wanted to see if a recession could be predicted, but it did not seem simple
I thought about why religion?
I do not know if I have an answer

What bothers you?
Not too much
Maybe I can only sleep with one woman?
And I&#39;m not closed on that either
Like, would be nice if I could, but do not know if it&#39;s the most critical
Go to work?
Maybe, maybe it&#39;s annoying

For the millionth time 170 income, 65 living, 65 savings, 40 tax
In total there should be more tax, it seems to me because it&#39;s just one income, so it is divided between the two of us

So now 230
Another year 230 + 65 + 23 = 320
Two more years + 65 + 32 = 420
More 3 + 65 + 42 = 525
Another 4 + 65 + 52 = 640
Another 5 + 65 + 64 = 770
More 6 + 65 + 77 = 920
Then half a year to retire…
With God&#39;s help

In the meantime trying to promote retirement, in total with 10% I should be able to retire another 4 (with 650 thousand)
But turn around, let there be 6 for safety



On the one hand I want a day that I do what I want
On the other hand in the end I do nothing

Do not know what to do with this life
Where are the days? Where are the days?
I&#39;m a real poet

Hey
What&#39;s up bro?
Do not know
I&#39;m addicted to sex live
It drives me crazy
The interaction with the most beautiful girls I have seen
And they all fly
Well maybe not flying
But turn around with me
Some more Some less
so what are we doing?
Walla I have nothing else
The project I put aside until I take some vacation
My brain is too busy right now
Also the divorce and everything
Name the party in the meantime

what else?
There is not too much
Every second I have a checker on the site
But I can not really do by hand
Because I have to keep the semen for Sheeran
That&#39;s good I guess
But I still look at the site all the time
This is what I most want to do
Tachles I would just travel to Colombia or Russia and make names there

okay, well
What else?
There is not too much
I get to talk a lot with my parents
I try to reduce the free hatred they have for religion
Religion for them is opium for the masses
The truth is that religion makes people happier
And I think it&#39;s better than addictive opium
I wonder if religion is addictive
I know it&#39;s hard to get out of this
But also not easy to get into maybe?
Do not know

I still do not understand the connection between fascism and the economic right
In the beginning the right was the supporters of the monarchy, you could say that fascism and monarchy go together
And on the left was the bourgeoisie and the poor
Once the monarchy disappeared, the bourgeoisie constituted the right and the poor the left
The bourgeoisie are the capitalists who own the business
The left supported more communism and socialism
So basically the question is who is the ruler, in communism the ruler is the communist party, in fascism the ruler is the dictator / king, in capitalism the ruler is the money
What is the connection between religion and fascism?
The rule of God, God is the King?
Do not know
Communism does not contain religion, but denies it


God
Why worship?
Worship makes society better
Is there less violence among believing people?
Probably not since they are of a lower socioeconomic status.
What if we control for socioeconomic status?
Still more violence less happiness in more religious countries (even when controlling for GDP)
So why religion?
To improve organization?
Why did religion survive?
Why was religion stronger than humanism in Rome?

Maybe Religion is social energy. It keeps social agents (people) closer together, and makes them stronger, more resilient to enemies and disasters.

I would be happy if I had another way of doing what I am doing right now
Suppose we write it down in the wiki
But there is nothing with offline capabilities
Soon we will not need offline capabilities
Because we will always be online
Then I would like to use a service like GitHub
That I&#39;m straight writing code, like suppose a notebook,
And I can in the same breath also write todo


It seems to me it has to do with dbquery
But it&#39;s more than that
It&#39;s turning text into a graph
for example:

My dog also likes eating sausage.
turn into:
nmod:poss(dog-2, My-1)
nsubj(likes-4, dog-2)
advmod(likes-4, also-3)
root(ROOT-0, likes-4)
xcomp(likes-4, eating-5)
dobj(eating-5, sausage-6)

Dog
Mine
Likes:

Sausage


Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers felt like an autobiography

advmod(received-3, Generally-1)

good so
what am I doing
What am I doing next week?
Work on market forecasting? About natural language?
Maybe you can combine?
A natural language in the capital market?
It requires reading comprehension
I need to know how to read stock reports
The goal is to avoid the next fall
And get ~ 10% on the money

10% is seven years 7% is ten years

So what do I want to do with natural language?
I want to talk to him
And that will answer me

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
I have a lot of work
Do not know if I am so enough

Sucks a little Ashley
She does not want to have sex with me
And it looks like she&#39;s with someone else now
okay, well
I asked her how she had not yet fallen in love with me
She said she could control herself
In general it seems that I am more interested in her
Maybe because she&#39;s at the head of is far away, he&#39;s just on the computer
And I think about that I would be hired to fly there
As if maybe my world is smaller
There is also the section of language

okay, well
What else?
Do not know
What else?
is nothing

I sent a request for a meeting with the therapist regarding my and Sheeran&#39;s problem
She does not want to sign a financial agreement
She says I or we need treatment
Sabba
I have no problem with it except it&#39;s just time consuming
But okay
What else?
Do not know
Zivna comes up with a new project
Wants us to do Spitz to Action
As if extracting tasks from speech
Sounds cool
Do not know if we&#39;re there right now
But what do I care to do a project with him
Have fun

It is true that everyone has a desire to maximize return and minimize risk,
But we also have a limit to the amount of work we want to do at a given moment
If I now look at my possible alps, I may not take one of the two because there will be too much work in it in the short term
Hey whats up?
All is well
What about you?
Sabba
Who is this second girlfriend?

In short I want to do full of things
I want to produce music automatically
I want to make a game like civilization
I want to start up
Good
What more?
This
Good
So do
What first?
whatever you want
I do not know what I want at the moment
Good
So do nothing
Maybe I want to play a game
I did a game at Unity
I do not remember it being difficult
Took me some day seems to me
Okay
The next step is to make a board game
Interesting to read the timeline of the world
Try to make it a little more structured
Then build the game from it
When all the timeline options are possible

Let&#39;s start with the fact that I do not know why I am recording
Who will read it?
I need a more orderly thought and then maybe write a book

Of money
The one who contributes more earns more
Suppose there is a certain amount of money that is received, then the larger the portion distributed as a donation the larger the next amount will be
People will still consume now, that must, but less,
It is thus possible to normalize the distribution of income
The problem is that it requires a central system, and it never works
Maybe if the system is man-free, and there is no room for corruption, then it will work
Maybe computing can do that, a system like Bitcoin
Maybe it&#39;s a normal distribution creature
Currently the distribution is abnormal
In communism a normal distribution such as a delta function (it is possible to register a delta function as normal with a standard deviation tending to zero)
The Gini index aspires to communism, only when everyone has equal income, the slope of the graph is fixed
For a normal distribution the slope will go up to the middle, and then it will fade away, because the decrease in the number of people fades faster than the amount increases (income increases linearly and cruises fade exponentially)
In capitalism the slope only increases, the income increases faster than the distribution fades
Is it not directly due to capitalism?
If I give free market, can I predict how income will be distributed?
Everyone takes raw material and turns it into something, and earns the difference between how much it cost him and how much he sells
Most often the raw material includes his personal talent, the price is determined by supply and demand
If the thing is rare and sought after its price is higher
Suppose a simple world
There are only 2 products, and two people, one produces food and two produces clothes
They can simply agree that one will produce the food for both of them and the other will supply the clothes
It is possible to determine that the time of food production is equal to the time of production of clothes, and then they simply change product after working the same amount of time
The problem starts when there are fewer types of consumer products, because then a certain product can take over a market and lead to a monopoly, and then capital is concentrated in one place, over a few people.
For example: housing, communications, money (bank), food, transportation,
The truth is that it&#39;s almost everything
In housing, everyone wants to live in Tel Aviv
In the truth media they put in competition (there are still only 3 big companies)
The money has 3 large banks
In food there is about one type of food company
There are also relatively few companies in transportation (and huge taxation)
There is nothing to do it also stems from the fact that we herd, tend to cluster around one product



Fermi Paradox -
If within the order of millions of years we are supposed to take over the entire universe given that it is free
So any culture that has emerged in the last billion years would have already appeared, it should happen in those million years, low chance of a collision between such events
The chance that two life forms will be created at the same time is like the chance that we will take 10 corn kernels and the first explosion will be of two kernels at the same time
For 100 nuclei the chance of two exploding together is low (rarely happens) and the difference between 2.5 minutes and a tenth of a second of the explosion is much lower than a thousand
The truth is that the ratio is pretty much the same, there are 100 nuclei and 600 tenths of a second in 1 minute, and there are 10000 suitable stars and the difference between a million and a billion is 1000
The chance that exactly the first of about 10000 explosions will be of two is not high, because it happens about one in 10
(Ten every million years, out of a billion that everyone &quot;explodes&quot;, at first it explodes every second or so, that means a 1 in 10 chance, it&#39;s about the amount, so maybe it&#39;s about 50 50)
Assuming a normal distribution it is like measuring 10,000 people, and that the two lowest will be about the same millimeter, or the highest
After all, this chance is certainly lower than the chance of taking just two people from the range where the heights are closer (around the average)
And around the average the chance is low, so sure it is lower at the edges
No matter how many people there are, the chances of me choosing two at the same height is nil
Although with 10000 in the same 1000 it should be quite common. The chance that this will not happen in a given second, is that each teen will do it separately,
If there are enough (say 10 ^ 10) then it is likely that the lowest are at the same height, because most people will be at the same height, then they are divided within a range of meters, but still the chance of taking two averages at exactly the same height is to my detriment,
Ok because it&#39;s not true it&#39;s not like choosing two at the same height, it&#39;s the chance of having someone at the same height for someone random, and that chance is actually high in the area around the average when there are a lot of people
In this world there is a billion and the chance of it is low, there is someone sure of my height, but the peak of the low is probably alone there, in most competitions the result is normally distributed, and the peak is one, most Guinness records are of normally distributed phenomena, and there is almost always one peak, and reasonable Assuming they represent all human beings, if there was someone better he probably would have tried, most people (at least in the western half) know the Guinness records
Conclusion Chances are there are no aliens
Walla


Puzzle:
Or with him the sum, or the difference of the other two
He knows that if one is listed 65 for the other X and the third is listed
Y = 65 +/- X
Two sees 65 and Y
Tuesday sees 65 and X

Suppose
Y = 65 + X
It cannot be that X = 65, Y cannot be 130
It cannot be that X = Y
I want a situation where
Y = 65 - X
Cannot exist, i.e. Y = X
It will not happen

Suppose
Y = 65 - X
Then need a situation in it
Y = 65 + X
Can not exist, because Y = X
That&#39;s not going to happen either


Automatic tag retrieval
Each topic gets tags
That way you can know what I&#39;m mostly writing about
You can also divide the tags into groups, to see topics, and domains
It needs to find a hierarchy between tags, closeness between words
 
Why do I need input?
Because my brain is constantly processing it is simply its static state, there is a constant flow of energy to the brain, and if there is no input it is

What’s the idea?
Try to predict the next year’s indicators (gdp, company revenue, etc...)
Maybe try to predict indicators according to government spendings
This way there’s a game of governance
There’s many more stuff that’s hard to predict, like wars and stuff, but those should be sparse by nature
I don’t have enough data
I can buy I guess
Right now 
But it only includes a very small part of the data…
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Now
Tell me more
What do you do when you don’t have enough data?
Can you learn from a small number of examples?
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
What else?
Think

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
All is well
I&#39;m pretty bastard from the live porn I found
It&#39;s nice to have some interaction
But Sheeran pretty much caught me
Also with the Premium Pornhab
And also with Porn Live
I do not know if and how to ask her about it
What I want to get out of it
See if she notices
Or if she keeps it as a card
I do not trust one hundred percent that she will not take advantage of this
I do not feel I am doing anything wrong
But it&#39;s still a little awkward
Shortened it down a bit for me

Good
What else?
This week is not working on the project
Next week I can continue because I got approval from them
Sabba
And what in the meantime
Rest tomorrow
What else?
Do not know
What do I want?
Maybe you should meditate
What else interests me?
politics?
Of money?

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
I had the interview on Friday
There was nothing
In the first interview I was really slow
Do not know why, probably because of pressure
I did a warm up with some two easy questions before, not knowing why it took me a while to wake up
I do not know if she passed me, guess 45%
In the second interview he was fine
But it&#39;s hard to know
There&#39;s a situation I completely missed
But suppose 55%
A third interview was reasonable until he asked a code question, not complicated but due to time pressure I did not come up with an optimal solution
Here too it does not seem to me that I passed, he asked questions of knowledge and I answered, but do not know if I answered correctly
Maybe 40%
Your brother had a planning interview that was fine I think, 55 maybe 60
I&#39;m doing a behavioral interview that also went well, it seems to me, really hard to know, maybe 55
Oops
But it&#39;s hard to know
we will see what will be
This
But over
I sat on this thing for two months
I learned a lot
It gave me a lot of motivation
That&#39;s good
This week I think I can rest
I have but all kinds of arrangements
I have to make the financial agreement
And we need to do couple therapy
And I have more things on the list
I also wanted to work on the investment strategy
The idea is to take what maximizes the historically low 5%
Because that&#39;s how they concluded that it was quite safe to attract 4% of S&amp;P
So maybe going for a strategy that maximizes it can increase the pace of attraction
The problem is that it usually does not indicate future results when there is not much history
So if I really want to find a good strategy I need a lot of data
Let&#39;s see if there is data
I can download with Yahoo
Good
I can take the list of stocks in the investment basket that includes the entire market
Extract for everyone all the information from Yahoo
And work on it
I also need to think about what sampling does to the distribution
Basically suppose I have 10 options, and I choose 2 of them
The smallest number
2 - 1 1
Ach 3 - 2 1 and 1 2
Ach 4 - 2 2 and 1 3 and 3 1
5 - 2 3 , 3 2, 1 4, 4 1
6 - 3 3, 2 4, 4 2, 5 1, 1 5
This is a pretty linear truth
In the middle will be 10
Here you can come with any combination of a pair of numbers
There are 20 combinations
Is it linear with any amount of numbers?
What would happen with 3 numbers
3 - 1 1 1
4 - 2 1 1, 1 2 1, 1 1 2
5 - 1 1 3, 1 2 2
6 - 1 1 4, 1 2 3, 2 2 2
7 - 1 1 5, 1 2 4, 1 3 3, 2 2 3
This too is pretty linear
In the middle there
15 - 1 4 10, 1 5 9, 1 6 8, 1 7 7, 2 3 10, 2 4 9, 2 5 8, 2 6 7, 3 3 9, 3 4 8, 3 5 7, 3 6 6, 4 4 7, 4 5 6, 5 5 5
But the combinations grow, if there is importance to order
And it increases according to the amount of options, although for 3 different numbers it is always the same amount of options to arrange
So that&#39;s not the point
It&#39;s pretty linear
If it&#39;s linear, then the 5% is in the 10% range it seems to me
Why because if I have a triangle, then 5% of the triangle is where?
If it was a right-angled triangle, then 5% is 10% that should be squared for space
Even if it&#39;s not a right-angled triangle I guess
Not really
If it is not a right angle then there is no resemblance
5% is 10% of the right half angle of the isosceles triangle
So that means
Wait then for a right angle of 10 length, if I take a piece of one length, let&#39;s say the height is h then the height of the piece is h / 10 then the area is h / 20 relative to the full area which is 10h / 2
So the ratio between the areas is 100, then a tenth becomes a hundred, the square because of the area
So 5% is 1/20 or 1/10 of the half, so to get to this ratio in the field, need together of a root of it in length, I mean ⅓ about
But is that a third of the half?
Suppose the length is 40, then the length of the half is 20, then the area is 10h then the third is 13 and the area is 6h
So no, you need a third of the half, I mean a sixth, it&#39;s 7 and then the area is 1h = 3.5 * 0.35h which is a tenth of the half and five percent of everything
So need the amount instead of sixth
interesting
I wonder if it really works
Anyway I&#39;m not sure this is the right way
I think the 4% comes from the fact that it&#39;s half the average percentage for the times when the market falls by half
Although order should not be important
If it fell in half sometime, it does not matter when
Or maybe it matters, because the rate of attraction is constant
So you want to earn long before this fall…
Do not know
Basically when I did the calculation for the S&amp;P now, I did not take into account the attraction, and reached around 4%
By and large it is always possible to withdraw 8% of the portfolio, the only question is where it went down
So what&#39;s the point of taking the low 5% or the 95% not to crash
If every decade there is one year of collapse, then there is a 10% chance of collapse, but a 90% increase
Suppose a 10% decrease of 50% and a 90% increase of 10%
Like currency,
So how best to invest in such a situation?
Do not know
And what is the distribution of a sample in such a case?
Why not take the product that gives the best Sharp ratio, and leverage it
Take a loan and put on it…
Why not?
The more general problem is that the past does not necessarily indicate the future
Approximately yes, until he does not
This is another experiment
Just take the best Sharp ratio that year and leverage
I wonder what size loan I can take
How much do I need?
By and large I suppose can take a loan of 100 thousand, put in this stock,
Or I can just buy an option of the stock
But I do not have the information about it
On a private loan take 6%
That sounds like a lot,
The market is doing some 8% and I do not know if it is index linked

Hey whats up?
fine, what about you?
Sabba
So what?
Walla does not know
I have no strength to sing anymore
I know Elizabeth is probably not the answer
She barely speaks English
And she has depression and mood swings
nobody is perfect
The question of whether one really must be with one person
Why not just be with all the girls on this site
Or escort girls
Until maybe one day I want kids, or someone
But what to do
I do not want to hurt Sheeran
But also do not want to hurt me
What to do?
Do not know
Maybe I need a break
Maybe
Good
What else?
Do not know
There is the interview
I went around with the Litcode questions
But do not so much know what to do with System Design
And with Machine Lerning
And with Google
Good
So what&#39;s the plan?
Do not know
Basically System Design, I just need to make as many examples of large systems as possible, but how do you put a machine into running? Probably systems that use machine running, I have some sites with examples, I can go through them - it&#39;s some week
Machine Lerning, maybe I should try to write the Transformer myself, and maybe also the similarity search, maybe some challenge in Kegel - it&#39;s some week
Google - I can go over the questions and write 3 anecdotes for each, also this is some week
Then I will have about a week or two to go through everything again
This week I have four days left
I can take advantage of them to do what I do in two weeks
Good
Maybe it&#39;s really worth going over to System and Machine Lerning this week
After that I will have a whole month to go over what is needed
That seems enough to me
So this week&#39;s program is:
System:
Go through relevant sources of information - there are some ten, I think it will take some half to a day
Go through examples of questions - I can do some 2-4 a day
Machine Lerning
Write the Transformer - what a day
Write the similarity search - half to a day
Challenge in Kegel - half to a day
I have 4 days
How to divide it? A whole day for everything?
I guess you should do the transformer that day
So yes maybe a whole day is better for everything
Okay we&#39;ll see what we get

What else?
OK
I want to meet Lisa, but have to get up in the middle of the night for this
I also do not want her to get tired
Good
so what are we doing?
I&#39;m also with a beard, because I shaved early last week
I better meet her tomorrow
Good
What else?
That&#39;s about it
Another week back to work
we will see what will be
What more?

I should probably give another 4-5 years or so
It sucks a little
But I&#39;m lucky
Most people can not retire so early

All she does is watch shows
It sucks
It feels like she&#39;s going to be like her dad
Good
What else?
Do not know
Say you
There&#39;s the project I want to do from Machine Lerning to Chip Design
But it&#39;s currently on hold
There are many more things to do
The most urgent financial agreement
And umbrella insurance
There is also the license that needs to be arranged
But maybe you can wait with that
Good
What else?
Wait with the rest too?
The project this month is the Google interview so my focus is there
In any case, do not return to Israel soon,
Good
So rest on hold for now it seems
Good
What else?
Do not know
What else?
I hope to be accepted and then go out for some two months vacation
Good
What else?
If I do not receive?
Please
I learned a little about

what&#39;s going on?
Walla Sabba
Not too much
Still a little horny
Do not know what to do with it
I do not know if masturbation is what will help me here

What else?
Not too much
There is the project
how is he?
I need some to-do list to see if I can finish the project

What else?
Waiting for Kaka
How about writing code here?
it&#39;s not comfortable
How about writing code in speech?
Can be interesting


Ashley really happened to me
At first she was actually cute to me
But then some 3 days passed
Then she would be cold
Maybe because I did not come to her again until then?
Maybe
She&#39;s beautiful
It seems to me that I&#39;m giving up Sheeran if she tells me yes
And for Hannah?
Good question
Do not know
Hannah is amazing too
really
Oops
How much money does it take to own so many women?
How long do I need to reach 2 million?
It works like this
((1+I)^N-1)/I
That it is exponential in N
I need to find the doubling time
In my opinion 7 years for an interest rate of 10%
That means after 7 years we have
(2-1)/0.1=10
After 14
(4-1)/0.1=30
After 21
70
Suppose I save 100,000. After 7 years I have a million.
Suppose I need half a million and a woman is half a million.
So after 7 years it is possible to hold a wife.
After 14 5 women are allowed.
And after 21 - 13 women.

What I do with the project
I was thinking of developing from the iPad
But Sheeran uses it
Afraid to use the work computer not to say it&#39;s Apple property
I can take the computer to Sheeran
But he is not something
After all, I&#39;m married
So chances are half goes to a woman
I have another 4 years to decide
And she also needs to start working

what&#39;s going on?
Walla not too much
mere
Spends the day
Ashley meets Yiziz
And it really makes me jealous
I know
This is a cool site to cherish
There is an interaction
I got to talk a lot with Ashley
And there&#39;s Lexley
Trying to work on people
And it can be understood
She&#39;s trying to take care of her sick brother
The truth is I did not ask what he has…
Maybe I should
It is really beautiful and worthwhile but busy
She managed to get me some $ 50 without getting anything
Twice!
But there is interest
It&#39;s fun to do c2c with girls and get validated
They usually fly over me
so that&#39;s it
This is my new hobby right now
I just need human interaction I guess
This is a segment
I always thought I did not need it

what else?
is nothing
At work goes slowly
I am considering doing Vipassana next week, to see if it helps my mental state
Cleans my head a little
Or maybe I should even go to some brothel in Mexico
Or Brino

refrigerator
Micro
Oven
Air-Conditioner
How could they have invented the air conditioner so long after the refrigerator?
Mountain heater heated by heat (gas)
Micro heater by waves Col.
Air conditioner refrigerator and gas heater
And refrigerator gas refrigerator
I was trying to understand why the media is leftist
It seems to me that there may be more consumerism of leftist values
More leftists are consuming media
It may also be because media owners are resilient people with leftist views
On the other hand I would expect them to be more right-wing as business owners
I noticed that two of the larger media owners cbs and nbc are Jews
Jews may be more inclined to the left
Maybe because of the Holocaust
Or because they are a minority


Sheeran&#39;s birthday
What to do?
What are the options?
Buy her a present
Take her for a fun day
Take her to Disney
Take her to Yosemite
Take her to the minister


I want to have a state of the art bot
Least distinguishable from regular conversation

Year 1: Replicate state of the art
Year 2: Investigate flaws
Year 3: Improve state of the art

That’s one research paper, probably no need for 3 years for that…


Good
What now?
Good question
Let&#39;s start with &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;
Walla everything turned around
Day off…
Pretty
And how do you take advantage of it?
I went here to Aroma in the Grand…
Drink coffee and pastries
Sitting impressions impressions
here
Impressions
Maybe a blog is better…
Maybe…
Maybe a Jupiter notebook is better…
Maybe better
The best truth would be if I always had some open notebook
The truth is best if I had some open server
That I can run a notebook from
That way if I want to do some service, I can get away

Good
I made a notebook
Let&#39;s see what happens with this
What now?
See if I can run a notebook from it
then what?
We will see if it is possible to access from the cellphone
then what?
We will register there
And what about Hebrew?
We will register in English

Shortening is not the simplest

Why do I need it at all?
Because if I want to start writing a web app, I&#39;d rather do it straight in the cloud
As if this is not something that happens every day
But why not actually?

The problem is that you need a certificate
It&#39;s solvable
I just do not have the strength
Because I do not know how much it will already contribute
And I do not understand why it does not work at the moment
Good
Next
What else but my brother?
How will you feel from Basot when the holiday is over?
What do you want to get from her?
Oh I remembered another hobby
Startups
Okay
Investing in startups can also bring in 20% so I sign
Well come on it seems to me we will continue to the bathroom
Good
But then I can not go back
Maybe actually I can
Good

So what do I do with my life

The closest way to overcoming death is through a chip that will connect to the brain

If this chip is similar enough to a brain cell, then we can replace a cell cell from the brain with an artificial chip, we&#39;m done, we&#39;ll live forever

Suppose an artificial neuron costs a million dollars (because it&#39;s a lab budget)
Every two years his price dropped by half, as long as Moore&#39;s Law.
In 40 years it costs a dollar.
Then at $ 80 billion you can build an artificial brain.
So double a small part, a quarter of a brain, $ 20 billion.
In 60 years it will cost 20 million
Walk is worth it.
Maybe this is how it will be possible to live forever

Her parents want to come here
She&#39;s lying for security
Security is important

Okay
So in the beginning there was agriculture
This evacuated part of the population, probably the elderly, to non-survival occupations
So what did they do? Invent the painting, from there the writing, from there maybe the story
These stories united cultures
In short all the writing comes from the same place
All languages come from roughly the same sources
Probably because there were few centers
It was better for each group to learn the language of the group stronger than it (with which it may trade)
The centers began near rivers
do not know how
Abraham came from the Euphrates region and the Tigris came to Canaan and then went to Egypt
Literally moved between empires
But they had been there before
How did they start?
There may have been hunter-gatherers who used the hunting tools to take over agricultural villages

So for example in the Bible there was Abraham Yitzchak Yaakov / Israel his 12 sons, who became tribes, and Yosef who went down to Egypt
After a few generations there was Moses, who brought the children of Israel out of Egypt
It&#39;s just families that grew up really, that&#39;s how it sounds
And the father of the family was a kind of ruler
In the Bible the prophet is the one who chose King Saul and then David
The story unites everyone who believes in it

Then the kingdom passes between the firstborn

Why new elections…
Maybe to get back all the right-wing votes
But actually I think they had a vote transfer agreement
I don’t know
Why do I care?
Because there’s stuff going on in the background that we don’t know, and it bothers me

So what, do I just sleep all day, wait to die?


How to do tricks with words



I have too many places with things to do
Miles
Reading List
Asana
Tasks
How do I center everything?
This is similar to what happens at work

By and large all missions should be in asana
I need to download more than I put things on a reading list
I can also enter the emails

By and large, emails are usually more urgent matters
But I just need to put them with a date

The reading list does not really work
I do not deserve everything
At work I barely finish what&#39;s in the mail

I just have to decide what&#39;s important

The list is also not synchronized between browsers

I can not just meditate between people
If I were here alone, what would I do
Maybe nothing
Maybe working on the project
But maybe I&#39;m too engrossed in the project, and it&#39;s good to get out of it a little
So maybe invest in gamification
Maybe reading financial reports
Cannes academic
It was cool to invest in something that turns a book into a course
Maybe just messing with the things of the job
This week I did not have time because of the full tasks
Need to arrange the work arrangement
Week to create drafts
A week to do a review
I want to have to give it only one day a week
What makes a book a course is amazing
It is also possible to use computational learning
Can also be used to teach the machine
In short, everything I do is for the better
The idea to do something I love
The hardest question is what I like

What about politics
There are full economic studies
Is it possible to put learning here
Produce an economic model through computational learning?

If I can predict countries&#39; improvement from information, it may be possible to use it to manage countries as well
There are full of beautiful things
Full of projects
I would love to have all of these projects accessible
That I can contribute when I have an idea
The same should be done with the model of the second law
Not simple but also possible in code
It is possible with square bodies because it is probably easier
Although traffic is restricted to very specific directions
How can you really move diagonally in a digital world?
Is there a minimum angle?
Quantization of motion
Large bodies have infinite ability to move
But minimal bodies can only move on one diagonal, apart from the usual directions
Wait a minute if there is a tunnel, maybe there is no limit
Let&#39;s try this digital world
If there are problems we will talk about them

I need to write it all down in an honest project
I need to analyze what I am recording somehow
Most things can be divided by type
I need to do a classification for the sentences I write
Each sentence has a role
Perhaps any sentence can be made to take action
There are todo sentences
There are knowledge theorems
and so
It may be possible to divide the documents into types
Maybe inside you can divide the sentences

What to do?
I can do Kaggle already
I can work on my project

On Sunday, the sleeping beauty retires to sleep. Before falling asleep, the experimenters tell her that they will wake her once or twice, depending on the result of a fair coin toss: if the result of the toss is a &quot;tree&quot; - then a beautiful tourist only on Monday. If &quot;Fly&quot; - it airs once on Monday and again on Tuesday. She is also informed that after each awakening she will receive a forget-me-not drug, which will erase the memory of the previous awakening, and will lower her again. When she wakes up the beauty is asked what is the degree of belief that the result of tossing the coin was a &quot;tree&quot;.


There are three options, that the result was a tree (H) and today a Monday (M), that the result was a fly (T) and today a Monday (M) or that the result was a fly (T) and today a Tuesday (T)
The first option has a 50% chance of a second 25% and a third 25%
But if I say Monday today, what&#39;s the chance that a tree came out? 50% So I actually added information, I&#39;m supposed to increase the chance no?

If we were to repeat the experiment for two weeks
The chance of H
P(H) = P(H|HH)P(HH) + P(H|TT)P(TT) + P(H|HT)P(HT) + P(H|TH)P(TH)
P(H|HH)=1
P(H|TT)=0
P(H|HT)=P(H|TH)=⅓
=>
P(H) = P(HH) + ⅓*P(HT) + ⅓*P(TH)
Assuming the same probability for all options we get
P(H) = ¼ + ⅔*¼ = 5/12
And it&#39;s not half
Assuming that
P(HH)=⅙
P(TT)=⅓
P(HT)=P(TH)=¼
=>
P(H) = ⅙ + ⅔*¼ = ⅓



We are special because we are capable of programming
You can program us
There is no other animal with such a mechanism
We sometimes think and come to a decision junction that activates the decision network in the brain, this network considers many factors before making a decision. Sometimes also factors programmed by our knowledge. In the case of humans it is not limited to private knowledge but to collective knowledge (even in some animals it is not limited only to private knowledge but in a much more limited way). The collective is able to program the individual, and that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing, it brought us here.
We&#39;re basically like a computer,
A day will come and most people will prefer to give birth to their son at home in a computerized version, and that will be the end of humanity in its present fleshly form (unless computers have flesh and blood then, because that might have an advantage)
Perhaps genetic programming will increase our abilities to coordinate any computer that can be produced in any other way
By Moore&#39;s law, our head is supposed to hold the entire amount of information for each amount.
What to do?
Startup?
Work on finding a partner
Pitch company
Talk to someone from the industry?
New product course?
Stripe code redemption
ML?
TF courses?
Assess skills?
Probability courses?
RE
Refinance
COVID
Taxes
Buy flight tickets
Check lost item from burning man

I have too many lists
There&#39;s the email
There are reminders
There is the table of things to do
There is also asana

so what are we doing?
It seems to me that we will first finish with the taxes
Need to study for an interview
For this you need to study System Design
What about computational learning courses?
Maybe you can think of a startup
The question is what comes to me
How about producing music?

Not a good thing I write like that all the time
It feels like the military
I went back to the frame
In the year of my release and at the Technion, I did not do that
It does not seem to me that Weizmann did that either
I can check!
2008 - At the Technion I wrote a bit
2013-2010 - I wrote once or twice
2014 - 5 times
2015 - quite a lot
2015 - now - a lot
It&#39;s getting serious
I focus on the past or the future instead of the present
Focusing on the now may make you happier, but less smart
It seems to me
Pretty sure about the happy but not sure about the wise
So why am I doing this?
order
Maybe when I get off work I will feel it
Maybe that&#39;s the job
Maybe it&#39;s the woman
If divided daily into three
That&#39;s five, two for sleep and three for waking
Two-thirds go to work on Wednesday
A third can go to a family
I currently give half a third to a woman
And on weekends I give a day and a third (if you do not count sleep)
So 10 parts go to work,
0.5 * 5 + 4 = 6.25 per family
I have left
2.5+2=4.5
But suppose at liberty I get the 10th, and the family can stay the 11th
Maybe I should take some more part
I want myself 11, the family can get 10 and all is well

Indecision is also a decision
She postpones the decision to a later date, then I have to deal with the problem twice
This basically doubles the problem

All I can think about is this freedom

I want to see beautiful things
But I can not see beautiful things here
What beautiful things I can see here
I can browse the cell phone for a moment

Well the cell phone does not connect to WiFi
By and large I can surf without WiFi

But a pity about the data
Look inside if you want to see beautiful things

This nothing is crazy

What do you do?
is nothing

So what are you saying
Listen, Tachles was cool about making money with a car
Although in 500 I have an escort girl
Is it okay that this is what I want?
It&#39;s like what&#39;s best for all parties
I do not want to leave
I do not want to hurt
I&#39;m going to an escort girl behind my back…
Sounds really not like in the movies
I would ask her
But I do not want to hurt her
&quot;Mami, I do not want to leave you, do you mind if I go to escort girls?&quot;
Need two houses for an escort girl
Hallucinatory
You can not be an MK and go to escort girls, I guess

I want to start recording in a notebook
I can use this colburator
But enough with Google
They got scary

I can create my own environment
The problem is it&#39;s a fucking dollar an hour
Ten hours of work and that&#39;s ten dollars
And in Google it&#39;s big free

I can run a notebook from Dropbox
And what do I do on my cell phone?
This is actually the problem
It cannot be done from the cell phone
And there does not seem to be a solution to that at the moment
Probably in the future
I can open a notebook
But only if it is in the cloud and I can access it all the time
By and large it can be done

At Amazon EMR it is a quarter of a dollar
That means I have 40 hours a month to reach $ 10
If I work 50 * 20 = 1000 it comes out $ 250
Lots
If I&#39;m willing to pay $ 20, let&#39;s say
Tachles is the Worst Case
The average will probably be low
But certainly not by much
And in Google it&#39;s free
Well then Floydhab is $ 8 a month
You can check it out

And now I keep writing in Google Drive
It&#39;s the most convenient
Maybe next time I&#39;ll move on to Floyd Sr.
I can move on to Floyd Sr.


People spend most of their spare time watching tv
Mostly watching sports or other competitions (regular broadcasts) 
Or watching comedies (netflix) 
Entertainment
We want to be entertained
We want to not be bored
We want to get some emotional reaction
Not surprising

I better concentrate on what I&#39;m interested in
I&#39;m not creating a new code language for sure
I need as much as possible to use what exists and add only what interests me

I have 24 hours every day
It&#39;s usually 8 sleep 8 work 8 my
And sufs that it&#39;s two days of my 8 hour sleep 8 hours
From my time there are arrangements and family


Hey whats up?
Walla
Not too much
We met Javier yesterday
It was nice
But they are really leftists
I think Lila got a little annoyed with me
But it&#39;s really hard for me with this hatred
Do not know
As if once someone is really safe on one side, I feel the need to take the other side

I&#39;m really glad I found this video chat porn
That&#39;s really nice
Like it&#39;s not like doing it with someone
But once someone equal tells you you&#39;re handsome, it feels good
As if from all those I tried one told me that
One said I looked smart
And one said nothing
But she seems to have been from Basota
Do not know
It&#39;s a bit of a human connection
It&#39;s nice
With more people
Maybe I just need to talk to more people
Just find forums and join the conversation
Do not know if there is such a thing
There is the Reddit forum
Maybe I really should attend more there
I can also try to get into chats, but no one gets into chats anymore

I want to find some way to do cam2cam without the site
That I can eat from my cell phone
Although it seems to me that it is temporary
Only because the new version is not yet supported
I wonder if there is a way to do video chat, without giving too much information
I can pretty much give up my Facebook
And talk on Messenger
Or my WhatsApp
Do not know which of them is more important than the truth
I guess WhatsApp
Facebook I add people I do not know
But I do not share my phone easily
relatively
Maybe Skype?
Maybe Skype
But then how do you transfer money on Skype?
Do not know
And Nemo?
Complicates a bit
Good

What else?
What do I have to do before the flight?
I need:
pack
clean the house
That&#39;s what I&#39;ve got in the meantime
You can finish in one evening it seems to me
Not easily
But it is possible
Wednesday evening flight
That means tomorrow night is a rush
What am I doing this week?
It seems to me it&#39;s pretty much eliminating my week
Folds tomorrow
The next day they fly
Thursday still in flight
Friday at the hotel
Saturday at the hotel
What have I been doing at the hotel all this time?
Regular
This week I will probably not work on the project
So what will I do?
I will rest
What do I have to do
A
Sheeran says I need to see the apartment for myself
I can fly to see some contempt apartments
what else
What do I need to buy an apartment?
I will read the book
But by and large - see apartments, make an offer, if accepted do a check, find financing, sign
Your brother has to deal with the day-to-day maintenance, find tenants, repairs, ...

So what&#39;s the hazelnut?
Look for apartments
Make suggestions

Maybe I need more agents to have something to compare

Read the book

What more?
There are the startups and the second law, and I&#39;m also not sure I&#39;m happy with how I write assignments


Why am I so nervous?
It annoys me that Sheeran now feels she is the victim.
She arrives in Paris a place that everyone dreams of being and she suffers every moment.

But she claims she feels imprisoned because she does not speak the language, and has no money to enjoy here, and no support for me.

But I have no money for her to enjoy here, and she has no money to enjoy the country either.

But here she has no language.

So stay in the country

But there I will not be

So what can be done?


Really annoying question made a tool like mine
I have something to do with it?
Just flow, no need to do anything.

I do not know which laptop to buy
The old is good, but the new with the new connections

what else?
There is the distance
There&#39;s the Challenges
There&#39;s Sheeran

What will
Also had the huge bug in my code
Which somehow still works
Beyond that he contracted also passed


So Ashley will not keep in touch with me
I can understand her
It probably will not develop into a relationship
Although I do not know if not
But the chances are slim
We do not speak the same language
She probably will not pass
I probably will not pass
Good
Next week last time I will see her
we will see what will be
I&#39;m really upset
I guess that&#39;s a good thing
Healthy to feel
For a long time I did not feel
But Bassa is in pain
Good
What more?
Do not know
I finished?
My dad beats alcohol at home
Freaking out
what can we do
I think at his age I would just smoke all day
My mom is just addicted to doing things
That it&#39;s a spin
If it&#39;s good for her
That everyone will do what makes him good
This is true?
That everyone will do what is good for him, is that good?
There is such a section that sometimes to get high you need to go down a bit
The question is whether he wants to get higher
It seems to me he did his thing
He seems a little angry at me or something, does not know what the point, does not know if I care
like I care
But I also care about myself, I see no reason to flatter
Good
But anyone who does what is good for him is basically the missing hand
It&#39;s basically God
So from selfishness we get progress
It&#39;s not intuitive
So most people do not believe it
But is this also true outside the economic world?
I think yes, there is nothing special in the economic world, it is just a measurable part of the general world
Good
Something else?
This guy with the skateboard has brought so much peace to the world
He just did what was good for him
Suppose what&#39;s good for me is to leave her
It will hurt her
The total amount of happiness, do not know if it will rise
Because we avoid risks

I would like to write here
And that it will already become missions

I need to find a solid investment, bonds
I need to transfer the money to the trading account
I need to understand tax matters in investments

This is as close as possible to the notebook on a new page

what is going on here?
All yesterday I was looking for escort agencies

I do not know what the point

The problem with asana is that I do not know what to work on
There are a million things, but there is nothing that means turning tasks into a calendar
By and large it should be of the least important importance
Then from the urgent to the least urgent
Even though I&#39;ll not get enough urgent stuff like that


I checked how computers do it

In Windows and Mac it&#39;s pretty simple:
There are queues with varying degrees of importance
A queue with greater importance gets priority
Those who are in one line for a long time move to the queue with greater importance

In Linux:
Always take the one who has the least time left
If someone does not finish in the allotted time, the time they have left increases

It still does not really meet the urgency
I guess in the end you have to decide on what has a higher priority, and add priority to urgent things

There are systems where there are two types of priority, where one type takes precedence over the other, and can replace something with a second type of priority

Such a thing can cause only urgent things to be done
That is why the amount of urgent things should be kept to a minimum

What urgent things should I do?

Nothing is urgent for me at the moment


I need $ 2 million to live on NIS 5,000 all my life plus $ 5,000 per child for the next thirty years
If I build on live up to 120
Why because I have 120 years on 5000
5000 is 60,000 a year, double 120 is NIS 7,200,000 about $ 2 million
But come on, if I work on 10,000 shekels for 30 years and retire, then I end up earning everything I needed, which is 120 * 30 which is only 3.6 million shekels

In this pension fund, an employee who earns 5% every month
The employer adds 5% and another 8.33% in compensation
Then I get at the end 50% of the income forever
That means I will get at the end 18.33% * 30 = ~ 512% and then I will live from 50% for much more than ten years
Probably 30

I can in theory earn twice as much and then quit at 45
But then I have to pay for ages 45-60
Another fifty percent, that means a million and a half dollars
Not really
I can just leave the rest of the money aside and then pay myself at 45
Then you only need 20% for the provisions
In any case, you need them


I want to work on something that interests me this time
So why not natural language, if it&#39;s interesting anyway?

A million dollars, how do you make a million dollars?
That a million people will buy something from me for a dollar


Ugh I&#39;m pretty addicted to this site
It&#39;s just that cheap for a minute
80 cents
For virtual sex
This is the closest thing to sex without cheating
At this rate I bring Hannah here
Then it will not be so virtual
I have to limit myself to 3 times a week

Today I was with Hannah for twenty minutes
It&#39;s supposed to be ten
Suppose a quarter of an hour at a time
With Hannah it&#39;s 16 per minute means 240
With Ashley or Carolina it could be 120
So on average it&#39;s 180
I start with 2400
So I have some 13 sessions
In
That means divide into 4 weeks
3 a week

And now I&#39;m just handing out money

Oops
It&#39;s addictive shit

Sheeran is angry because she thinks I&#39;m trying to get her out wrong
Because I&#39;m arguing just because I want to be right

I don &#39;t like her arguing with me even when she&#39;s wrong
She does not admit that maybe I&#39;m right, ever


Then the light passes from side to side
But then the checkpoint is forever
Every object has a potential for movement
This is because e = mc ^ 2
Each particle can have any velocity up to c
So it has potential from the very ability (potential) to move
But as he moves, so does the potential of the movement
Yes, but it starts with zero potential
It&#39;s another energy, kinetic energy, if you give up weight, you pay in motion
This is the distance from zero mass
In the frequency space we move coordinates to the velocity axis (not the weight)
The higher the frequency the more energy there is, then there is energy which is the distance from zero frequency

חחחגחגחחחחחחחחחחחחחגחחחחחחחחחחחחחחחחחח חַחַחחחחחחחחחחחחחחחחחגחחחחחח.

Maybe there&#39;s something there, maybe not
Maybe feeling is important enough to know how to go in that direction
But what&#39;s the point, it&#39;s not what I learned

So what&#39;s the hazelnut?
Good question
Maybe I should just correspond with myself


Well I need to find an investment
What are the options:
Fundrise
Realty Mogul
RealtyShares
Intoo
rreaf
Patch of Land 


I would like instead to write here, to write in a place where you can also write code, and run it.
I can write in Gittlab in a nutshell
But I do not know how to fix it,
I can write there,
Do not know if in Hebrew
Too bad there is no normal user interface, that I can also do without internet, but I guess you can always get internet, it becomes like electricity and water.
Tons of data - because you can generate from a computer…

If we have a 3d model, and we can extract all the shapes, and their location/orientation in space, we can train a model to predict those shapes + orientation + rotation, 
Another way is to predict the distance of every point.



I need something like tasks to write tasks
But it bothers me that it is not hierarchical
I can do this hoim

The engineering average must be done, because in the end the result is the product of the values
But what is equivalent for a standard deviation
If you replace an amount by multiplying by multiplying by a fraction
So for standard deviation:
std(x) = (sum((x_i-e(x))^2))^1/2
std+(x) = (mult(x_i/e(x)^^2))^^½
What is it ^^
If * it is a strong product it is **

Multiplication is ++

Multiplying x by y is to add x to itself y times
Raising x to the power of y is to multiply the x itself y times
Raise x to double the power of y is to raise x to the power of y twice
But what is it to multiply by a fraction?
What does it cost to raise a fraction?

It might just be better to do the accounts on the log of the percentage changes

 
Living room - living room, the default room
Toilet - Personal waste disposal room
Kitchen - dining room
Bedroom - bedroom

In the studio the living room is also used for sleeping and preparing food.
The toilets should be separate for odor and waste separation.
The kitchen is usually adjacent to the living room, and there is no significant separation.
The bedroom is separated for privacy,
The bedroom can contain its own bathroom, and thus exist as its own house, as a fractal

A bedroom contains a bed for sleeping, and closets for storing clothes.
The toilets contain a shower for self-rinsing, a toilet for disposing of needs, a sink for secondary rinsing,
The kitchen contains cabinets for storing dry food and utensils, a refrigerator for storing &quot;live&quot; food, an oven and a microwave for heating food for preparation for consumption, a sink for washing food and utensils.
The living room contains seating utensils such as a sofa and armchair, and a table for placing objects

What does a man need,
Clothes, food, a place to sleep, and running water

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
What about you?
Everything is fine
So what do you say?
Not too much
We had a social vacation
With Anna and June and with Monixa
That&#39;s a nice thing
See more faces
Now the last full week before Christmas break
I am considering taking 3 days to have two weeks off
Why not
If I finish everything I have it seems to me that is what I will do
I was at a satellite was shit
Next time I do not think I just have to go
Good
what else
Do not know
Say you
I still do not know what to do with Sheeran
We need couple counseling in my opinion
I can not wait for the next time she erupts
Good
So what
Do not know
The project now is to study for Google
I guess solve top gloomy questions
Because they actually gave a specific level to solve
Good
What else?
Do not know
There are also systems
And there is also a Lanning machine
Each one is a project of a month
And I may have a month
I&#39;ll ask her if she really needs a month
What more?
Maybe there are Seattle deals

So how do I represent a book using a graph
I create a graph from each sentence
Graph is a relationship between words
There are graphs that are repeated a lot in the language
Relationships are the special words
Then you can put a relationship between all the words and that&#39;s basically all the makeup in the world
Just need to add who said what
Although it is not known if this is important, as long as it is true
Maybe do it on all the articles in the world
Everything there should be right, right?
And if something does not work out, it could be a problem that needs to be solved

Interesting to see the distribution

What do I do with my life
I want to do a simulation of reality
One might start from the behavior of one person
Although one person is less predictable than many people
How to do a simulation of a lot of people
Maybe I should write it more conveniently
I would talk on the phone if I did not know that people are listening
It&#39;s a little annoying
Need to check out this section
Maybe I should report it
Invasion of privacy
Anyway until then
I register like this
Top-down simulation
From the high looking, GDP let’s say, to the details that make it up
The truth is I never understood what makes it up
Maybe it&#39;s worth me to look
Need to read
It represents the amount of product in a particular place
The product is how much the test body produces
It consists of private, public consumption, investment, exports less imports

What&#39;s up bro?
Walla Sabba
Long weekend
Pretty
And how you utilize it
Do nothing big
Also important
So what&#39;s going on?
Not too much
Yesterday I saw the series about Epstein
But mostly I was looking at a live porn site
This is a nice truth concept
You can have virtual sex with real women
It&#39;s porn porn
It&#39;s a little more human contact than just watching porn
It costs more
But it is not expensive
Suppose about $ 30
It&#39;s not sex
But now is Corona time, so there are not many options

I also worked on the project yesterday
I&#39;m a little stuck because of the upload to YouTube
I can meanwhile just create a page with all the videos in place
But this is not ideal
There are still issues, it does not work smoothly, even without uploading to YouTube
But I do not know whether to invest in it when I&#39;m stuck with YouTube

What else?
Next week I&#39;m at a conference
My first conference basically, but it&#39;s just online
Do not know how it will work
Hope it will be interesting

What else?
Do not know
politics?
This Epstein was linked
Really feels like there is another world above us
Although we did the calculation with Trump
Which is supposed to be a part of this world
If inflation is not taken into account, the 40 million he received should have been 70 times that today, which is 2.8 billion
Which is about what he has
This means that you can go from being a millionaire to a billionaire
But then why are not all millionaires billionaires?
There are 330 million people in the US
About 20 million millionaires
And about 500 billionaires
So basically one in 16 is a millionaire
And only one in tens of thousands of millionaires is a billionaire
This means that it is harder to get from a million to a billion than from nothing to a million






So ~ 10% (one in ten) reach a million
~ 1% (one in a hundred) reach ten million
Less than 0.1% (one in a thousand) reach one hundred million
600 out of 300 million which is ~ 1 per million reach per billion
40 (one in 15) over 10 billion
1,2 (one in 30) people over 100 billion




If in the whole world there are 2100 billionaires and in the USA 600, then we can assume that there is a ratio of 2 to 7 for the whole table
So the table will look like this:



So basically over 100 million has only 0.004% (4 per hundred thousand)
Over 30 million have 0.01% and not 0.1% as the second source claims
One can make an average between the two and say
That around 0.3% over 30 million

So so:

It is much harder to reach 100 million than 10 million

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
We met today with friends
It was nice
refreshing
It is important
Sabba
What else?
Not too much
I told a psychologist about my condition
we will see what will be
I do not think she can advise me what to do
But maybe she&#39;s going to have some interesting input
Sabba
I study for interviews but I feel like I&#39;m burning my brain
I do not feel I am getting better
On the contrary
I feel like I&#39;ll just get harder

Monday they go for a walk
I was happy to join
But I do not know if I got it
Sheeran needs to study so you will not be able to join
I too should largely learn
Good
See, I guess
This week you will probably ovulate
But I have to wait for the cycle for the day off
It&#39;s not the week, it&#39;s a week bro it seems to me
Good
It&#39;s a menstrual week
Interim week
Ovulation week
Intermediate week and back for goodness sake
Good
What else?
The truth is I&#39;m really supposed to go to the office
Not this week
Maybe next week
What more?
Another two or three years for Maniac
I should ask them to wait until mid-April to have more shares
Now at the end of the month I should get some 20,000
Then in mid-April much more, because Apple&#39;s price has actually gone up
Suppose 60 thousand
Brings me to 700
That it is already after the second third
Depends on what I&#39;m aiming for
Probably a million won&#39;t be enough
But how much?
So if 6 percent is half a percent a month, and I need 6,000 or 72,000 a year
If I need 60 a year, then a million is enough
5 a month
But if I want 6 a month, it&#39;s another 20 percent, it&#39;s 1.2 million
And if I want another 10% of ten, it&#39;s 1.32 million
One million and a third
How long until then?
5 years or so
I will hold on
Another three years will not be really terrible to retire
Good
What else?
is nothing
I miss Lisa
But she does not really want me
Nice to her attention
But if she really wanted me she would come here
She does not do that
A little bassa
Also what&#39;s the point that no one else is flattering me anymore
I&#39;m getting worse
do not know why
I do not feel I have changed
On the contrary my eyebrows now look better
Do not know what the point
When I was stoned, two girls did not flatter me
One of them did seem to enjoy watching me masturbate
The other seemed really uninterested
Maybe in the section of who it seems to you that you are
And this week there was someone who also did not flatter, but it seems that she enjoyed
Do not know
Tachles also Lisa did not compliment me on the beginning
So maybe not everyone is just flattering
Yen didn&#39;t flatter me either, but she seemed interested
Good
What else?
Do not know
What about you?
It looks like June is leaving town
I actually really liked him
This corona really sucks
Good
Nir is also cool
But we do not have much talk
Maybe if we go for a walk with them
Maybe
By and large I need to learn
Maybe I&#39;ll learn enough tomorrow, and then I can go with them
Maybe
Good
What more?
Do not know
I feel a little stuck because of the interview
It&#39;s pretty much my whole life right now
So I do not have much life
Good
It&#39;s only for the next three weeks
Good
we will see what will be
What else?
Do not know
There is not too much
Good
Okay

Sooooo
What do you think?
I don’t know
2 things:
Freedom
Financial
Personal

QnA

I need to be free

Let’s do the zipline thing…
Nope
Too complicated…
Don’t feel it’s worth it…

4 years
100 paychecks

Stanford…
House…
Startup…

I need a hobby
But I don’t feel like doing anything…

Random words…

Bla bla bla

I have nothing in my head right now…
I’m just bla

I’m just living…
No passion
No nothing to live for…
It’s just seeing life going by
I mean, if we have AI we might be able to live forever
But I don’t know how to do that

I just 

Do not know
What more
What else can be added
Tomorrow another week begins
One in two hundred
Who still remained
I see nothing but freedom
I&#39;m thinking of working while working to finish with this first
I would work double if it would bring the freedom in half the time
I might be able to do those flips that are talked about in the meetup
This is an option
I can do my degree at Stanford
Do not know what it gives exactly
It gives degree points
But instead maybe I can write an article

My brain’s empty…
Lalalalalalalala
I just want to do nothing…

Good,
I have to read one document from the read every day
Every week follow the pending, let’s say Monday night

We are just processing units
Machines with input and output
We can use plants and soil and create agriculture
Use guns and create casualties
Use words and create knowledge

So suppose it&#39;s a group of monkeys
They can move
They can use something to produce something
They can eat
They can act on things

You can set actions separately
All it takes is grammar
There is a subject who can perform an action on an object

Maybe we should start what wh
what
who will
how
Why
When
where
Some

Time and space


So my brain is hard wired for curiosity…
Which makes sense because you need exploration to maybe find a better resource.
So it’s not wrong to choose the red pill.

Where else would sellaism contradict anything I believe?

So we all just want to be happy…

Well I think happiness is a lie.
It’s not really measurable. And is super evasive.
Like a butterfly in your hand.
If you try to see it it’s no longer in your hand.
But then what is flow?
What is the physiology of flow?
It’s all not fully understood. But I know I felt it at some point .
Maybe focusing on happiness can move it further away.

Race and Cue Islands
According to Wikipedia there was a study that found this data:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nations_and_intelligence
[[File:World-iq-map-lynn-2006.svg|thumb|2006 estimates by Lynn and Vanhanen]]

It very much seems that in Africa there is less IQ and in the Middle East also a little less

According to studies heredity explains 70-80%
This means that even if Africa had a perfect environment, there would be less IQ there
In the Middle East this is less true,

Good
This is very politically incorrect
But this is information
Here comes the tension between freedom of expression and political correctness


So what’s up
I did find some topics I’m most interested in:
Money
Real estate
Physics
Biology
Brain
Sociology
Politics
Computers
Machine learning
NLP

What now?
What do you want???
I don’t fucking know
I got nothing

There’s nothing
I want to have sex, that’s it
Strippers don’t work, they just make it worse I think…
Full intercourse is probably cheating…
(hehe probably)
So am I just left with my hand?
That’s awful, that’s sad
I might have to try intercourse to see if that changes anything…
I know that’s bad
But I think not doing that might be worse for me
If I don’t get inspiration I’ll go crazy
I mean I wish I’ll go crazy, but I’ll probably just die inside from boredom

I have no power
ססעמק
I do not know what I want
I do not want anything

I need to be able to run things on aws
I need something like a bolt
It should not be too complicated
This is a total aws in cmd
So all I can do is not run here, I just need to run on a server
But how do I do that from ios?
I need some app that can run aws
I can use juno but it&#39;s just to connect to a server that is already running
How do I run a new server?
I can try to run from one juno to another juno
But then I have to add permissions and such
Shortened mess

If success is guaranteed what would I try:
fly
Cure cancer
Set up a startup
Break Turing
Fuck Bar Refaeli
Find eternal life
Raise my mind to the cloud

I can use a termius but it does not seem to me that anything can be run from it
Maybe from juno





Well then another 45 minutes of the interview
A little stressful
Maybe even quite stressful
All for the best
But I still feel the need to be good at the interview
I did what I could seem to me
I have the second code interviews now
I guess they will start in the medium and continue to harden
Bronze I just fail
But psychic yes
we will see what will be
The interviewer is a computational learner
Do not know if I know enough…
hope so
Achach Aruchat
Brother System Design
Here too I do not know if I know enough
hope so
You have a behavioral interview
Hope it will be good
After all, after that the project is over
It takes me a long time
This way or that way
It was good, but a lot
About two months I prepared for it
It filled me with pretty much all of my free time
I analyzed how long I sat on everything last year but
Can&#39;t remember seeing it the truth
Maybe I have not written about it yet?
Maybe
But this year it will probably show up
January project
The next project is the idea of choosing the facilitator with the 95th highest percentage
This
What more
How about raising your brain to the cloud?
This is also important
But intelligence may need to be resolved first
Although not sure
This professor at Berkeley is doing a really interesting job
Maybe I should go to Berkeley
Maybe
But need to see what the neck bottle is
At the moment it seems to be the surgery to implant the sensors
The sensors are for reading only
But there is a situation where writing through the eye is good enough
Or by voice
It&#39;s like talking to yourself
So why not really put the sensors in your mouth or a little before
Do not know if it helps too much

what am I doing
She disgusts me
I&#39;m stuck
I do not want to hurt her, because to stay at 35 without anyone, and without children is a dick
But what about me
In this case she will hurt more than I hurt from staying
I do not know if I would be better off with someone else
I do not think monogamy is supposed to work
Some people say that their other half is everything
It makes sense that a marriage should be happy at least half the time
Although I&#39;m not sure if my life is happy at least half the time
ססעמק
I&#39;m stuck

what am I doing now
Another attempt to predict the market did not work
I can keep digging into it
At 20% I am free for less than a year and a half. 61 month (5 years) per million
The market makes 7%
At 15% it will take 28 months, less than 2.5 years. 70 month (6 years) per million
At 10% it will take 55 months, 4.5 years. 84 month (7 years) per million
At 7% it will take me 85 months, 7 years. 85 month (7 years) per million
Right now because Apple is doing well, I&#39;m about 11% on average
But nothing is certain
Need to see what happens to the house

The question of whether to spend time to rise from 7%
The truth is I do not even know if it is 7%
Besides that there is also inflation
So 7% is actually 5%

By and large a million should suffice

I can try to predict real estate

Any information available on the Internet is probably already utilized, and the price should reflect it

So by and large if I do nothing I reach a million in 7 years
And if I do something I get to a million in 5 years at best.
So maybe it&#39;s better to just let time do its thing
I have already invested a few years without moving forward
It does not say too much about the future, but there is definitely a situation where I will invest two years and nothing will come of it

On the other hand it interests me
What&#39;s up with the market
Why businesses are successful
How this world works
What affects business

Good 7 years, when I&#39;m 41… It&#39;s not terrible
This is a year above what I thought
Although technically at 40 I can retire
The question is what do I do over time


What now
White page
Empty

If you had a billion dollars what would you do
Go after turing
Is it important?
Why do I need that
I want a computer that can do any job
I want a computer that can do research
I want a computer that can teach
I want a computer that can find a way for me to upload my brain to a computer
I want a computer to free me from the cables of biology
I want to be able to hire a computer to do lab work, to find a solution to death
I don’t mind a computer that is more intelligent than a person, that’s not a bug, that’s a feature.
If you can record all the signal of my brain, 
If you can simulate all the signals of my brain,
You should be able to produce something similar to my consciousness
100 billion (10^11 / 100G) neurons, 100 trillion (10^14 / 100T) connections,
To simulate a brain, you need a 100T RAM. 
This is possible with current supercomputers
But does that matter?
Can I connect my brain to a computer today?
Will I be able to do that?
Probably yes.
I connect my brain to a computer.
I have extra neurons for calculations.




I have full job offers
I should be happy
This is an opportunity to move forward
Although I do not see how I am progressing so much
I think my best chance of being a computational learning researcher is in Apple
And in the meantime I still have previous commitments
I want to finish the investment
I want to study for interviews
I want to work on the startup I do not have

I&#39;m not really working on the startup
The priority is to study -
The investment is expected to end this week
I also want to look at investing in startups
But not everything is possible
So what are you saying?

This week we will finish the investment
We will go over what is needed in workera
And what about the interviews?
Oops

I can put in
Concepts
Relationships between concepts

what if the energy or mass are constant, and what is moving is just time and space. instead of something moving from here to there, the space is moving in the opposite direction
It bothers me that she got mad at me for wanting to tell my parents that her parents are coming, because that&#39;s not happening
And now all of a sudden she says processes are starting
Stresses me that they will move
It will be much harder to come back
It bothers me that her family is more important to her than I am
Not that I think it&#39;s rare for the woman to be more connected to the family, as most men are cocky, and parental love is unconditional.
But it&#39;s still stressful that until I got rid of my family&#39;s stress, I had to deal with a family not mine
And the truth is I did not die for her father nor for her brother
I brought my brother ten thousand dollars which I probably will not see
Dad had a similar story too, he brought in a partner, and lost him full of money that your brother could not return
A friend of his arranged a job for him, and he sued him for compensation for an injury he would have been guilty of
They are also not that nice to me it feels
I can not trust her when she tells me there will be no problem coming back
The truth is I do not know if I can trust them

What if instead of objects we would have tables


What do I do with this life?
Do not know

So I can’t use floydhub currently 
I 
If I have endless money what do I do?
What do I do if money is not personal
What did I like to do most as a child?
Watch TV and play on the computer

Maybe I would make a model who knows how to play civilization

Maybe traveling to the Caribbean

Maybe

Why is it so hard to know what I want?
This is supposed to be the easiest thing in the world

Like I wanted to fuck
I pretty much know that
I tried with an escort girl
There was nothing
She was not worth it, and worse she was not really interested

Anyway if I feel like it
that is not a problem
$ 400 and I did it
It&#39;s quite a bit
But it makes sense
I can also travel to Colombia and do it a lot cheaper
Maybe when I retire and have more free time

Maybe kids at all is the thing
It fills life
Maybe

Good
But what in the meantime?
Waiting for retirement?
for children?

I do not know what I want
If Sheeran had not been here I would probably go to some escort girl or something
But Sheeran
So maybe tomorrow will be sex
Which is also a spin
And in the meantime?
Do not know
What most people do in their spare time

TV
Friends
computer
Books
sport
is nothing
Other things - trips


I can make a one-year schedule according to the decisions
The daily schedule is known (guitar / palms / bible)
Monthly schedule: (Mitap Real Estate, Mitap Natural Language)
The quarterly schedule is also known: (Kagel Challenge, course, project)
What is the weekly schedule?
I can either do a Kegel challenge or a course or a project
What I want
If I have a better idea than Brock
Each of these I have to budget a month and plan a week
Which course? Arabic, natural language, computational learning?
What project? Stock forecasting by news? Stock prediction by fundamental analysis? Bot Q&amp;A?
Which kegel?
It seems to me the best way is this: Course -&gt; Kegel -&gt; Project

So I&#39;m here with people (Sheeran)
So I can not just sit and think


so what are we doing?
What about the startup?
Feel like working on it?
Walla sounds interesting doesn&#39;t it?
Please
There is a situation
It&#39;s quite a bit of work to start something from scratch
The question is whether I want to
It will not take less than five years now to see profits
And in five more years I can be free anyway

I can not be idle in front of a screen
I&#39;d rather see something already

Well then not a startup?
I know it&#39;s something to do…

Technically I can now write code
Instead of Hebrew
I do it sometimes
But only with a computer
What is the barrier to doing this on a cell phone?
How would I do that?
Opens the aws and opens a notebook
It&#39;s not much of a problem the price m maybe a little
That&#39;s a dollar an hour for a good machine
And it seems to me two cents per machine just, that it comes out fifty cents a day and then $ 15 a month, which is not terrible
I can also make a Google notebook that should be free
But it&#39;s not very friendly
then what?
Do not know the truth
I&#39;ll write code, maybe I&#39;ll affect the world
What do I care about influencing the world?

Once again Sheeran got mad at me for nothing
For interrupting her in the middle to say something unintentionally
So she says she got upset unintentionally
And even earlier she got upset
I do not remember what
But know she got upset

Feels he can&#39;t talk to her without getting upset
 
What was promoted?
What is
She&#39;s nervous now
I do not want to contain it

I feel ugly after seeing the video
How can I feel a million dollars and a second later ugly
How It Works?

 
Hey whats up?
Everything is fine
What about you?
Sabba
I did not sleep well
This Ashley is driving me crazy
I showered in front of her yesterday
She was really cute
Although when she&#39;s not seeing me she&#39;s much less cute
Do not know what to do with her
I&#39;m really attracted to her
Not just in the segment of looks
Although it looks like fire
Also in the segment of character
As if she&#39;s depressed too
So do not know
But there is something in it
She&#39;s really trying to be a good guy
She always turns off the screen in private
Keeps the rules right
She&#39;s really pissed she&#39;s there
I do not know why it does this to me
I&#39;m not mad that I&#39;m there
maybe a little
I would have preferred live
Good
So do not know what to do
What will be will be
I really would like to keep in touch with her
Buy her a ticket here
Or travel to it
It can be a dream
What dreams do I already have?
Raise my mind to the cloud?
What else is there?
If I raise my mind to the cloud
I live forever and then I can do anything else I want
Yes
It&#39;s pretty much the only dream
Good
What else?
Do not know
What more?
Do not know
There was a lecture today he talked about blacks in America
On the debate over why blacks are in the situation they are in
He spoke out against the one-parent section
That in whites who choose not to marry no one raises an eyebrow
But it is not the same
When you grow up without a father you grow up differently
You have no man to keep you short
But why do they have single parenthood?
Is it because of incarceration?
Because of drugs?
I think so
Drugs lead to incarceration and lead to single parenthood
Legalization can help here
He did not talk about it
Nothing to do is not completely objective
Although I learned about the incarceration data from the course
I wonder why the episode did not talk about it
okay, well
What else?
How is the project?
This is not the day I was supposed to work on
I have it, I have something else, the truth is I&#39;m pretty done
I need to write down what I did

I wish it was a wonderful year
What to do with?
I would like to write on a platform that also allows me to write code, but on the other hand is accessible from anywhere
I would like ide in the cloud
The truth is that the workplace is in the cloud, so I can edit the documents from anywhere
How do I edit documents what dropbox?
So it turns out that it is possible

Well in the meantime I&#39;m running code, more problematic to write

All is well
What about you?
Sabba
Beauty
Beauty
There is not too much ha…
What are you waiting for?
There&#39;s not much to do right now
We&#39;ve finished what it takes for the week
At work we finished almost everything needed
Tomorrow we can present the prototype
At home, we were done with the news and emotions
What more?
It seems to me enough achievements for the week
It was also a socially busy week
How do I extract all the information from what calendar

X^2+Y^2+Z^2=V^2



Hey, what&#39;s up?
Sabba
What about you?
Sabba
It was a crowded weekend
Monica and Nir and Itzik
Every day was something
It was refreshing
Meet people at last
That&#39;s weird
I was sure I did not need people
But it turns out I do
segment
Maybe that&#39;s why all masturbation
Maybe
By the way masturbating tomorrow I meet Ashley
I still do not know what to do to travel to her
But it will be fine
It seems to me
What else?
Do not know
I&#39;m trying to figure out what to do
Like I do not want to get tired of her or you will get tired of me
Tachles should be limited to twice a week
Tomorrow is pretty busy anyway
I can skip tomorrow
Yes, why not
Make her miss
See what will flow
I also need to renew my license
What else?
Do not know
What about you?
Oh I also need to work on the project this week
Good
What else?
Not too much
I made myself this account that transfers $ 500 to retirement
It should be ensured that the target also has one
Sheeran will also be included
And it is better for Shiran to have 1000 not 500 and twenty years to retire not 30
Good
What else?
This politics is interesting
Even though it&#39;s American
It pretty much speaks from the point of view of winners
As if the founding event of the century is the fall of Brahma
So today they talked about al Qaeda and bin Laden
That in fact the Mogadishu did not really want to eliminate him
segment
The war on terror was a step up but did not lead to an increase in the army
interesting
It&#39;s like the interest is not economic
Or indeed economic if the one who caused it is the mercenaries
But how do you know?
You can see who the biggest mercenaries are
And do they have a clothing connection
If so, it&#39;s not &quot;academic,&quot; it&#39;s all a $ 30 million company
Maybe she&#39;s small because of the omissions
But even then, how small is it?
Aggis is much larger than 70 billion
G4S around the 3 billion
Since the airlines may have a hand in the matter
Boeing probably makes a lot of money from it
Good
But Boeing will survive even without
They&#39;re probably not bad people
But they must maximize profits
It makes more sense that what pushed there was oil
Good
What else?
Do not know
What are you telling?
Not too much
Beauty
Something else?
Do not know
At work I&#39;m a bit stuck with some thing that only happens to me
I&#39;m asking for help from there
What else?

Sheeran drove to her brother all day
That it&#39;s a turnaround for me
Too bad Ashley wasn&#39;t here today
Do not know if she&#39;s running away from me
Do not know what to do with her the truth
Who said Ashley would be better
Hard to know
Especially since Ashley doesn&#39;t even know English
Do not know if it is a barrier
She also lives in Kibinimt
Do not know if this is also a barrier
What will be will be
And if it&#39;s a baby?
As long as the sun is shining all is well
Thermo&#39;s second law says that without energy entropy increases
I wonder if there is a law that says that with energy entropy decreases
Although if you look at the entire solar system it assumes it does not receive energy
So basically her entropy goes up
Because the sun is perishable
What about crystal
It manages itself in a cyclical way without energy

Arranging information by:
By knots - clustering
Hierarchical

OK let’s try it out
I’m not sure what I’m doing I need to think about that I wanted to add scratch that delete go back
So it’s not perfect
There should be a way to automatically add new lines and stuff like that
Or at least add punctuation undo undo
So what else
What do you want to do

I’m not sure 
It’s not very convenient 

Hello How are you?
What about you?
This is the most general question one can ask a man
Or in English how are you, how are you
What&#39;s the way you are?

I&#39;m a little frustrated
I have to work for about 15 years to be free
Sheeran annoys me with how much she can do nothing on her own, and the fact that her belly has grown.
 
What except
I&#39;m working on this project trying to find a way to predict good stocks
I need data for this, but it costs $ 150
I can simulate the amount of data to see if it can predict, for example only using p / e

I have a sea of work at work, and little time

I want a new computer, but it&#39;s about 1000 euros


So I started looking at the topic of hobbies…
The main options:
Music
Computational learning
politics
I can mix computational learning with others…
I can do a course in logic pro for fifty shekels…
I do the course of computational learning of fast ai
I looked a little at the subject of politics
I checked a bit on the Knesset and the government
In the Knesset it is not a problem, or perhaps less a problem to find all the laws that came in every year
In government it is a little harder to know what is being done
I can see the budget
But it&#39;s harder to see what each government ministry has done
I can look at policy pages
I can watch news
One can also look at the decisions of the committees
then what
One can try to predict their effect
For example the cell phones


News2roi2 FastAI
Check revenue on test
Check naive revenue
Add all data
Add FastAI preprocessing
Increase epochs
Tune hyperparams:
Learning rate
Size

There just can’t be a rock that can’t be lifted.
Even an ant can lift a rock at any size given it’s in a small enough force field.


Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
What about you?
OK
So how was it?
There was a turn
I&#39;m glad I found what&#39;s bothering me
Don&#39;t know if I needed that much time
But I think it was positive
refreshing
Beauty
Want to give more details?
At first I could not sit without counting breaths
By the end I was already sitting a whole day without counting (roughly)
I&#39;m glad I realized that what bothers me is having a child without Sheeran working
I think the best thing would be to make a financial agreement

Good
what else?
Walla
Sabba
I think maybe I should get a haircut
The girl today said I was the engineer
And the escort girl
Do not know
There is a situation
Shorter
Was nice with the escort girl
With how much the girls on the site are worth at the end most of the time either I thought about her or Ashley
How beautiful this Ashley is
I can do someone else every month
Suppose it&#39;s around $ 400
That means 5,000 a year
That&#39;s another 50,000 in total
This is another half year of work
Obviously that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing
Maybe even 2
That&#39;s assuming I do 10%
If 8%
So 60 or so
Not terrible yet
In a year&#39;s work
I can earn two girls a month
fun

Good
As it looks now good condition
With the 500,000 I saved and another 300,000 waiting for me in the next three years, there is no reason I will not be a millionaire for another three or four years
I also save in addition to that
Some?
I have espp which is 10% of the salary on which I get 15% then 11.5% which is 16 thousand
And another 18,000 in pension provisions
That along with what Apple puts it is even more, something like 24
So 40 thousand, that means another 120 in three years
So a total of 420 thousand
I also expect the market to rise at this time
Although now I do not know how much it will cost
He looks pretty inflated
It is impossible to know, but I guess it will not rise as it has risen so far
So overall I expect to be worth over 900 thousand in another three years
And it makes sense to be in a million years bro
But that means another 4 years, not 3
How much can I expect the market to do?
The market has made 16% in the last year
There is a situation where next year will do nothing
A year ago he made 4%
And before 16%
Hard to know
Many also fear a recession
In short do not know what will be
If I assume an average of 8%
And in the last three years there has been an average of 12% I think in the next three very possible an average of 4%
That means 12% total
That it&#39;s supposed to get me to a million
With God&#39;s help
That still means working 3 years
That&#39;s fine
But it&#39;s still three four years
About 50 months
Maybe 40 and a bit
I will probably work until the age of forty at least
I guess at some point I will start to feel less stressed from work
Even now I&#39;m a little less stressed
Now I should be able to make 40,000 of the money I have
Or a little over 3,000 a month
That&#39;s enough to hold me
In total, I built on half a million shekels
So that I can live on 3,000 shekels a month
I now have 3.5 times that
That&#39;s great
But not yet free
I&#39;m just afraid that Sheeran will not find a job
Hence a prenuptial agreement
Good
What more
If not a financial agreement I guess we will split it all between the two of us and I will have half a million left for another three four years
That it&#39;s not terrible
But on that there are also the children
Q If we earn the same I do not know how much I will have to pay
It&#39;s by child custody time for sure
If it&#39;s half and half then probably nothing
But assuming 25% it means I will have to pay for the second part
Do not really know how it works
But if this child spends 3000 two children let&#39;s say 6000 I provide them with support a quarter of the time, I&#39;ll probably have to provide another quarter for the rest of the time
It&#39;s 1500 a month
That it&#39;s half of what I do out of the half a million I have left
I do not think they will take from me twice but it is impossible to know
I guess that would be half of it
That it&#39;s a basa
But not terrible
I&#39;ll have to keep working
Three more four two sure
Anyway
It still hasn’t closed me the corner of the three four years until then

Well what else?
Not too much
I still do not have too much energy


I want to know when I can retire
By and large I get 1300 from ESPP and 1300 from 401k and 1300 in RSUs (or 20k a year before tax)
So that pretty much closes the 4000 for me in a month of savings
I can add another 500 or even 1000 here if I live in a more normal place


According to the standard deviation and expectation of this profit came out between 8-12 years

Work as hard as you want
So I need to find an apartment
As if an investment house
I looked at 70 homes today
I think the question I chose looks round
But it&#39;s hard to know

It&#39;s a coincidence that Kelly from Google broke my heart that day Kelly (Lisa) broke my heart
Like what&#39;s the chance of that happening that day?
How many times in my life have my heart been broken like that
In the last ten years this has not happened
And what is the chance that a company will break my heart
The last time I tried to get accepted to a company like this it was to Google and that was about five years ago
So what is the chance that something with a frequency of once every five years and ten years will happen on the same day?
It&#39;s 1 for 365 * 10 * 5 * 365 or 1 for over 50 million
And what is the chance that they both have the same name?
Well it&#39;s not exactly the same name
But it&#39;s a variation of the same name
Suppose the similarity between the names is
kallie
Kelly
It&#39;s a resemblance of 3 letters out of 5 at least, and that&#39;s the important letters too, but suppose a resemblance of 60%
From how many names are there
What is the frequency of this name?
The most common name with such a resemblance is kayla
And that&#39;s 155,000 out of 20 million (for the 90s age group, which I guess they were both born in)
It&#39;s one in 130
Total 1 to 16 thousand
Making the probability of this event one to about 800 billion
Really low chance
Almost one in a trillion
Obviously this could be coincidental
But in reviving one in a trillion
That&#39;s pretty crazy
It does not seem to me that I have had a more rare coincidence than this
I told this to a psychologist
She was not impressed
She is very meter of fact
Good
What else?
Do not know
I was trying to figure out what the feelings were in Vipassana
Let&#39;s look again
They say it&#39;s just the noise barrier level goes down (noise gate) and then you feel feelings that are usually filtered as noise
that make sense
That&#39;s also what I think
Good
What else?
Do not know
It was nice today with the Israeli company
We were in a house of leeks
June contacted someone who lives with the leek what the shark plan is
What part of
And we jumped in to say hello
What a house
huge house
Heated pool
Really impressive
Good
The walk was nice too
This Ionic man is interesting
Nir, too
With his Nir Det Experience

I got a little tired
But that&#39;s a good thing
Excellent even

What about you?
Do not know
Everything is fine
Still upset
But what can be done
Probably with time it will fade
this is life
Semc
The truth is I was with longer hair when she liked me
Maybe I&#39;ll get back to that
Oops
What does it matter
Another guy like that will come and do this to her and this is another break
Although women are often locked up
So why not me?
Of what he did to her
I was dying to be a girl just to see how he was
Maybe the people had such a filter that makes you a daughter
There is such a filter
I can also put on a wig
But I&#39;m not going to shave for it
Good
so what are we doing?
Maybe I can pay some daughter to do it
I&#39;m obsessed
I need to let go
There are many fish in the sea
This is a section where the heart is locked
Maybe we are monogamous
But only up to the baby
Then the baby is what continues the monogamy
Maybe
Good
What else?
I&#39;m pissed off about Google
As if one pain feeds the other pain
Because every time I remember one and try to release from it the other comes up
In short without Google I am stuck in this job that I do not feel I am contributing enough
I hope I do well in the interesting project
I hope maybe they will let work on it full time
we will see what will be
From what I understood after Sky it should already be more a matter of features and less of a platform
So hope it gets better
And if I do not ask to pass
Everything is fine
Maybe I&#39;ll really try to get into finance

We will go to sleep…



Well then what am I actually recording all let&#39;s start with this Inter Red line Enter. A linebreak
I do not know so much
So what and that

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
What about you?
Sabba
First working day
Was pretty tough
I still have a lot to do in my citizenship
Things need to close with the House in Alabama
what else?
Ashley
Let&#39;s close it now
closed down…
Oops
It was hopeless
But the one that was a chance, she&#39;s so beautiful
I would give up a lot for her
Good
psychologist?
Good
what else?
Lawyer
We have a conversation on Wednesday
As for the apartment, I have nothing to do
If he pays the deposit, I stop advertising the house
I have so little to say to the other
I can wait a couple of days to see what Quintin says
Good
What else?
What else?
Do not know
No more work from the office any time soon
I really hope the vaccine arrives already
I can still go to work once in a while
Once a month a spin
That is, what except?
Do not know whether to move instead of Sheeran
Not critical at the moment
Although it bothers me when she prepares food
I do not know what to do
One can wait with that for January
I have to do with these Deep Dave once a quarter
Good
What about reading?
I need to read a wonderful new world
Good
What about the guy Jonathan&#39;s book recommended?
Please nice narf
But this is the weak link between the things I have to do
What more?
Do not know
I did quite a lot I feel
What now?
So we said:
Poker and chess
Guitar and vocals
Palms and dancing
Book?
Study for interviews?


Hey
what&#39;s going on?
All is well
What about you?
Sabba
What are you telling?
Not too much
Had the Apple event, they did not announce a new iPhone
Will probably announce later this year
I was with Ashley all morning
She&#39;s probably not from Russia
Probably something near
Maybe one of the stans
Maybe Eastern Europe
Was nice but now i have egg pain
I hope she has too
I&#39;m trying too hard for her
Probably after sex I got off
Although we kind of had sex
Do not know
And now she does not want to do it anymore
She feels bad about it
Like a whore or something
Too bad
As if for me there is not so much a problem with prostitution
But women have a problem
It&#39;s something in culture I guess
I&#39;m ashamed I didn &#39;t see her tit
And that I did not take advantage of it anymore that she did it
I&#39;m fine
With only to bring in hand in front of her
She loves it it seems to me
Maybe she&#39;s just flirting with me
But I think I have a good radar for good people
And she looks like a good guy
It seems to me that I would give up Sheeran for her
It does not seem so logical now
But maybe if she leaves me a way to contact her I can somehow send her money or maybe fly to her
I do not know how I will fly to her
Because of the plague
If there had not been an epidemic I might have said it was for a conference
Good
Another vision for the date
See if you&#39;ll leave me a way to contact her at all

I spoke with Sheeran yesterday about the financial agreement
She seems to be more open to it now
She claims she sacrificed her career for me
It&#39;s a little annoying
I did not ask you to sacrifice for me
The opposite if I remember correctly I asked her a thousand times if she&#39;s sure it&#39;s okay and I do not want her to blame me for anything if we do
But Sabba is the sacrifice
How much is this sacrifice worth
According to the calculation I made, it is around 200,000
Should it just fall on me or split between us?
I think it&#39;s not my fault
But a spin let’s say we split
It&#39;s 100,000
I have no problem putting 200,000 in a joint account
And continue with us our division that we both put aside half for both of us and the rest of each
I think the fair distribution is a quarter
A quarter of income and a quarter of capital
At most
Why
A quarter of the income is what she gets now
That&#39;s what we live for
A quarter of the capital, because let&#39;s say I&#39;m retiring
If she receives half of the capital, she actually receives half of my income and above that another quarter of the income is already 75%
It&#39;s not fair
So a quarter of the capital is a quarter of the income and in addition a quarter of the income is exactly half
Except that if she earns half of what I earn it will be the division anyway
It&#39;s shorter
Good
What else?
Sabba
I feel pretty good about the way I run this event
we will see what will be
Beauty
What about work
Work fine
It seems to me I have reached a milestone in two of the things I need to do
Tomorrow I need to talk to the Japanese guy to see if he can provide me with a list of names
Will shorten processes for me

So what does the project need?
It will be possible for 10 people at a time
I mean there will be a queue or something
Or speed up individual use with another api

Sela wants to move to Colorado
Bummer
what can we do
Interesting guy
I wonder if his project will work

What else do I need?

Bassa that takes a long time
It is possible like those who turn a file into something else
Who simply email the result

You can give the option

Is it critical for likes?

I will get the most likes if it is instant
I can make it more immediate if I use harassment

The majority will probably write one sentence

Why would I use it
If there is anything I do not have the strength to read on Wikipedia, I would use it


It should be faster
The bug needs to be fixed
More than one person should be allowed
Need more than five videos a day

Put the thoughts in the box

So what do you want

what would you like to do
I would like to break your hand
Then give you mercy

If I had a million dollars
I was…

Do not know

I would travel the world?

What did I do while hiking?
I went to see beautiful places
But come on, I feel the Internet is enough for me
What is the most beautiful place I have been?
The toruses
And is that the best thing I did?
What is the best thing I did?
sex
Baside that
Smoking
What experience do I remember best?
The drop?

jerusalem post
I do not know why I have this word in my head

What I enjoy
From the retarded game candy saga
From the sites reddit and facebook
Why?
Do not know, the game is a challenging ball to an extent
Bardit and Facebook have beautiful things


I want to avoid Facebook and Reddit
I go there because it&#39;s the least energy
My brain needs input so as not to get bored
Which input is better than Facebook and Reddit?
On Facebook I usually read about politics and economics
Sometimes there are funny things too
Berdit is news from around the world
Interesting Stuff
Funny things
I can look at what I did like
And try to find a way to get straight to the source

In essence this is the symptom and not the problem
I just have no more interesting input

How do you explain games
Where there is also an output and still people prefer the games
Maybe I should do a gamification for the things I really want to do
What makes something a game?
What games do I like?
Suppose Candy Crush is addictive
Why?
Civilization I really liked
Why?
There is a purpose
There are not very complicated and not too simple steps to reach the goal


I want a good place for all my lists

Assumptions:
The particle fits through the doorway with epsilon degrees wiggle room
This means that the probability that a particle that approaches the (center of the) doorway crosses it is (without the door itself), is epsilon/180
The door opens up to 90 degrees to one side only.
The door’s mass is negligible (does not change the course of the particle).

The probability to cross with the direction of the door:

Say there’s epsilon degree in which the ball can pass then the probability of a particle, that goes towards the door, to pass is epsilon/180 (probability that the ball is heading the right direction)

The probability to cross against the direction of the door:

Say there’s epsilon degree in which the ball can pass then the probability of a particle, that goes towards the door, to pass is epsilon/90 (probability that the door is sufficiently open) times epsilon/180 (probability  that the ball is heading the right direction)

In total there’s 90/epsilon times more chance that a particle will cross with the direction of the door than against it.
Inclusion and induction in the brain:
Generalization - When several neurons shoot together into the same neuron, the phenomenon is integrated into the same neuron, for example a neuron that symbolizes an auto-shot when it detects four wheels and a body, a neuron (or neurons) four wheels and a body neuron are integrated into one neuron
Induction - when we see only four wheels we will include in the car we will imagine that there is a body, even though the body&#39;s neuron did not fire at all
This is enough for the level of computation of a Turing machine (or Mada calculation)
Anyone with a brain can generalize and do induction (requires only 2 layers)

Why not just settle for what is there
Once I have a million dollars
By and large this is it
I finished my debt to the company

Let&#39;s see what the psychologist will say
Good

A friend of Liad said that blacks and Mexicans study better because they have stopped dealing with the social, so they deal more with the study material.
So it&#39;s really someone who looks better, learns less
And women look better so they do not have to learn much
segment
Why are blacks and Hispanics more social?
Is it genetic?
The size of the bulbul?
More horny?
There is a situation
segment
Or maybe they just do not see what is happening to others
Then they do not compare themselves and get mad that they are not doing well
As with that gifted people who go to gifted school are less successful because they feel less equal relative to the population there
We are also more difficult with ourselves in failure than happy in success
It&#39;s a basa
That means it&#39;s harder to be happy
it&#39;s not fair
So on average we are not happy

intelligence
The whole brain thinks the same way, in patterns of time space, all the senses simply perceive changes in the environment and transmit them through the nerves, if it is light, then there is a nerve that perceives if there is more or less light, if it is a sound then there is a nerve that perceives the frequency of the sound, if It&#39;s the amount of food in the stomach that affects hunger, it&#39;s all patterns of changes in space and time, and patterns linked to each other, cat input will be characterized by pointed ears, &quot;meow&quot; sound and even without feeling it we will know its fur is pleasant to caress, but the basis of all is patterns of changes in space Time, there is always a transfer of information (we often ignore, the changes are the ones that usually catch the attention
These patterns are stored in memory but in a special way,
The memory is preserved in a certain sequence, it is not possible to see an overall picture straight, it is only possible to remember in the process, like a song, a character, a detail, every time a concept
Memory completes patterns, it receives information and completes it on its own, according to the input
What matters in the resulting patterns, is not the exact input but the relationship between the inputs, when we identify a person, we not only recognize that he has eyes and nose, we also recognize the distance between the eyes Proportion, and even if we look at him from a different light we will notice it is the same person,
Intelligence is the predictive ability of the brain, the ability to self-complete the received pattern, the brain constantly completes patterns of its input, and tries to predict from past memory the continuation of the input, what it is supposed to absorb, meaningful thinking is obtained only when there is a deviation from the desired pattern. Humor is built, for example, as soon as we get out of the routine line of thought, surprise makes us laugh, as a kind of recognition of the excitement we experienced), in us memory also controls behavior, behavior is a result of our prediction of what is supposed to happen, first we imagine the action.
Cortex action

The cortex consists of six layers, which information runs up and down, it rises upwards, and sifts the treatment, in order to reach maximum analysis, and in addition it goes down in the form of feedback, to predict its expectation, completion of the current pattern, and thus checks itself, if anything new , If there is something to learn, or where the situation is clear and familiar, the ahmash can also descend down the locomotor regions of the cortex and thus order an action appropriate to the current pattern.
Each region in the cortex works in pretty much the same way, it recognizes the pattern in the current input and passes it on, while sifting through the less important details, for each pattern or series, a group of organs it retains or gives a name, which it passes on
The hierarchy in the cortex represents the world, logic is in fact induction and deduction, understanding the pattern, or the relationship between things, building a whole from parts, and deduction, separating the whole into its parts, understanding about an individual from the whole

In the lower layer, all the input comes directly from the receptors, the nerves, ie the senses, when there are inputs that often come together, they continue on together to the next layer, and a generalization is formed between them, the next time only some of the inputs are supposed to appear together, the cortex already knew to complete the picture. And every time these inputs appear again and again together, the connections are strengthened, and our predictive power increases, grouping inputs together is actually giving a name or conceptualization of a phenomenon, as for example connecting input of stem with leaves gives the concept of wood, or connection of sound tax gives the concept Tune, once the prediction is wrong, it is necessary to investigate the matter, break it down into components or look for different patterns
The action is part of thinking, it is simply continuing processing through the nerves related to the position of the body at any given moment, for example when in the corner of the eye we have a feeling of bone growing rapidly i.e. approaching, instinctively defending ourselves from this direction because we already know the pattern. Quickly, it will probably hurt, but even non-instinctive stunts work similarly
The Gestalt, the sense of reaching a conclusion stems from the moment when the appropriate pattern for the given input is found, when as in a puzzle everything settles in place
Learning is done so that at each stage the processing is done at the lower levels of the cortex, for example speech, first syllable separation is the main occupation of the cortex, then word separation, word imitation, sentence construction, etc., so in adulthood, syllable separation is done with almost input.
The short-term memory, the new memory, is in the hippocampus, when there is input that does not fit into any template, oh is stored in the hippocampus for immediate use, but if it is not needed, it will be lost as soon as such new information arrives
The thalamus receives the information that needs to be focused on at that moment

Intelligence is actually the ability to predict and remember and it has existed since the dawn of life, as the basic operation of the cell, which is separated from the outside, but receives information from it and uses it (for reproduction, for food ...)
The next step was the ability to change the predictive and memory abilities during life, which means that it is not only a genetic charge but is also affected by the environment.
The last ability is the ability to create concepts, or names as a substitute for direct learning, this is the mediation known to certain species of animals, but performed in a much stronger way in humans
Creativity is openness to patterns, meaning a repeated attempt to understand or challenge existing patterns, when we are not committed to the pattern, we do not work in stereotypes and are able to come up with a completely new approach to sustain
Awareness is actually the total declarative memories, conceptualized in us, that is, things we can talk about, if we erase a person&#39;s memory of a particular day, that is, return his mind to the exact state he was in the day before, then he will be sure that the past day did not exist at all. For he was unaware of his deeds the day before, though when he had done them he was fully aware of it,
Consciousness is the ability to concentrate or tune in to certain things, free will
Imagination is the patterns we create in our heads, even when there is no complete picture we are able to complete it in our imagination, and when we only think of a certain concept we are able to go into it in great detail as if it existed
I want my own office
But he will have to be able to do the rest with everyone else




If I really manage to do 0.2% per day, or 4% per month, or 60% per year, I for 60k I only need 100k that I have, so in total I&#39;m done.
I wish.
But what are the chances that it really works?

Well I&#39;m doing an experiment this week
we will see what will be

If it works?
Once I have Green Karen I take some year off, figure out what I want


Sheeran: How many toasts do you want?
Sheeran: How many toasts do you want?
Sheeran: How many toasts do you want?
Jordan raises three fingers
Sheeran: I&#39;ll push you in the ass
Jordan removes two of the fingers

Sheeran: There should be less pretzels and more chocolate here
Jordan: What is pretzels anyway, who eats pretzels?
Sheeran: What have you never eaten a bagel?
Jordan: Pretzels are not pretzels
Sheeran: That&#39;s right

Jordan: I want to hug you and kiss you and throw you out the window
Sheeran: * shakes her head *
Jordan: What not? You can point me to exactly which of the things is wrong
Sheeran: * points to Jordan *

Sheeran: * licks a knife sensually and looks with an inviting look *
Sheeran: * starts doing deep throat with the knife *

Sheeran: The mice are pooping outside the door, and it&#39;s really big
Jordan: Maybe we&#39;ll be shit there too, and then they&#39;ll see ours have bigger poop and be scared

After six days: Wanting to go to the movies, I bought tickets to the Titanic
After six years: wanting to smell my hand, I pushed her ass

Girl coming out of the bathroom: Dad! You will not believe what was there on the chair


How much hair she had
Her whole body was hair

Me: Love is blind
Sheeran: Too bad love is not permissive

You know he’s a Cheeto 
Her: I can’t believe it, you’re such a Cheeto 
Him (a Cheeto): yo



There is no computer that can smelt itself, because then it had to smelt itself as well
It just proves there is no God
For if God is what smelt all that is applicable and God is there then God smelt also himself, otherwise God is not
A kind of paradox
It can be solved if God is outside the universe

Can God create a stone that he cannot lift?
Does this not contradict the fact that God is omnipotent?
Maybe this is a problem with the word
It may be that this is simply not the definition of God, and that God is not omnipotent as we define omnipotent

Can God be above logic?




 
I should try to anticipate the outcome, make cases and reactions

I tried to give the free qr to 10 restaurants
Only 5 took
Only 1 really put it on the tables

I spend way too much money

I do not know how to proceed from here
I still believe in the idea
I can try to go to 100 places
So that 10 apply the qr
I can try to post on Facebook / Google
I need an ad
I need an explanatory video
But an explanatory video costs thousands of dollars
I do not know if I want to invest such a sum

For 100 restaurants I need 50 prints of ten qrs
It comes out to about $ 500-1000

I was happy to start writing it all in
One can only think ahead

In short, &quot;what to do&quot; is a question
I&#39;m pissed at the agent who just cut me
I can either go for it with another agent
Or look for another realtor

On the one hand, he deserves compensation for all the time he spent with me
I can send him some gift card or something

Oops it&#39;s holding me back in about a month or two

so what to do?
I need to take care of the open tabs
Treat those that have become bookmarks
I have a lot of other things in Asana
I do not even know if to continue using it
And I did not even talk about the work I still have to do
But it&#39;s not for now
Or so
I did not read from the reading list
I always give it up
There are more things I want to read than I pay to read

What a mess
There are two things that interest me
Of money
And computational learning

So what else do I have to do?
Miles?


claim:
Or you can think of it as Buffett
Or you can do any startup
proof:
Buffett argues that one can understand enough about a particular subject to know how to invest in it
If this is not true, then it is impossible to identify a good start-up in which to invest anything understanding in the field
Understanding in the field! -&gt; Startup identification
Otherwise - there is no priority for a good idea -&gt; You can make any idea

Basically every business has cash flow, so you can check the price of the company according to which and according to the interest rate less the growth


Test
animals:
live
move

living creature:
metabolism
reproduction (with mutation)

So I find a place with a ten percent rent dividend
Name Name 100000
Gets 10,000 a year
Two years later I can bring another apartment like this
Two years later I had another one and basically I finished
Then it&#39;s a passive income of 30,000
Along with the work it&#39;s 75000 it means that a year and a bit later I have a passive income of 40,000
Maybe 30,000 after tax
After another year it&#39;s 85000
It comes out 4 years to a minimum
Five and a half to 40,000
7 to 50,000
8 to 60,000
Spend 7 enough, 8 brings in 20000 gross, which is a lot
Here we spend about 60,000 a year, 5 a month
And it&#39;s a turn

How do I find an apartment
I need to understand a little bit about real estate
Maybe need a course
Or I go to some company and ask there
They have some interest
But I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a problem
I need to search the internet



Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Why a new document?
Do not know
So what
Let&#39;s do an experiment
Ask yourself 7 questions why
Why do I feel this way?
Because I was born that way?
Why was I born that way?
Because my parents gave birth to me like that
Why did they do it?
What does it matter?

I will ask my son what he prefers, three years of high school or four months course and then work ahead
There will be resistance
So part time
But it is forbidden to work at this age
Why?
Do not know
Shall we move on to speech?
By and large I do a year ~ 150k
One-third taxes
A third of expenses
One-third savings

20 from RSU before tax, assume it is 13.5 after tax
And 130 salary
In salary I get 5 every two weeks
Of these, 1.5 taxes
.5 on ESPP
.3 about 401k
Apple doubles that for me
So I save 1.1 every two weeks that year it&#39;s 13 and it&#39;s supposedly after tax
In the end I have about 2.6 left in my pocket, that&#39;s about 66 a year, 5.5 a month
Expenses are supposed to be 4 a month, but come out 5
Maybe it&#39;s going to get better as we move

What is my problem?
I feel I could do better.
Like get someone better, thinner, prettier, cleaner, less lazy,
But I think I’ll have the same issues with that person.
Everyone has issues.
I have been with many girls, and she is the one I’m most attracted to. That’s not to say I could find someone I’m more attractants to.
I still need something else.
I don’t know why that is
Might be related to the fact that I am a man, and I have this in my brain.
I can go to strippers. I tried that and didn’t like that.
I can invite escorts. I tried that and liked it, but it’s expensive here.
1000$~ for an hour.
Well, I’m not sure that’s worth it.
In Israel you can get for a third of that.
If the price is the issue, it shouldn’t be.
It’s just that I think, maybe I should donate to charity instead.
But I do think that taxes are kind of charity.
I’m giving more than I’m taking from the government.
I might take more when I’m older. So I’m actually also donating to myself in the future.
The government also holds an army, so not all is donation. I probably need to calculate.
Say I give 25% to the government. A third of that goes to health. But half of that goes to retirement, so actually 6% is a donation.
There’s also state taxes, which go to education and health as well, but I counted them in the 25%.
So I should probably donate like 5% more.
But to what?
I should devote some resources for the greater good.
Though the happiness maximization doesn’t align with that. Actually, if it makes me feel good it does.
So what cause should I focus on? I should think in suffering minimization terms, or maybe in saving lives or time for people. 
I can cheer people up with music generation. Make them forget the pain of existence.
So I can donate time for that. What about money? 
5% is ~300$

Sentence:
Under a sheet with blocked derivatives function with a number of minimums, when the number of steps tends to infinity, convergence (maybe in the span maybe not?) To the global minimum

This step is derived or minus the derivative (with a probability of 50 percent)
When the step length is the maximum between changes of direction
(This change is a derivative that is magical)


Under a sheet with blocked derivatives, a function with a number of minimums, when the number of steps tends to infinity, a convergence (maybe in the span maybe not?) To the global minimum
This step is derived or minus the derivative (with a probability of 50 percent)
When the step length is the maximum between changes of direction (change of direction seems to me to be the distance between a minimum and a nearby local maximum)
That sounds right doesn&#39;t it?


I want to check if this is true and not stupid
It may extend the ability to do Gradient Descent to non-convex functions as well

This integral is average
g(x) = (f(x)-f(x+h))/h
f(x) = g(x)*h+f(x+h)=g(x)*h+g(x+h)*h+f(x+2h)=

(x ^ 2- (x + h) ^ 2) / h = -2x-h

x^2=-2xh-h^2-2(x+h)h-h^2+(x+2h)^2

How can I contribute?
Fun ML project
Computer generated music

A program to study for an interview from Machine Lerning
Five sites
Every day solve a question
Repeat Andrew&#39;s courses

There are between 100 and 1000 computational learning questions, and between 10 and 100 language processing questions
How many questions to ask?
I have 4 weeks and Christmas
What will I do at Christmas?
When will I go on holiday after Christmas?
Maybe around April for a week

One question each day will amount to 4 weeks * 5 days, 20 questions
You have to ask 5 questions a day to reach 100
Each question 20 d, that means ~ two hours a day
Or you can do a few questions per hour
That should be enough
It&#39;s 20 hours
3 weeks for computational learning and last week for language processing
Besides doing Andrew&#39;s preparatory course
It&#39;s 10 weeks, every week five hours, I can do a lesson on a busy day, or two days, or just an hour a day and then it will really take 10 weeks.

What about my project?
Is more important
Need to keep working on it
But how much more?
At the moment he is not really giving results
Although there seems to be something there
It is not yet entirely clear
There is still a lot of work to be done
The question is how much work to put into it
I also have the option to identify good stocks using xgboost
There is also an option to go through a project
I just have to decide when it&#39;s enough

So for Andrew&#39;s course, if I want to finish by the end of the year, I have to give 50 hours in 4 weeks.
That means 12 hours a week, that&#39;s 3 hours 4 times,
I have to finish two and a half weeks a week, that&#39;s a lot
What about the project then…
I can postpone it for a month…

But I have to decide when enough
I have invested in this project full time, if all the attempts before (of deepmoney) are included

What do I do with all the emails?
What about all the bookmarks?
What about the tasks?

I need to think of potential benefit
On the one hand I waste time
On the other hand, what will I do at this time?
With all the planning I have already closed next year

I have 3 things to do a day, 21 a week, half (10) I work, another 5 I work on my stuff, another 5 for Sheeran.
I do not have such free time.
You can change it to 3 for work on things, 3 for free and 4 for Sheeran

I go through the emails every day on the return trip, I also need to start reading an article
I need to clear the tasks as well

What to clean?
This job is a list of tasks, radars, emails and bookmarks
This house has a to-do list, asana tasks, emails and bookmarks

In short, everything should be in one place
Probably in something like radar or asana
The problem is that I do not have a component of my own on the radar, my private tasks have no place
Vasana is also not a tool either,
The emails should become tasks, the bookmarks I try to read once a day… one private one of the work
The problem is that emails usually have something to read before I get to it
Private tasks should also aspire to be in project management tools
I can give Jira a chance I guess, but I do not think it will completely replace, neither the emails nor the tasks nor the bookmarks…


I don't know what I want
I do not know what I want
This is madness

I hope these two percent will be enough to make me a millionaire in a year, so I can concentrate on producing artificial intelligence.

Power
Feeling / desire / trust / disgust
Self / external
Towards someone / something / event
Physical / emotional / mental level

Is desire a feeling?
What is the difference between hatred and disgust? Is it like the difference between bread and runaway?
So what is the difference between disgust and fear? Both encourage an escape response. Can fear cause disgust or hatred?
Maybe disgust is just a basic emotion. Maybe it&#39;s fear on a physical level. Or in general a negative feeling on the physical level.
Is not this fear on a physical level?
Perhaps this desire is on the high mental level
Is trust a feeling?
Maybe security - lack of fear
What is jealousy? Desire for exclusivity
Even mistrust of someone creates jealousy

What to do:

Options:
Analyze previous year schedule + plan this year’s schedule
Analyze failures in deepmoney3

What&#39;s going on?
All is well
What&#39;s new?
Not too much
I pretty much got what I needed at work
This is a milestone
But what else?
What about life itself?
Maybe I should just submit a client to Naorlink
It would be cool to work there
Probably less money
I need to read the article
I find it hard to believe that a neuron would really need to be connected
I think if we can connect to Corpus Closus it will be enough
Just add another brain
Good
What else?
I do not know what I want
Maybe play on the computer

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
We arrived in Cancun
That&#39;s all right
We are in a room with two small beds and a view of the garden
You can move to a larger bed or a view of the sea but to both
Question will be my troubles
We&#39;ll go to the sea today
What else?
Not too much
Sitting at sea
In the sun that remained
I forgot that the sun is setting in the other direction
So it&#39;s almost over
But nice that in the room we have a sunset
This
Yaron once again won chess
Well it&#39;s good
Challenges me
Like Haifa it&#39;s like San Francisco
And Tel Aviv as to LA
Jerusalem is Vegas
Their name is God


I need to concentrate the money

[] From investments in Israel - 12k - call Leumi Call to make a transfer

[] From Mellanox - 10k - release via esop

[] Pension in Israel - find out about tax

[] Esperange - 7k - Release after receiving an answer regarding profit sharing

Profit sharing - waiting for an answer from Benjamin

[] Pension in France - ask Remy

[ ]    עו״ש בארה״ב - 15 

[ ]    ESPP - 10k 

US Pension - Find Out About Taxes



And invest everything in stocks and bonds
What&#39;s going on?
everything is good how are you?
Sabba, so what do you say?
Not too much, I&#39;m working on automatic transliteration. It&#39;s nice, but much harder than I expected.
I&#39;m just trying to think how hard it would be to do harder things of text production.
Like speech for example.
I wonder how the winner of the Turing competition works.
AIML
And there is also this:

With 6k stars in GitHub
But it&#39;s rule based rules

What about trading software



I can use it instead
Maybe it&#39;s worth trying Zipline

Come on
What more
The weekend is over
Feels like I did not do much
I was at a social event and then in the park from noon to evening
Yesterday we were at sea, we also came back quite late, and I went to bed early

I more think what to do artificial
Yesterday morning I did nothing
I may need to take time to think about what to do

What do I have to do?
There are emails
Tabs open
Bookmarks
Asana / Spreadsheet

By and large I am traveling from work reading an email, and a bookmark
And during the week I&#39;m supposed to do things from Asana, or the issue
I was happy to make an app from the issue
It should be pretty simple
The question is whether I want to invest in it

Also do not know in which project to invest
I then did an analysis of the possibilities and it seems to me that the most logical is in language processing
Because it&#39;s the most interesting
And there is profitable potential
But stocks are also quite interesting
Also real estate

Language processing but also helps me at work
And learning it will help me in other areas as well
I need to do long-term planning
Where I want to be a year from now even five years from now
How much effort I give to everything
Five years from now I wish I was free, with ten duplexes each making $ 500 a month
Is this the best case scenario?
Perhaps the best case scenario is to open up a language processing startup.
Or being in a startup as a chief computational researcher or engineer, and having the startup bring me a lot of money
It seems to me that I would have preferred the startup to be mine
Maybe both?

Grandma Doll passed away
that&#39;s sad
It all happens together maybe it&#39;s like taking off a band-aid
It is better that everything happens in Mecca
Maybe
I need to do some language model on Grandma
Maybe it&#39;s possible to predict her speech somehow
Can be nice to be able to talk to her
Or concentrate on raising your brain to the cloud so we do not need this thing
Maybe
Good
So how do you concentrate on that?
If I were the one to decide, I would try to go for the area responsible for abstract thinking, the frontal lobe.
Trying to add more neurons there to see if it improves thought
But I guess to get there you need the whole base of hardware
I can submit a client to Naorlink
Why not actually
Good
What else?
I feel a little out of place at work
It sucks, I was really happy to start in a new place
Especially on Google
My good results are not really impressive now that there is another way to get to them
As if I had not really donated anything
so what are we doing?
I have to dig into mistakes a bit to see where this is coming from
Maybe there&#39;s some problem with the laws
I&#39;m happy about this project
I hope to finish with the project they dropped on me
I think if they ask for more than that, I&#39;ll turn it over to someone else
It sucks to have two girlfriends with so much motivation, they make me look bad
What can I do?
I do not have too many options
The part of computational learning brought someone else to do
It sucks a little
In the next quarter I might be able to do the experiment at least to see if the domain can be delivered using Morphen
Can be interesting
Good
What else?
Maybe I should develop ties out?
I&#39;m not good at it it seems to me
Maybe I should study for a degree
Maybe
With the help of the name, I will be free for another three years
With God&#39;s help
Good
What else?
I can send a client to the finance company
Okay
What more?
Fucking Lisa
I probably need to break away from her
It probably just misleads me
I probably deserve it
But I do not think I control it
If I could I would just stop what I was feeling
But it&#39;s not easy
There are other really beautiful girls who can replace her in my life
There is no prohibition in the Torah on polygamy
There is a prohibition in the law
But the law is wrong, it has to be a person&#39;s decision
As long as I do not harm anyone it is my right
Then the question arises
What about drunk driving?
In principle, there is also no law that prohibits aiming a weapon at another person
The law says do not kill, you drove drunk and killed someone so you will be punished
You drove drunk and were caught driving irresponsibly,
There is a situation that needs to be considered risk
When you drive drunk you are a danger
So where&#39;s the limit
Apparently the border as in everything is pretty gray
As long as the risk to the environment does not increase there is no need to ban the law
As the risk increases so does enforcement
So where does the line go?
One in a million risk? One in a thousand? One in ten?
Probably one in a million does not, probably one in ten does
One in a thousand is probably the border area
Maybe need a more practical approach
If a particular law does not reduce the risk then it is unnecessary
If it decreases really slightly?
Depends on how much freedom versus how much risk maybe
tough question
Much easier when it&#39;s just black and white
But life is probably not like that
Maybe you don&#39;t need rules
Maybe just always let a group of people decide…
Maybe let the machine decide
Maybe
Good
How did I get here?
Lisa
I thought maybe add her to have more than one wife
I&#39;m hitting Sheeran here
But what about hurting me
So maybe this is the trade off
Hurting me versus hurting others
How much violation of freedom is worth?
Absolute violation of freedom is death
Impairing my ability to have sex with others just so that her feelings do not hurt is already more complicated
If she does not know emotions are not harmed
Suppose she knows, I can ask what she prefers, I will go or I will stay but I will have relationships with others
Anyway it probably won&#39;t be with Lisa
Unfortunately
Do not know what happened there
I&#39;m almost sure she was really interested in me
But she never behaved the way she did with that one
I&#39;m so dying to know what was there
I have to ask someone who has been with him
Good
What else?
Do not know
Maybe mostly wait
Good
Maybe we&#39;ll see Kernel&#39;s lecture
Good



What am I doing?
I need to prepare to the interview
I want to keep going with the project
Options:
Learn statistics on Khan academy
Do NLP interview questions 
Work on project
Investigate failures


What else?
Still need to wait those 6 years…
Damn
6 frickin years…
I have to take advantage of the time…
How?
What do you want to do?
Sex, drugs…
What else?
What do you enjoy?
No idea ...
Fly?
You tell me

What do I do 6 years now?
Soon we might have a baby, so there goes my free time…
For 5 years…


At 25 I am at my peak
At 75 I am nothing
Probably a linear decrease
Every five to twelve percent
10* 10 =100
So now I&#39;m about 80 percent
From the age of 40 onwards I am less than 70 percent
It&#39;s still a lot
But on average it is 35 percent
For how long?
40 years
What is the alternative?
Be content while I have half of the half, a quarter of the time
Or half the time in the future
One can mathematically calculate who is right
Leaves it as proof to the reader

I need to do a roast me with a fake account
Berdit

I considered both sides, what is the chance that what one side wants is simply its relative share
And the other side wants as much as possible

Tell Sheeran that if she wants to know what I did, tell her what she wants to know
But she must not just say otherwise I do not trust her at all anymore

The calculation
At 40 I am about 70%?
Then I have 40 years of seventy percent
Instead of retiring at sixty-five, with some on the side?
Or set aside

The calculation is as follows
Live on half to forty then forty forever live on half forty
But utilize instead of a quarter of life utilize at least half
It&#39;s twice as much
So I lose half and win twice as much
It&#39;s offset
So from the age of 40 I live fifty percent?
Otherwise all my life I live a quarter

I can now live a quarter of the time according to two of the half I live on now (which is 1)
And so forever
Or another five or four years to live on half the time, with half
Totally the same, only two now suffer and live five years on half of what I can
It&#39;s only worth it if I can do it now
Is there a situation I was wrong?
So by mathematical logic I&#39;m making a mistake?
sailing
Now is a more important time than that
But happiness is not determined linearly with income, until the average income it rises one by one, then after the average it does not rise much
It is difficult to quantify
So come on I did not come to a conclusion
There is a situation that cannot be concluded here

Good
what do you want?
Do not know
What about you?
So what angle?
Also need to set
Some say it does not cost more than a hundred thousand
So what does it matter
This is quite a scientific proof
But relies on sociological research
Do not know if you trust them
Good
What else?

Everything is a metaphor
Like a fractal
It&#39;s all an imagination of something to itself


I write a lot
But does not read
How do I make it readable?
Impress only what is important
Deletes what does not matter

What&#39;s up bro?
All is well
What about you?
Sabba
Well then the plan is to go get water
I was burned today, what a bastard
I may need to buy sunscreen bro

So go get some water
Then go to her
When to go out
I think another quarter of an hour and twenty minutes
Good
So what&#39;s next?
I&#39;m stoned
Do not know how it will affect the experience

I do not know what the point of entertainment?
Why do I want entertainment?
What is entertainment?
Entertainment - an event or action that provides interest or joy to the audience
Must be positive, is a sad movie not entertaining?
Must there be an audience?
When I play football, am I entertained?
Can there be one person entertained? of course
And that&#39;s why I&#39;m looking for entertainment, I&#39;m looking for a positive feeling
I&#39;m looking for interest
I&#39;m looking for joy
What interests me
What makes me happy?
Why did I see Gollstar?
Because it&#39;s funny
What makes me funny?
Why am I laughing?
Let&#39;s check out 9gag posts that made me laugh
A new and surprising relationship that I did not think of
insight
But not every new relationship or insight is funny,
For example if I&#39;m learning something new, I do not respond with a laugh,
Suppose I had an insight about the fact that entertainment is linked to a positive feeling so I&#39;m looking for it, it did not make me laugh
What is the difference between discovering that entertainment is linked to a positive feeling and discovering the connection between 2pac and Chubka - 2pacca
The other is a funny link - because it&#39;s surprising, I did not expect it, I did not look for it, I respond to surprise
But not everything that is surprising, funny, why 2pacca funny?
Why find that I forgot my wallet is not funny even that it is surprising
It&#39;s good that it&#39;s not funny to me, but it&#39;s funny to those around me,
Because the effect of this on me is negative,
But if there hadn’t been a negative impact, it wouldn’t have been that interesting, I still wouldn’t have laughed
Maybe there must be someone who is negatively affected by this relationship for me to be positively affected and laugh
Like for example that 2 pac would probably have been offended by this connection, or Chubka, I&#39;m not sure
Or maybe the laughter is out of embarrassment ...

Hey whats up?
Sabba
What about you?
All is well
What are you telling?
Walla
We sat with Javier and spent the night at sea
it was really nice
Finally seeing people
We talked a lot
We got a little out
Although I feel like the night is a little difficult with us
She is very left-wing
So anything a little very sensitive bothers her
But okay
Javier gets a little more accepting
He is also against this section that there is a rule of the elders of the people that has a lot of influence
But it was interesting to hear
This is what&#39;s besides that?
Not too much
Another weekend is over
I&#39;m kind of waiting for tomorrow to see Ashley again
I know she&#39;s not waiting to see me as much
But what do I care
As long as it&#39;s fun to see her
I&#39;ll try to give her maybe a way to contact me
See what you say
This is what else?
Do not know
I have been full time not working on the project
Maybe I can work with a news company on my specific idea
That can be cool
Okay
What else?
I also have the interest of finding people to live with me
And the matter of couple therapy
And at work I&#39;m a little stuck too
In the end I did not make a plan for the week
But in Gaza I have 3.5 days to do 5 things
As long as I&#39;ve enough everything in half a day will be fine
Do not know if I will suffice
But I will try
Also not really I have 3.5 days
Because there are a lot of meetings
And Ashley
But in a small way
This
What more
Do not know
What more?
In the end I did not take a day off this week
Next Week
Okay
What more
This seems to me
Okay
What&#39;s up?
I need to talk to Ja here
And also with Mikel
Although too much time has passed
Good
What more?
This is I know?
Feel like talking about something?
Do not know
I thought to myself why the US is the country with the most immigrants
Why everyone wants to come here
What happens if I do regression surgery by per capita income
Is this the deciding factor?
Can also be a language
And also ease of migration
Why is this interesting to me?
Because it&#39;s like supply and demand
I wonder why there is so much demand
Maybe the amount of work
If you look at the percentages, there are not that many true immigrants here
But is this the right look?
Of course it also matters
A larger country can absorb more immigration without affecting its culture
This
What more?
There was the analysis I did about the optimal attraction rate in retirement
I have found that it is possible to reach 6 percent if you are willing to live on half of it in difficult years
6 It&#39;s not enough
6% is 60 thousand, the tax is about 10% let&#39;s say (it depends on the level of income and it is between 2% if I do not earn anything to 20% if we earn let&#39;s say 100000)
So in total you have to earn about 80 thousand
80 thousand is 6% of about 1.3 million
That it&#39;s another year or two of work
It&#39;s a basa
I hope to raise this number
But it&#39;s hard to know
okay, well
Hopefully the other investments are working
we will see what will be
What more?
Ummm
My head is pretty empty
He was full of pain
As well as a past weekend
Don&#39;t know what&#39;s up with these headaches on weekends
Maybe it&#39;s a pressure release from this week
But do not know
It&#39;s not like I&#39;m so stressed out this week
So hard to say

Off a bit I feel like just cutting and being with a different whore every week
To travel every weekend to Mexico or something
Maybe it will happen
Do not know
I feel wrong with Sheeran doing this to her
But what about me?
I also need to feel fine with me
Maybe I should take a break from it?
Maybe
I do not know if I can just come and tell her such a thing out of nowhere
Oops
I do not know what to do



Okay
I&#39;m looking at how hard it is to build a website
It does not seem easy
I would be happy if there was an easy way to turn a program in the terminal into a web service
The truth is that maybe an electron can be an interesting way to do it
The dream is to just sign up for some web service, like Colab or Notebook then make it
But there are some problems here
I can not use Kolab, because I can not turn it into a server
Notebook may not work in browser…
I need to see what it&#39;s like on the iPad
I need to buy an iPad keyboard
And need a TV streamer
And need airfoods
It&#39;s not over this thing
I buy something a month
I also need to buy a gift for Sheeran
Probably something I experienced
Maybe some spa or something
I would take it to Disney, but it&#39;s expensive, about $ 100
And we are spending full money in the meantime
Fun day:
Massage will be $ 50 per person
Lunch
An evening party

We spend $ 6,000 a month, but that&#39;s because of the mortgage on the house in Alabama
So about $ 5300
I want to eat once a week to slow down my metabolism
But maybe so I can reach my target weight first

What except
Tomorrow I&#39;m on a day of kind of freedom at work
Yesterday was also a kind of day off
But not really because it was our marriage today

I could not solve the question of the acrunk
It&#39;s a basa
Find the maximum coverage of a graph using trees at a height of 1
I said look for all the combinations of heads
But there are too many of these, something like 2 ^ 50


array X
map filter reduce : f(X)
map: f:x^n -> x^n     [f(x) for x in X]        change values (edit values)
filter: f: x^n -> x^m    X’ in X            change quantity (delete values)
reduce: f: x^n -> x    f(X)            change values & quantity 

The army that is supposed to be the most right-wing body, but its premise is that the enemy thinks just like us
A graph appears to descend only with the breaking point in a certain direction lower than the previous breaking point in that direction
He constantly perceives that his glasses are crooked,
Then checks on a flat surface and sees that they are not curved
And he does not realize that it is not the glasses that are crooked, it is

&quot;No No&quot; is not &quot;Yes&quot;
For example if you want something to be wrong and do not find proof, it does not mean that it is

Why the hell do I need input

The matrix is going to happen with one difference… We are not batteries
We expend and put in energy in the same amount
Basically this is not the definition of batteries, batteries put in and expend the same amount of energy, but put that amount into them when you charge them, what is good about them is that they break down slowly and then do not need a direct connection to electricity
Electricity is produced differently, it is usually due to the burning of fuel, fuel is an organic substance that contains energy, the truth is that we too, but it is much more concentrated because it was in the center of the earth, probably more concentrated than it costs to expend.
So if you also consume this fuel in batteries, why not put a charcoal in your cell phone?
Charcoal needs to burn, the battery has a controlled chemical reaction that does it, the truth is that in our body the movement is also controlled,
Why not activate a cell phone from the energy of our body, because it is low, wow soon there will not be enough energy in the world to calculate! The calculation is exponential size, and the energy is not, I believe it will solve, but it should happen soon, maybe switch to solar energy, wow it&#39;s like an explosion, like lighting the earth on fire
It is ingenious to use the production of living semi-organisms perhaps in biological cells, for direct conversion from coal (or other organic matter) to electricity


Ask fast: fast without thinking 60 * 60 equals 360? Faster! Yes? Yes? Yes? Ahhh you missed

I defeated Sheeran in an argument:
I said Monica and Ross are the center of friends and she said Rachel because of the money, and then I said that everyone is friends only because of them they are the middle of friendships, and she agreed with me



Hi there are we still going for a meeting at work tomorrow I will probably not get back in the morning I’ll probably have a little time with him tomorrow morning if I have any chance you could do a little more work for us and I will do a good thing about you and you guys can get it done and get it to you I can get you some stuff tomorrow morning and get it done and I get back with work and get it to me I will need you some time and then you go get it done thanks so I will need you to get some stuff out there I can get you to get the rent done thanks so I will do a lot more tomorrow morning and I can get you to the party and get you to get it done and get back with you and I can just get to you go to the store tomorrow thanks
What a dangerous site
I&#39;m really addicted
It&#39;s just too much fun
They are such flirtatious
Makes me feel good
I do not know what to do
Well it&#39;s a hobby
Even if I spend on it 400 a month
It&#39;s not that I&#39;ve wasting too much
400 a month is 5000 a year
Out of 80,000, let&#39;s say I save
It is much
But not crazy
I do not buy too much
I have 200 for entertainment
And 200 for shopping let’s say
Half of mine
200 per month
Yes, I should try to stay at 200

Good
There&#39;s a week I&#39;m with Sheeran
And even now because she&#39;s not here, I need to on Saturday too
In fact, when she has a period, I need a Saturday anyway
3 times a week, 4 and a half weeks, say 13 times
Of which at least two Shabbats of Sheeran
And twice more, of ovulation
It&#39;s 4
So I just need another 9
On average it is 16 * 15 = 240 at a time
I should have 10 times a month for $ 200
I need 9, and the rest is to disperse
That&#39;s about 15 &quot;scatterings.&quot;

Good
What else?
What about the mole?
I need to call

Good
What else?
What about the project?
Miles?
Interview question?
planning?

Good planning is less critical this week it seems
Miles?

Semc
I could not resist the temptation
Nor did she fly over me
So it seems to me that I am less stressed about it now

Well what else?
There is nothing but nothing
I just want to have sex

I have so much on my mind
So many things to do duct point.
I want to buy a love talk
If 1 stack - win
If 2 stack - if other is 1, lower down to 1 - win
If other is 2, lower down to 2, enemy lower down to 1/0 - win
If other is 3, lower down to 3 (if 6 and up), enemy lower down to 1/0 - win
If 5/4 you lose
If other is 4/5, lower down to 3(if 6 and up)
If 5/4 lose,
If other is 6, lower down to 
Walk does not know
I want to be able to create code from the iPad
But at the moment it seems that it is not really supported
All I need is a code repository, and a jist that I can look at to see if it really works

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
All is well
What about you?
Sabba
How does it work? The woman? The project?
The work is fine
I pretty much finished with something annoying
I want to start a new project
I do not know what
I would love something related to computational learning
Maybe move more parts of morphine to computational learning
Do not know
The problem is that it&#39;s slow
But then how does Spitz do it
interesting
I have the project of the normalization of Spitz
It&#39;s really interesting
I&#39;m trying to think maybe there&#39;s something else in our program
Do not know
what else
I have the house that requires more work
It is not over
What more
The contract has a financial agreement
What more?
To travel to when
What more?
Elizabeth
Oops
That will save me
Maybe I need a psychologist
Maybe Ivaska
Maybe
There are the books that Jonathan recommended
What more?
The project
Not easy either
Good
There is also the active learning
But Ella does not like that I work on it

The US GDP should be equal to the national income.
That’s the private income (salaries), corporate income (profits) and public income (taxes).
The difference is “Consumption of Fixed Capital” which is depreciation. It’s ~3T
Salaries is the largest part, almost 10T
Capital income is 1.4T
Rent income is 0.6T
Corporate profit is 2T
Net interest 0.6T
Taxes on production etc 1.2T
Source: 

S&P 500 market cap is 23T and has p/e ratio of ~20, meaning 23/20~=1T in earnings (profits). Accounting for more than half the corporate profit (it’s possible that a lot of the profit is abroad, leaving the national income much lower than 1T)
Source: 

150M employees. Earning 10T$ meaning ~67K$ yearly.
There’s ~300M people, meaning ~34K$ per person

What do I do for Unwind?
Writing here?
It&#39;s not too active?
I can read a book

I don’t know what to do in my 3 free sessions
Oh yeah,
I have 3 free sessions a week right now
3 work sessions
3 free sessions
4 family sessions
10 work sessions
Wait, but a week has 21 sessions (3 a day - morning, afternoon, evening)
Should I have 5 family sessions?
I can aim for 4 work 3 free 4 family
Isn’t freedom the most important thing?

So today I tried gamifying my life
So I looked into creating apps
First i looked a flask, then went to electron, then cordova, then to how to convert python to js…
But I don’t know
I just don’t know what to do the have fun in my free time
I write
I like to write I guess…
Maybe I should start a blog…

What would I do if I was free?
Go fuck bitches and do cocain
I mean, is that all?
I would probably get tired of it
Well I’m not sure
Cocain is pretty addictive
But then maybe alcohol, weed and bitches?
What’s preventing you from doing that?
A wife…
As long as I don’t cheat it should be fine
My penis or mouth can’t touch her vagina or mouth
I can go to strippers
So strippers and alcohol instead of bitches and cocain
Lol
I don’t know if that’s going to make me feel much better…
Or just make me hornier and less motivated
There’s only one way to find out…
I can do an experiment
One month of strippers and booze

I don’t remember after the stripper being more prolific 
So the other hobby would be to work on projects as if they are a game
Gamify
Another option, volunteer, but then, won’t I be more productive if I just work and donate?
Don’t know

Because it’s 6 years I need to live like that now…
And then ±30 more, maybe 40?
I wish
I need to find a way to create ai to solve that mortality problem

What are the options?

Well then I went over the opportunities on crowdstreet
I could only analyze two there that were about multifamily
They were nothing
I can try to analyze other assets
I can analyze opportunities on other platforms
I also analyzed Neil&#39;s proposal
She&#39;s not something either
The rent they are asking for is really high
In total, I analyzed 9 opportunities
A good number is 20 suppose
Tomorrow I&#39;ll go with Nola&#39;s parents
Thursday we drive to the center
Then spend time in the center. Do not know how long we will have
Dude what?
I can next week analyze another 10-11 opportunities
And I&#39;m done
Then choose
And hope they accept me
Put 50k and I&#39;m done
And hope it goes well


Meet Joe!
There’s nothing Joe loves more than food!
There’s nothing Joe hates more than waiting for food!

That’s it!

Your customers are happy!
The waiters are happy!
You are happy!

Let’s turn Joe into a happy Joe!




Man is allowed
Bigger brain
Speech
Transfer of information
Every generation does not start from scratch
An idea is a sentence
A sentence is a combination of words
Word types
Bone, verb, adjective, adjective
Preposition, link words

I really want these
I guess it&#39;s simply because she&#39;s there
If there was anyone else I would probably want her
And I do not know what to do so
I can try to get interested in her private life
Check if it is on the cheats platform
And I feel bad about cheating?
I think as long as I do not do bad intentions, I do not think it is bad
I just want to be happy
And I think that&#39;s what Sheeran wants, too
I need to find an anonymous chat platform
Unload what I have
On the other hand I enjoy interacting with her
On the part of me it may be interfering with my progress
I&#39;m considering going to Norlink
But it did not hurt me at Apple
I just feel like I&#39;ll not die from there
I can try to bring it to Apple
Use Air Foods to read your brain a bit
Maybe write?
And if at Apple I do not know whether to stick with those on a project that I feel has less impact
Or move on to Peter for a project that may have a lot of impact

The only difference between a man and a woman
Is the size of the fertilization cells
Hence also the difference that they are the ones who are pregnant
Therefore they need a man who will stay with them for raising the baby as well
While the man&#39;s ambition is to spread the semen


But all this is irrelevant in the age of condoms, why not enjoy sex? Just enjoy it ... Just as man is able to transcend the physical need for reproduction as a monk he is able to (temporarily) transcend the need for procreation, the problem is solely in education, I will teach my childhood that what will lead it is fun, happiness,
Logic in mind:

that&#39;s it

Sanity Check:
not x and not y = not x nor y

It&#39;s unnecessary what I&#39;m doing now
It&#39;s just leaning on the past
Is it meditation?
There is an argument here:
On the one hand, reliance on the past
On the other hand meditation
what&#39;s right?
Why is it relying on the past?
Because I think about what to think
Do I confirm this claim?
If I did not do that, what would I do?
Do not know
So basically it&#39;s not meditation
Because I think what to do
Is it impossible to write in Fluo mode?
Am I in the flu now?
Probably not because I needed to fix something

I want a better platform to put these things
I want to work on the project
I have to decide on an apartment in SF
What more?
I need to get rid of repetitive work at work
Relocation

I do not know what to do…

Because I have so many things to do I do nothing…

I&#39;m kicking the Reminders
But I can not do everything there, because if there will be a day that I do not have an iPhone, then I can not move

I have so many tasks…

I need order

By and large there are several types of tasks:
Of money
Working
Relocation
Fluent
project
health
doctor
Rufesh


My tasks are in many places
Work-related tasks are found in Reminders, Radar, and Safari (all reading materials).

Relocation has a deadline, so it&#39;s quite a priority

At work I have an encyclopedia, conversion, speech, bugspray, grading
Tachles encyclopedia is very important because it is for all languages
Conversion is important right now, because it&#39;s in focus
Grading is very important because it is at the end of the real index
Bagspray is important because it allows for quick repair for everyone
Speech is important because there are a lot of problems there

The project should check the update from ib






Hey
what&#39;s going on?
All is well
What about you?
Sabba
Another week is over
Another week begins
Fine work,
I did not finish what I wanted but I am in a pretty good place for 3 tasks
Well I filled the status
What else?
I do not know what to do with Elizabeth
I want to put her a link to an invitation to talk to me on Messenger
Good
What else?
I need to take care of Alabama at home
I need to handle a financial agreement
What about the book? The games? The studies?
I will read a few more chapters in the book
What did we say?
Palms + dance
Guitar + vocals
Chess + Poker
Book
interview
Okay
Everything has time
What is the hazelnut?
Sabba
What else?
When did the interview come in?
On guitar day?
On a day without a book?
Also the guitar is only twice a week
I need to add the sun to get to 3 days
So what happens in the first?
Study for an interview and play the guitar
Then also Tuesday and Thursday (because even then you play)
What about the emails?
I can split it do during the week
Every day
And what about planning the week
Yes maybe it&#39;s unrelated
Emails and planning can be left to the surfer or first responder
Good
So an interview on Tuesday and Thursday, and maybe Sunday.
Good
What else?
Do not know, what about you?
Not too much
Good
What about the financial agreement?
I can try to set up a phone call
I also might be worth sending more emails
Good
what else?
What about the apartment?
Do not know
Flowing I guess
What more?
Miles
What to tell everyone?
Do not know the truth
I said for some 3 rounds
Do not want too many of these on the head
Especially since I do not think I will move on to them
Good
What more
So not saying anything?
I can postpone them for a few months
Good
What more?
That&#39;s quite a lot already
So what did we have:
Alabama House - Flowing
Financial agreement
Find more options
Schedule a call
Miles
Postpone by a few months
Habits:
Sunday Tuesday and Thursday: Palms and dancing
Monday Wednesday and Friday: guitar singing and interview
Every day a chapter in a book?

Good
Sheeran wants to change the trip
I have no power
Good
What to do?
Read a chapter?
Good

Maybe it&#39;s all about not being a sucker
My Turkish father, he had this concept of a sucker, do not be a sucker
And my mother Poland, she does not know what it is to be a sucker


Coming back to the history of the world

We started as climbing rodents
We learned to walk
We took over the world
We sat down
Built a house
Domesticated some animals
Domesticated some plants
No restriction of travel costs so no restriction on group size
Groups get bigger and more hierarchical 
Groups became villages
Villages became cities
Cities united to form countries

What information can I get on cities?
They are in general separated into:
Resident area
Commercial area
Industrial area
(public area)
City council
Parks
Schools
Temples?
Hospitals

I can check employment by city or metropolitan area apparently:


So I can see the info from the most rural, backwards settlements to the most advanced, see the progress of human society…

So the GDP per capita is proportional to the household income


If I live life for fear of dying I live life for dying
As if death is the main actor
Existential anxiety is our engine

How to buy a cell phone?
Comparison specification
What I&#39;m looking for:
Large monitor
Good processor
Good inner memory
4G
Normal battery
(Chipset)
(Operating System)
No pucks
Best price possible
Look at all the criteria and see that I have not forgotten criteria


So what do you think of God?
God is energy
It has always been always will be, it is in everything, and it decides the big future
Although knowing the starting points of energy, does it really point to the future?
If I know exactly where a ball is in the air, can I predict its next point?
No, because I do not know what the speed is, what the acceleration is, what is derived from any of its order in time
By and large the second derivative should suffice
What is special about the second derivative?
Do not know

Basically if you know what speed and what forces are at work you know everything
So only need one derivative
Do the working forces stem solely from energy?

By the way, this points to an uncertain future

Gravity is due to a mass that is actually equivalent to energy
Is an electromagnetic charge also equivalent to energy?

What do I think about religion?

The man heard voices in his head, that he did not know where they were coming from

Rock treats it as if God is reality
And should always be in the moment, in reality, together with God and not move away and think about the past or the future because the only thing that exists is the present
And maybe from here the name
How does this reconcile with my faith?
Do not know
Is this contradictory?
Reality is also energy
It&#39;s all energy

Is what matters to be in the moment?
After all, when you read the Bible, are you in the moment?
What is it to be in the moment?
To be in the flu
Be focused on only one thing
But not necessarily in the present
I mean, it&#39;s happening in the present
But you can concentrate on drawing a sample
And is in the present
And it fills your mind that there is nothing else that interferes
So
 
I want to break free!
I’m obsessed.
Not sure what to do about it
I need to get to 50k to be free
That should happen in ±4 years (end of 2022)
I want to get to 75k to keep growing
That’s 2 years later, and it makes my income grow
It’s not a lot
It depends on me being able to get 10%
Let’s see what happens with the real estate deal…
Either way, it’s ½ a million, it should be enough, as one provider.
4 years…
That’s fine I guess…
Why do I keep working on the investment thing?
Well 20% can get me there twice as fast.

I’ll be 40 in about 6 years…
40 is kinda old
And what did I do?
I wish I was working on language…
That’s the important stuff
I want to contribute my share.
I should go study, do some research…

4 years
200 weeks
Well the army took 4 years
It passed fairly quickly
The degree took more than 4 years…
A lot happened though…
Ammm
I’m getting ~12 days a year, that’s 2.5 weeks.
I need to take a vacation twice a year.
2 weeks, 10 days.
Break it down.
In Christmas I have a week, and usually thanksgiving too.
So the other weeks should be as far as possible from that.
That means April and August.
Right now I have 10 days, 2 weeks

But what do I do on that week?

What do I do in my spare time?
I don’t know 

I just want to not have to do anything…
And do what I feel like
But what do I feel like doing?
No clue…
Man
I’m empty

There was this thing, where I gathered all of the national accounts info…
Might be interesting to see how countries split their investments as well as companies.
It would be interesting to simulate that.
That’s pretty much what I’m doing in the prediction thing.
Something like civilization, but without the graphics.
Is there a way to answer a moral question objectively?
Is there absolute moral?
I guess there isn’t but stuff can be voted, according to the sum of collective morals.
One can do that by doing online votes…


How do I not waste my life…
What’s wasting life?
Just doing nothing
But that’s meditation, no?
Not exactly. Meditation probably involves inner examination or something…
Actually in meditation I’m supposed to not think of anything, so it’s actually exactly doing nothing.
And it’s actually harder than doing something, like playing video games or watching tv.
So is watching tv or playing video games wasting time?
Wasting is misusing, or not using something useful.
Time is useful, because it can be used.
So is watching tv and playing video games not useful?
If it brings joy, it’s probably not so bad.
I guess it’s about looking back and saying that was useful.
If I watch tv, after that’s over I look back, how do I feel.
So maybe I should say it’s not satisfying.
What is satisfaction?
I guess in general satisfaction is reaching a threshold.
Commonly meant for reaching a threshold of one’s expectation.
So if I’m not expecting to get anything, there’s not threshold and anything I do is satisfying.
But is that the case? Can I not expect anything? It’s like just waiting to die.
What’s missing? What do I expect?
Good question.
What’s my biggest problem?
Lack of freedom. Everyday I have to go to work. I can’t have sex with other women.
So do I expect to solve that? Would that satisfy me?
For work I can just save enough money that it generate enough to sustain half a family, probably around 500k. It’s going to take ±6 years from now…
What do I do with the women part?
I can do that behind the back or I can get a divorce?
I can just walk the border and go to strip clubs…
That’s not complete freedom, but being single might also not be complete freedom.
THere’s no such thing as complete freedom.
I’ll cross that bridge I guess.

If I want to use my time right I need to move further to being free. The problem is that many times that’s not fun. And then I’m wasting time I could use for fun.
So what’s more important freedom or fun?
I guess both are. That’s why I’m dividing my free time in 2, one part for fun (3/21 parts of the week) and one part for work (4/21 parts of the week)
So for fun I should only care about fun, not satisfaction. If that’s the case I should go to strippers. 

The problem is that it’s expensive. It’s ±200$ each time.
Looks like video games is the next best, but it’s a bit more expensive, so then there’s tv, they are pretty much tied.

What else?

It&#39;s Sheeran&#39;s birthday
I wrote her a greeting
I&#39;m missing a line
Have fun in our lives
Or in the school of our lives
then what
Do not know
That you will continue to be the
Unless you can be a Wonder Woman
It&#39;s best to register Batman
Well I finished
What else?
Tomorrow we&#39;ll go somewhere
Then Tuesday-Wednesday another place
Then last Thursday
Friday flying
Time flies


6 fricking years…
What am I doing in the meantime
I want to have fun


Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Everything is fine
What about you?
Sabba
Lisa did not come
It&#39;s a basa
But I had to see it coming
Nothing has changed
I enjoy the conversations with her
And enjoy what c2c, so what the problem
Two months ago I did not know if I would see her again
And she also stopped talking to me
But now she&#39;s on my Skype
So we can always talk I guess
But I really would like you to come
I feel that if sex with her is really good,
And the communication is good,
Maybe she&#39;s the perfect woman…
Although it does not seem to me that if I get divorced I will marry again

Let&#39;s define
free will -
Choice - take a subset of given options
Free - in person, without the use of external force

Do we have the option to take a subgroup?
Without limiting generality let’s say it’s just taking one option out of two
Can we do that without external force?
Because we have internal loops, we are supposedly our own external force.

Can a coin fall on one side and not the other without external force?
I suppose so
There is a parallel world where the currency falls on the other side
Does the currency have a free choice?
The word &quot;conscious&quot; is missing in the definition of choice.
Conscious taking of a subgroup
A currency has a choice if it has consciousness

What is consciousness?
To be aware of something is to have knowledge about something
Does the currency have knowledge?
The computer has knowledge, is it aware?
Maybe this is the amount of possible situations in the system

They argue that choice is not taking a subgroup
Perhaps the word conscious is missing here
Are all elections conscious?
Suppose I choose something because I have a feeling about it, and not consciously, is it not a choice?
This too is a choice I guess
So there is no need to insert the word conscious
But then does a currency choose a side to fall on?
No
Currency can not choose, in the conventional sense
Why?
Because the currency has no desire
And what if choosing a computer?
Is it not a choice?
And what about the lottery, were the numbers chosen?


awareness
When claims it requires focus
The ability to focus on something
What is it to relax?
Choose something and concentrate on it
Pay attention
Be aware of one thing
But basically it&#39;s circular
The example he gave is Wikipedia
Is the Wikipedia server aware?
He has a lot of knowledge
But he does not dwell on anything
It could be argued that he is complacent about what is being asked of him
If I request certain information from Wikipedia the servers will fax over this information and return it to me
Is there a duty to focus on one thing?
And if I&#39;m an alien who can do two things at once
Or a robot with several cores
Are each of them aware that each of them is making a focus?
Is the difference that I can choose my focus?
Then we return to free choice
I do think we are machines
But then can we really change anything?
Are we quantum computers?

Maybe
But most of the scientific community seems to me not to think that way
That&#39;s not to say it&#39;s not true



so what are we doing?
I can check out the opportunities on crowdstreet
Okay…
And Bill Bava&#39;s opportunity

Good
what else…


This is what except חוץ
what is the plan?
I will find orders at 50k
Maybe 2 a year
That should be enough
That way every five years I have between 250 and 500k invested
And are supposed to yield 100k on average per year…
I can live with it…
Finding an investment can be a two-week process when I am experienced
I guess you have to choose from between 10 and 100 deals let&#39;s say, 20-30 maybe
I can analyze a deal in a few minutes to an hour let’s say
Or can I pay someone to do it for me…
What else?
is nothing
Intermittent passing
I only eat between 12 and 20
Lunch at 12
I eat a snack or two
Then dinner at 8 p.m.

For lunch I usually eat some meat dish like chicken or salmon or beef, with some side dish like mashed potatoes or mac and cheese or rice, and a salad
For dinner it is usually toasts with cheese and avocado and egg and tuna, and then oatmeal with some chocolate and milk cornflakes.
Basically snacking on cookies and some salty snack (Doritos or something)

Do not know if it is enough calories…
I miss the calories of breakfast…

Well what else

So what are we doing here? Are we folding are we shaking?
What’s the plan?
Recession?
News2Roi?
Courses?
Music?
Arabic?

I don’t know




I guess recession is interesting and urgent, and I should look into it again
Previously I couldn’t really make use of that…
New2Roi is my current project
Maybe Music will be next
I should do courses as part of my ride home or something…
What about Arabic?
It’s a course…
I can do it on the ride



I have no power for this life
do not know why
I&#39;m in a pretty promising situation in terms of the project
I believe I can make more than 12% if I work with news
I also might be able to do this if I work with xgboost on fundamental information
But that&#39;s not what&#39;s bothering me
I&#39;m not a social bastard
I&#39;m not dying for Sheeran
I&#39;m not dying for the &quot;cro&quot; here
Itzik quite bothers me to mix, because he speaks Hebrew
I guess you can get by with that
At work, meanwhile a spin, but I&#39;m afraid I will not really move team at the end of the project…
What bothers me the most I guess is Sheeran…
She&#39;s taking me energy, and I think I&#39;m her too
I do not have the strength to go home…
I do not know if it&#39;s specific to Sheeran
I guess with each one I would have had problems
I&#39;m less attracted to her now
She raised a little
But who would I replace her with?
Sivan, no
goddess? She has a girl, not that it&#39;s devastating, but surely sex will not be something
But this is true for every woman after pregnancy. I also do not know if she is interested
who else?
Itzik&#39;s gallbladder, no
Coastal? Do not know, a little stolen, and not reset, but do not know if it is so terrible, also do not know if she is interested.
Maybe the problem is monogamy…
what can we do?
Go to the strippers?
Do not know…
What does it help me to write all this?

I need mvp
All I need is to download all the daily information, and run the predictions on it
I can deal with improvements bro

What else?
How are you doing this fucking day?
Ssssemc
I feel like dying
And I do not know why
Hard with this stinking life
And they don&#39;t even stink like that
But that&#39;s the feeling
How to change this shit
Why he suffered
Why depression
what can we do?
meditation?
I would go home to shit but Sheeran might be there
If I get 12% credit
The problem is that I do not include taxes and inflation
If inflation is 2%, and taxes are 20% of profit, then to reach 10% I have to earn
I = (10+2)/.8=15%
Because then I earn 12 after tax, which is equal to 10 after lowering inflation

7 -&gt; After inflation 5 -&gt; After tax 4
12 -&gt; After inflation 10 -&gt; After tax 8
17 -> 15 -> 12
22 -> 20 -> 16
So for 10 I need something like 15 (14.5)

It&#39;s depressing…



Idea for a movie
(Remember my brother I wanted to check out how I once talked to girls)
Humans are reaching a new planet
Something&#39;s going on in the adults&#39; cell, everyone&#39;s dead
The children are left to fill the world
This world is the earth

Good

It could also be that the adults stayed and the technology was not simple
Maybe it was a strategy from the beginning

You can not hear yourself from the side
You can not see yourself from the side
You can know nothing about yourself from the side
You have no idea what&#39;s going on from the side

Three dimensional Image display, using laser projection.

Invention Background:
There are many types of 3D displays:
·        Stereoscopic 3D displays show a different image to each eye
·        Auto stereoscopic 3D displays do this without the need for any special glasses or other head gear. within this type, there are several methods, such as:
o       Flat Panel device:
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ A lenticular lens is an array of magnifying lenses, designed so that when viewed from slightly different angles, different images are magnified.
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ A parallax barrier, consists of a layer of material with a series of precision slots, allowing each eye to see a different set of pixels, so creating a sense of depth through parallax. A disadvantage of both technologies is that the viewer must be positioned in a well defined spot to experience the 3D effect.
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ Eye tracking device, that automatically adjust the displayed images to follow the viewer's eyes as they move their head, only suitable for one person.
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ Holographic 3D displays: reproduce a light field which is identical to that which emanated from the original scene
o       Volumetric displays, where some physical mechanism is used to display points of light within a volume. Such displays use Voxels instead of pixels.
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ multiplanar displays, which have multiple display planes stacked up
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ A swept-volume display: the three-dimensional image is formed by illuminating a rapidly moving display surface, which may be a spinning diffuser. Typical schemes use a circular screen rotating at about 900 rpm, which sweeps a spherical volume at each half-rotation.
▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪ Static volume: In the simplest case, an addressable volume of space is created out of active elements that are transparent in the off state but are either opaque or luminous in the on state. When the elements or voxels are activated they show a solid pattern within the space of the display.

This Invention is based on the auto stereoscopic, volumetric display, with no need of any special device to view the image, and by displaying the image "as is, and can be viewed from all directions, unlike the flat panel.
 
Abstract:
The device uses lasers with sufficient amout of energy, that it's light course is seen duo to the existence of impurities in the sorrounding air. by spreding the Laser beam, through a mirror or a lens, thus making it less powerfull so it would not be seen to the viewer, and using a second mirror or lens to focus it to one single point, making it a single voxel in the air, no oother medium needed.
the device consists of many rows of this kind of laser projection, to creat a whole screen, and creating several screens one behind the other, to create a three dimentional image, layer by layer.
there is a possibility to use rotating mirrors to create a scan, not projecting all the lasers at once, but projecting the laser through several lenses or mirrors on a high frequency.
 


 
 
 
I would like to:
Drugs?
Sure
I’d like to take mushrooms…
But then I either have to grow, or somehow know someone…
I don’t see how I’ll know someone…
I think Jonathan or Sivan can hook me up, but I’m not comfortable asking.
I can sit in the park and wait for one…
A good grow kit is 50$
It’s not very expensive
The spores are 20$, which is really not expensive…
I can go to mexico, or brazil, or amsterdam, or iceland

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
How about work, wife, friends?
At work fine
You can no longer go to the office so it&#39;s a bit of a hassle
It will hurt my power
I need to ask to take another screen from work
Good
What more?
With Sheeran okay, we&#39;ll be traveling to Mexico soon
But she&#39;s in a cycle
So I&#39;ll probably be there by hand too
I do not mind the truth
I only have some 550 credits, that&#39;s enough for two more times
Good
I also want to send Elizabeth a link to my Skype
And also a link to Dick Pick
Good
What more?
Friends?
OK
I said maybe meet with Javier sometime
I&#39;m ashamed that our groups are separate
What about poker?
I&#39;m not ready yet
You need to read this thing
I guess I should end up with the prenuptial agreement
And with the house in Alabama
It&#39;s not over with this shit
what else?
I was thinking maybe opening a Tinder account or something, for legal sex
Do not know if it will work
But I found a spin image that I can use in the profile
And see what happens
Can be interesting
Good
What more?
Do not know
How was the first one?
There was a turn
The truth
It was interesting
I had interesting thoughts on how to reconcile equality and growth
Basically if we increase the mobility between deciles we should have a better and more egalitarian economy

what&#39;s up bro?
everything is great
I have an interview this week
And I also have an interview with LinkedIn in about two to three weeks
A little stressful
There is also the section with the house in Alabama
I want to transfer to LLC
And do refinance along the way
But it turns out it&#39;s separate
And the refinance is not going smoothly
Something about the service charge and the size of the loan or something
Good
What else?
There&#39;s my sister&#39;s wedding
But there&#39;s a big situation I can not reach
There are not so many flights in April
And I have to arrive about two weeks before to be in isolation
mess
Baside that?
Had a nice hike yesterday
I have something to talk about when
But he&#39;s a little stressed and stressed
Do not know
He turned around
Last week was a cool mushroom ceremony
Was interesting
Feels I forgot a lot
I got stuck in a loop on these
Sucks a bit
It&#39;s just like peeing
That you tell yourself what I&#39;m going to get up and go (to the bathroom, or to another job)
But on the other hand you can not go on (sleep, or work) without constantly thinking about it
In the end I went to the bathroom
I was full of pee
Because what girls do not masturbate?
Safe masturbation
I wonder if it&#39;s for people they know
I wonder if she masturbated on me
Because if so, why not do it
One spouse for children, and another for diversity

The thought is like that
As I get closer to retirement half of my income is from capital
To take me both half of the income and half of the capital it does not make sense
It&#39;s going to take me everything

Good
So we agreed
What else?
This
Was less flowing with Ashley today
As if she did not really leave the conversation flowing
But it is understandable
She probably has a lot of people on her mind
Good
Sabba
What else?
There was nothing at work
I need a plan
I will write tomorrow

Sabba What&#39;s next?
I&#39;m thinking of doing tattoos for all my grandparents
Tattoo of the symbol of life (either a tree or the symbol like a cross with a circle at the top)
A tattoo of a rose
Sun tattoo if God forbid something happens to the doll

Okay
What else?
This
There was an interesting lecture on why the world is becoming more right-wing
Basically because the Soviet Union had fallen there was no longer an alternative

Okay
What else?
This is not know
Tomorrow is Rosh Hashanah
So what?
Do not know
Good
What else?
Not too much

So what do I do with Ashley?
I want to offer her to give her my details
See what she says about it
But what details will I give her?
I&#39;m afraid to give the main email because it has my last name on it
Then she will find Facebook and Sheeran
I can just produce an email

The surfer has a situation that today is my freedom
Then I&#39;ll talk to her
And if she is not then someone else

Good
Beauty
What more?
Truth be told just two weeks ago I took a day off
So maybe I will not take now
Maybe next week
Well let&#39;s see what happens
What else?
Do not know
Okay

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
OK
What about you?
Sabba
Still upset about Lisa
A section I&#39;m more upset about over Google
Apparently this guy is really impressive
All the girls remember him
really
Oops
As if it makes sense to have someone more equal than me
I just thought Lisa was locked on me
It seems to me this is what broke me
But I should have known that was not true
She did not come here
She does not write to me outside of work
It&#39;s just, it&#39;s a game
I do think they think I&#39;m handsome
Although I have no way of knowing
Suppose today she really flattered me
Do not know
They also love my rooster
That the truth is that he turned around
Shorter does not know
I think it&#39;s pretty authentic
Or they play well
What can I do
Wait for me to run out
It will probably take a month
We know about 9 months
About June
It&#39;s a lot of time
There is a situation that it will take more than a month
I&#39;m locked up for 9 months
Although if I had to choose her or these?
Do not know the truth
She is more beautiful than these
But those have something
Maybe because she&#39;s the boss
Maybe
But she&#39;s really doing it to me
Good
Why I&#39;m horny all the time
Horny all the time
Maybe I should find someone in the real world
The place I walk in will probably not help
It&#39;s just disgusting
so what are we doing?
Keep searching
Good
What else?
We were at an event of the Borders of the Day
It was nice
Get to know some people
Speak
No complaints
Tonight we&#39;ll probably go for something else
I&#39;m a little pissed I&#39;m unshaven and such
But what to do
Some still think I look good
Good
What else?
At work I was still stuck
we will see what will be
What to do?
Also want me to continue working on the second part
And I do not know if I can, it&#39;s much more volume of work
I&#39;ll talk to Nolan
Good
What else?
project?
Do not know
Raise your brain to the cloud?
Okay
You have an idea?
Do not know
How can I best contribute?
Maybe research
But research I can do from home
Maybe read their article
Maybe
Good
Let&#39;s make it simple
By and large there are electrodes that are supposed to be attached to each neuron
The truth is that it seems the most complicated to me, there are billions of neurons
So does that mean billions of electrodes will be sewn into our brains?
That&#39;s pretty crazy
But there is a situation
Maybe just one area of the brain is enough, that if we add a few more neurons it will get better
Maybe
Oops it feels far away
I&#39;ll probably die…
Semc
Hard to know, but it does not seem to be progressing fast
Despite Ayalon
Good
so what are we doing?
Enjoy what you have
Well and I&#39;m having fun?
Half power
How can you enjoy more?
Maybe in bachelorhood
Just a lot of prostitutes?
Do not know

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Can&#39;t get Hannah out of her head
I&#39;m thinking of bringing her
Pay her for a flight to Saint-Pierre
And meet with her
And it seems to me that she will agree

What&#39;s the point of suddenly keeping track of expenses
Enough already
Where do I have my own card?
I need to achieve something like this
Maybe Robin Hood?
Maybe not a trade
Maybe interactive brokers
Or just order once a month and that&#39;s it

Good
What else?
Everything is fine
I opened it with Sheeran
okay, well
I explained myself a turn

What else?
Walla
Not too much
I was thinking of working on the project
But not so know how
I thought from the iPad
But he&#39;s with Sheeran
If I work from the computer I&#39;m afraid they&#39;ll say it&#39;s Apple property
Not that I really think it will happen
But what are the options?
Maybe develop in the cloud
how?
It is possible in vim on the site
It&#39;s possible
I can do ssh from thermius to instance


Freedom of choice
Is this an illusion, which stems from the fact that we choose between similar alternatives?
Does living have freedom of choice?
The illusion of freedom of choice versus the illusion of causality
If there is no causality, there is randomness. But there is randomness at the quantum level
What exactly is freedom of choice?
The ability of an entity to choose between alternatives
Can an animal also choose? Can.
Like the donkey that is right between two piles of gravel. He will have to choose even though there is no priority

How can there be randomness as well as causality?
The solution in quantum as far as I know is when measuring the state collapses into one state
Or we are able to measure only one state, and the other states exist in parallel
Does this contradict causality
Probably not because science still stands, and aligns with quantum theory
Why do we have a choice?
Is everything predetermined?
Is it possible to see the rest of the dimensions?
As a man is born with one eye. He does not see three dimensions. But it is capable of taking on more dimensions
Maybe a quantum computer could take up more dimensions
Maybe even jump between them
So there is no freedom of choice?

Hey, what&#39;s up?
How was yesterday?
Sabba
It seems to me the main thing is the new investment strategy
Besides, I also feel that I have made progress in raising my brain to the cloud

There are many things
There are things of Shabbat
Things of Rosh Chodesh
interview
And strategy

The most important interview
I need to plan how to prepare for a Google interview
Go over to System Design, and machine learning and language processing
It is much

On Saturday I solve a question going through the emails and planning the week
So I solved a question, I can go through the emails
The program for this week is the plan to prepare for a big interview
That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing now in a big way

What about the things of Rosh Chodesh and the investment strategy?
Of the two, I prefer to suffice for the things of Rosh Chodesh, to keep the cycle
Investment strategy can be postponed a bit
Yes I would rather hit the iron when it is hot
But I do not have time…
Maybe I&#39;ll have time
It also writes code, maybe it will help the interview

Good
So what do we have?
To plan the week, it&#39;s to think of a strategy to learn for Google
Leave time to go through system, machine learning and language processing
How long? One evening
Suppose by dinner I go through emails and plan the week
Dude, let&#39;s see if I have time for Rosh Chodesh

Let&#39;s finish with the emails
It seems to me that there is not too much

Maybe think of significant events I want to talk about?
That we have come a long way with the Code Week project
That I presented my work at an Apple conference, and another joint work was accepted for the conference
That I have a number of projects that are currently in production
I got oxide on team work
That my principal took me with her to a new team
First place users -
Push Data Drive Development

What more?
I can look at the feedback I have received in recent years
And for what I wrote down about myself, to collect situations

What about hypothetical questions -
What&#39;s going on in my life?
Sabba
Still engaged in active learning
Peter is dying to get rid of me it seems
Tomorrow I will finish the important part

It&#39;s a bit of a bastard because you can do amazing projects with this thing
But what to do

As long as I can retire for another five years, I&#39;m not complaining
I do not think I will be fired
Objectively this year I made a great contribution

Well what else?
Walla not too much
Because I do not have too much hazel for the evening, I do not do too much
I was thinking of getting into Unity
It looks nice overall
Pretty simple, I know…

I also want to make songs

Too many things
I looked at the verbs that appear in the timeline of history
The majority is around battles and victories
But I think most of it is about money and resources
I can try to predict next year&#39;s output
Maybe try to go back in time and see if the pace is really quite constant
We produce 3% more about every year
And give birth to 1.5%
This means that technology brings in 1.5%
We give birth to two things at a fairly even rate
Children and ideas

Well, so what
Do not know

What do I do with my life
I was dying to make the coast
She&#39;s stolen

What more
I want to go to Burning Man
But do not know if it will happen
Not pushing there in a hundred horsepower

I want my project to finally rise

That I may not have to work
Do what I want

Now suppose I do not have to go to work
what am I doing?
Traveling?
Makes electronic music?
politics?
Wikinews
This is amazing
Deep learning

This does not know what else

I play this catchy game every day
This is nonsense
I need to replace that in the game of the project

I am currently using gitlab
I can connect wrike or jira with gitlab or bitbucket

What more
what am I doing

I wasted yesterday on just an evening
I drank too much and had a headache all day
Just a waste of a day


Ok שלום so what I wanted to say was they believe that justice is not being done.
I was diagnosed we have to work hard to be successful Inter we have to make peace Elder we have to send love letters
עחליך
ייייח עעעם let me know moving moda
What do I do with my life
what are the options?
Explore Deep Lerning in the field of natural language
Find a way to retire at a young age
If I save 50% and make 10% on the money I retire within 7 years
I I do 7% I retire within 10 years

The truth is that it is not contradictory
I can work on investing with Deep Lerning and maybe get a good percentage
I can use it for real estate investments


I have a headache
I got a little stressed out because I&#39;m not really showing up tomorrow
I still have to present something the next day
Good
Everything is fine
Sheeran has not yet returned to me regarding the treatment
Something has to happen
I did not forget about it
There must be a change in behavior
Good
Besides, I did not have time to prepare for the next day
That means more work tomorrow
I also need to work on metatization
Good
what else?
Do not know
Still need to finish with the lawyer
Okay
Should also finish with the house, but it seems to me that it works out
I have to study for Google
Good
What more?
Do not know

What about donations?
What about CPA?
Probably have to wait
Right now the focus is on Google

Still need to end with the financial agreement

Good
What more?
Do not know
I have no power
Two more weeks for Maniac
Then New Year Beach
In Gaza, it will be over in another three years
Maybe four
I&#39;m about 600
Every year about 120
*3
360
960 It&#39;s almost it
What about donating?
Yes
Need some 1,100
And also, I do not spend only 60 a year
Closer to 70
That means 1160 (another sixth)
And another 10% donations
It&#39;s 1270
It&#39;s another two years of work
Semc
It is not over
I must be from now on
It&#39;s not that I suffer
I&#39;m a little suffering
It&#39;s not easy for me with Sheeran
Not easy without friends
What to do?
Do not know
What would a good life look like?
Full of girls
Parties
Society
Drugs
Good
What else?
This
So this is what I would do all day sex and drugs?
Please
Is there anything I enjoy more?
Do not know
I suppose there is a difference between the satisfaction of an instinct and the satisfaction of the soul
There is a state of flu
I think it can be reached in sex
But it is also possible in other ways
I would leave everything and go to Colombia or Russia for a month
Makes full of sex and drugs
Then decide on the sequel
but I can not
There is work
And there is a woman
I guess someday I&#39;ll get tired
Like I&#39;m tired of walking after DRAM
Good
Bye
The goal: to be the center of gravity of the group
You have an amount of credit and you need to determine to whom you are distributing it.

For example for three players:
If the other two give each other more king you lose
The goal is for both of them to give you more

You can also give to yourself
You need to be given the most
Everyone is trying to get into this situation
So for that actually invest more in the weak, which does not threaten you
On the other hand you do not want only the support of the weak
Because it also matters how strong your supporter is
You want to have the highest self-vector value
You want to be first in page rank
That&#39;s what everyone wants, too

For three players:
There is a 3 * 3 matrix
You set one line to maximize your page rank

How does the page rank work?
You take the self-vector that belongs to self-value 1, because it is the solution of a steady state.

For two:
Av = v
a11*v1+a12*v2=v1
(1-a11)v1+(1-a12)v2=v2

a11 * v1 + a12 (1-v1) = v1
a12 = (1 + a12-a11) v1
a12 / (1 + a12-a11) = v1

a12 = 0.5 * (1 + a12-a11)
a12 + a11 = 1
pole: 1+a12=a11 -> a11=1, a12=0

According to this, it is better for each player to simply invest only in himself
There is no guarantee that investing in someone else will help
It&#39;s like a gift:
You give in hope

Dear diary
JK
Why do I feel critical?
Am I just repeating the words I hear every day?
There is a big situation
You can check:
Record all the words that go through my mind
As I do now
And compare to the distribution that appears in the media (let&#39;s say movies)
And see how different the distribution is
Then need to check if the rest of the difference is explained by other factors (probably family friends work)
And surely there is also a percentage that just comes from within

Clearly there is a very strong external influence
You can check if it is linear for the amount of time
The more I work with, the more my language will be
As much as I am with friends this will be my language
The more I am with myself, the more my language will be

Pretty

What now?
That&#39;s why I have to stop working

How inflation is zero and housing prices are sky high

how?
Housing prices are rising:

And labor prices:

So it&#39;s not just labor prices
Just prices went up
If the price goes up by about one percent, then with a pretty solid investment you make 5% (because the bank leverages 80%)
And more rent dividends, say four percent
Which is 9%
This is not bad
And more solid than the capital market
The question is whether he will continue like this
Because right now rentals look pretty cheap
When does it become unequal?
The truth that making a 4% solid always seems pretty worthwhile
So why not
I specifically hope for more than 4%
But it turns out that whoever does it does not seem to me to suffer

How do housing prices rise and the price index not?
mozar

Price index:


The truth was there was deflation then
So there is an interest in the price index going up

The interest rate made by the bank should also be lowered

If the bank makes one percent, and I make one percent, then I earn 4 percent instead of 5, no?
It still comes out 8%
That&#39;s good in a big way
And this is where inflation comes from

Interest rates are linked to inflation and house prices are linked to interest rates
Inflation rises when house prices rise, house prices rise when interest rates are low because it is worth buying, when interest rates are low inflation
How does it work?

So how much is my time worth in retirement?
On the one hand it is worth infinity because I do not need any more money
On the other hand I am limited in my spending, so any spending over budget is worth infinity relative to my time
So maybe my alternative cost if I go back to the market
The question is whether I can even return to the market
There may not be a stage
So the value of my time decreases with time
Maybe the value is my price as a contractor
For life you need sun, air, water and earth or other life
Why do you need sun - photosynthesis
Why do you need air - for oxygen
Why do you need water - for hydrogen
Why do you need soil - for carbon
Four Elements

The water comes from the ocean, in the ocean there is life, even without earth to decompose
So where does carbon come from? Maybe from the bottom, or from the beach?
The water also evaporates but there is no carbon in the air so there is not so much life there, even though there is some carbon,
The water evaporates and moves inland, until it encounters a mountain, or heats up enough to condense into precipitation, and descends
There is no life in the mountains, perhaps because there is little oxygen there, perhaps because the soil is not rich enough?
The water concentrates into gorges (and streams into rivers) and flows back into the ocean. In the valley there is a lot of life because of the balance of the elements.

Why did man domesticate predators?
To be hunted for him?
Were cats hunted for man?

Why exactly these three elements?
1, 4, 6

The next order of magnitude is proteins, carbohydrates and fats
Fat is the shell
The protein is the skeleton
And the carbohydrate is the energy
It&#39;s a bit like css html and javascript
Although another important part is the DNA which is the information
And the water

So it turns out that there are two other important elements: nitrogen and phosphorus

The fat consists of a hydrophilic part with oxygen and hydrogen and a hydrophobic part without oxygen
The hydrophobic part can also turn into carbohydrates which are carbon rings
The protein is pre-composed with an oxygen side and a nitrogen side that can bond between them, and a carbon body with nitrogen, oxygen and a combination of both or neither
The power of carbon is that it binds easily and breaks down easily, so it forms a skeleton for many molecules
Oxygen is negatively charged
Nitrogen is positively charged


In essence the elements that make up the world are simply God of metals.


I consider how long after retirement, if there is no avalanche, you can withdraw 8%
Because if you&#39;re just retiring in the glider, then you know it&#39;s probably always going to be okay
The maximum is ten years because it is a complete cycle
If I retire at 40 and after ten years, well not ten, 9
Still mid-work?
Probably because of the linearity, which after 5 years is a spin
And by 45 I believe I will be able to come back
Especially if I work on some side project that can be perceived as work


Maybe positive towards myself is my frequency
The frequency of exchanging the positive towards the self with the negative towards the self

As for race
FastAI 2
Work on news2roi2
Recession
FastAI resources
Cleanup tabs
Emails
RealEstate
Deeplearning.ai course

Too much to do too much to see

I need to check how good the news2roi is doing

Ways to improve:
Add data
Use FastAI data preprocessing 

Goal?
Minimum 12%/year

I can do ~7% on the s&p, but just 4-5% to be safe…

The null hypothesis - go bankrupt,
If probability < 5% 





How I arrange the calendar
Add keyword - meetup
Is the meetup under the theme or vice versa?
How to read all my investigations / comparisons?
Put everything related to code together
Put a course under a topic or a topic under a course?
Add category - errands errands
Are interviews this under code?
Put everything related to working together
Normalize letters
Language processing under computational learning?
Category Apartment search
Group planning
Real estate under investment?
Phone calls under arrangements?

Check out the design
Maybe turn into tags and save only the last one


So what&#39;s the plan?

According to the data, I am supposed to do between 7 and 10 percent a year and retire for another 7 to 10 years

That&#39;s why it&#39;s worth concentrating on what interests me
I am largely interested in machine learning, specifically natural language
I was going to try to develop something in the field
There are some projects I can work on:
Predict the capital market, as I have already begun
Predict the real estate market, or value of a home
Use language processing
To predict the capital market
Predict the real estate market
Another area
Customer Service
secretary

It seems to me that in the first stage I will try my hand at Kegel
Because it&#39;s a big supportive environment
It is also good to find a job later
And there are also tasks of real estate and natural language

There is no hazelnut here it seems to me

Where would I like to see myself in another 5 years?
Where would I like to see myself in the end?
What is the dream?
Pass a Turing test



Budget analysis
I spent 77k instead of 70
On housing I was supposed to spend 36 and I spent 45
But it&#39;s mostly because of the apartment
And the apartment makes money
On food 11.5k instead of 9.5 (21%)
When on restaurants 4.7 instead of 4.2 (11%)
And on bars 1.4 instead of 0.6 (130%)
I did not go over trips
But about renting a car 1.6 instead of 1.2 (33%)
On shopping, 4 instead of 3 (33%)
On Entertainment 4.3 instead of 3 (43%)
On 3.2 accounts instead of 2.4 (33%)
About Transportation 2.4 instead of 0.6 (300%)


I earned 5 on taxes
I also spent 1.3 on gifts

I can do an analysis of scattered expenses
For example food
Or transportation

I need to start a business to separate business expenses and privacy

There is no significant deviation here
10% is not terrible
It&#39;s a bass if I live on the scales
But with a million dollars it&#39;s not supposed to happen

Well what else
Investment analysis needs to be done
Can&#39;t find an app for it
Good
What to do?
We&#39;ll sleep on it
Tomorrow is the wedding
Good
Tomorrow I will also sit down with Sheeran for the interview
Good
What else do I have to do?
What is the hazelnut?
What is there besides investment analysis?

This is my brother
To enjoy
If I do 18% with the syndicate I&#39;m done
That&#39;s all I need
Name 50k every year
Until I have 300k every year in the syndicate
Will make 60k
The rest of the 700 will do another 60 maybe

Tachles I do not spend 6.5 a month
I spend 5.7, another 0.8 is on a mortgage and such on an apartment
That it really is not much
Less than 70 a year
I can raise the shopping at some 0.1 and still be below 70
Sabba
It&#39;s nice I only need 70
As if it&#39;s not that little yes
Sure with inflation it will be more, yes

Well I need to do an LLC and a bank account for the property
That will not appear to me as an expense
it&#39;s confusing
Maybe I need some accountant

How do I analyze the investments?

It may be that the mechanism of action for programming people is to determine whether a feeling is positive or negative.
After something intense happens, adrenaline passes through the body, the adrenaline is a signal used to condition the intense thing that happened with your feeling at that moment. The decision whether it is good or bad, belongs only to a person through culture.
This does not contradict the fact that sometimes there are things that release other substances, like serotonin or dopamine that have a clear positive effect.
Make a diary of what I did and how it made me feel
Actually I&#39;m already recording what I did
Just need to add how much it was positive or negative
Happiness: the general feeling of well-being. If joy is a weather then happiness is a climate.

Nothing is important.
What is important?
Money? No
Intelligence?
Love?
God?
The country?
The people?

Can I think of times when I was happy?
I can think of times when I was sadder than usual.
When we moved from the Kibbutz, when I was in high school, The army, 
I guess that means I was happier in the Kibbutz, at school, and after the army…
I had sad moments, but I guess I had more happy moments.

If I choose happiness I choose the blue pill, I choose to have a comfy, happy life, choosing the red pill might be much harder, but it’s the truth.
If I choose the blue pill I’ll always know I’m missing out, it will probably always bother me.
So it’s not a happy life then…

I’d rather talk about minimizing pain then maximizing happiness. Because pain stays, happiness goes away at some point.



I&#39;m currently writing here, and it&#39;s a mess
Quite easily I can use code to categorize the files or paragraphs into groups
But I can not do it from here because I can not write code on the iPad
This should not be a problem
I can do ssh to some machine and work there
But there should also be a way to do it through a browser
Eclipse Che is supposed to be ide for the browser but it is not mobile friendly
For this I need to study web development
Do not know if this is my priority right now

I would like to develop
Hey whats up?
Sabba
Do I need a psychologist?
There is a situation
Good
The choice of the Ivska?
There is a situation

What else?
Working?
I need to find a project
Better something a question would be glad I do
Good
What else?
Do not know
What more?
Do not know
What about Ashley

What about Elizabeth
In the meantime it is no longer in the app
What can I do?
I have to move on with my life
What will save me?
From what?
From my life
Maybe the psychologist
Maybe
Good
What about when?
What about Ivska?
There are the books Jonathan sent me
Good
But what will I start reading a book now?
I can

Can I play a game only with the API?

Let&#39;s think of an X circle

I have to say what coordinates I play

And the page of the game will change accordingly

In summary this post is like any call to a function
This form is the parameters transmitted

And chess?
This time I choose twice from where and to where
This is basically one function

And civilization?
I choose a theme of action and a subject
There could be a number of married people I guess

But the actions vary depending on the subject
But this is already a UI problem
Logic is the same logic
The question is how much fancy form

Get to choose a topic that is simply a sequence of choices (get)
Choose a slot (place)
Each slot has themes
Every subject has actions
Each action has a subject square
Each subject slot has a marriage



If the algorithm does not work, what will I do?

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
Beauty
The one from Live Porn said she has no Skype
Forget about me a little

The other, Hannah, said she would bring me the number
As if she&#39;s cute to me
But of course
IM paying
But what to do?
Put it on WhatsApp?
I can
But if the picture is provocative it will probably raise questions
Better on Facebook
Or Instagram

Culture begins with the concept,
By naming things, so that we can contain them in our imagination

When we gave a concept for the good feeling, when we invented the concept &quot;good&quot; and therefore also &quot;bad&quot;, here we set the goal of culture, the goal of course is to avoid &quot;bad&quot; and as much as possible &quot;good&quot;
Joy and Ozer are just words that describe a good feeling
Love is a good feeling when its object is external

But basically what is a good feeling, it is impossible to define a concept in the concept itself, so a good feeling is actually a feeling that we would like to exist all the time, that is, its very existence we want to maximize,
This feeling is an interpretation of the senses, the senses perceive and so we feel, although there is also a feeling in the brain, I mean love is not exactly received in the senses, but it is an interpretation, so it goes into definition, it is just a meta interpretation, so when our senses, I find it difficult to say It limits them, but basically when the interpretation is positive we feel good,
When is the interpretation positive? If we look at the genes, then the interpretation is positive when at the moment the gene has a better chance of surviving, i.e. after we have eaten enough, after we have fucked,
But why does beauty make us feel good, what does it provide, why is symmetry or simplicity considered beautiful?
It seems to me that language once again enters the &quot;concept&quot; of interest, when as few concepts as possible describe as much of the world as possible, it&#39;s beautiful, maybe, it gives a good feeling maybe
There is the benefit of predicting the future through concepts, which actually increases our confidence so our genes are supposed to make us feel good about it

After all, animals have sex not to survive but because it feels good, which means they instinctively prevent it,

There is a very good chance that before the concept of good existed there was already the concept of bad, because bad is the generalization of our passions, hunger thirsts horny, not that they themselves are bad but they make us feel bad, when I am hungry then it bothers me until I satisfy myself, When I&#39;m horny it bothers me until I satisfy this hunger, the same with breathing, we only feel when the need is not met, I&#39;m not sure sex feels as good as it feels bad without it, although it seems to me that sex is a bit unusual in this respect because it does not feel good to breathe , Or drinking just hurts us when not, and pain is the motive, maybe the strongest as he said in the lecture to the lecturer there is nothing that motivates more than the hanging rope or something like that, even sleep, maybe there are those who do it for fun, but usually it is done out of lack of choice
It seems to me that what pain just does is overload the brain, the brain is not free to deal with other things because its attention is committed to the painful area, sometimes one pain is also harmless but accumulation can even kill pain, which is a very strange expression because what is the thing if the thing hurts You do not kill yourself, so the pain that is supposed to deter you from the painful thing in order for you to survive actually does the opposite and suddenly kills you.

Humor is a very social thing, it&#39;s just an example of creativity, of dishonest thinking, and the appreciation for it is laughter, like for example Mark&#39;s imitation, was an exaggeration, meaning I presented it in an unconventional way,
Perhaps words from the open group are vectors, and from the closed group matrices
Then a sentence like: life in the trash
Is basically:
Life
This is a function on the word life
Creates a vector
In this function on garbage
Creates a vector
Actually b
Works on both parts of the sentence
How does a matrix describe a function that receives more than one argument?
Maybe every word is a matrix
What gets a vector and returns a matrix?

structure:
Goal (deadline)
sub goal (deadline)


Is there such a thing as too politically correct
If I can not start with a girl, because as soon as she tells me no, I must stop
In general it is politically correct to lie
It does not say what you really think so as not to offend
I&#39;m in favor of lying a bit
I prefer this mask of the Californians with a fake smile over the default face of the Parisians
But is there a limit from which this is already a problem?
Maybe make meaningful connections
As if the big truth is I&#39;m in favor of it

So what&#39;s next?
Walla does not know
I&#39;m already dying to buy a house
Get some 10%
Only have to work for another 5 years

Islands need to see some 100 apartments
Make some 10 suggestions
There is a situation that is better in California
I also need to see what
The smoking yesterday gave me nothing
Maybe I&#39;m done?
So what now?
Good question
No smoking at all?
interesting
What other options are there?
Adibles?
I&#39;ll probably try Adibles next month

Why do I have to think all the time?
Because it&#39;s boring for me not to think about anything
That&#39;s the point
I need to get bored
Not thinking about anything
It&#39;s meditation

what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
What about you?
Sabba
I&#39;m a little addicted to live porn
It&#39;s nice because it&#39;s both porn and some interaction
I wanted a week off and got
But what will I do next week?
Now I can actually upload a lot of movies to YouTube
Maybe I will pay for a more powerful server for the app
what else?
what&#39;s the point?
In half a minute give a first video
And a link to YouTube
It should work 90% of the time
You also need to work on the quality of the videos
I need about ten videos a day
Write down what the problems are
Correct
Until it reaches 90% without problems

Good
What else?
Walla
I have two favorites
Ashley and Hannah
Ashley is 80 for ten minutes
Hannah 160
And I have Monday and Thursday
Saturday once or twice a month
I also want to scatter them small gifts for the week
Ashley Kiss, 15
Hannah also has something like this, if you like also some 15
Every week $ 40 is 360
That&#39;s 240 for shows and another 120 in between
I want to indulge every day for two days
This is 8 tips for both
4 to one
Yes it&#39;s every day for two days
Monday Thursday Saturday Wednesday?

Good
Or I&#39;ll buy more tokens
I can buy with PayPal 180 for $ 20
Or 200 with a credit card
I can with $ 50 520 on a card or 460 PayPal
$ 100 1080 credit or 960 PayPal
$ 200 2340 credit or 2005 PayPal
This is a difference of about 10%
Do not know if significant
Just if I buy more, I&#39;ll probably spend more too
Each jump gives 5%
It seems odd to buy $ 20 each time
Maybe it&#39;s better to put $ 200 for the whole month
And that&#39;s it
I need 360 double 4 in large it&#39;s 1440
It&#39;s $ 160 and again it&#39;s $ 180
Or I can ask for the number and pay them directly and that&#39;s it
Well let&#39;s end the month
Then 200 women will see where we get to
Better on the card
Comes out about 20 shows
When I only need about half of it
So worth it
At least try

What else?
That&#39;s all I have in mind right now
What do I want to do?
It&#39;s closest to sex
And also to human connection
that I have

This is the best attraction I have at the moment
I can go to parties
But not in Corona
And also in this with Sheeran
Good
What else?
There is no outside
Friends maybe

What to do?
I have full of things to do
There are reminders
There&#39;s asana
I have a matrix of options in Excel here
I have here on the side the tasks of Google
I have the assignments I wrote down for myself at the beginning of the year

What do I want to do?
Do not know…
If I can do what I want
what am I doing
I have a billion dollars
whip
Do not know
Why is it so hard…

First thing to unify lists

But where?
Most convenient are Apple reminders
But this is not a cross-platform
I once did this test
Still not closed on what to choose…


We spend today:
3000 on the apartment
800 on trips
400 on food
350 on groceries
300 on entertainment
300 on visibility and services
200 on transportation
150 on health
100 on gifts
That amounts to about 5600
If we go down some 1000 on the apartment, we&#39;ve turned
So what do we have
What&#39;s new?
Everything turned around, not bad
I was quite able to do what I wanted quite elegantly at work.
I could have done it faster but it was not easy.

Besides it still sucks that I&#39;m not a qualified investor because I have not earned 200,000 in the last two years
I think there&#39;s probably a way around this if I&#39;m making a profit,
But I still do not know if it will really hurt me in any way.
I&#39;m doing this real estate course
Do not know if it gives anything
Ultimately what needs to be checked is the assumptions of their model, and the team.
I can compare it to other opportunities I see and see if it really is a bargain.
This is what else מזה
Monday I will work from home
Hope it will be nice
Maybe i should do a massage
What more
Do not know
I talked to Ziv was nice
Difficult relationship
Especially with a child
Hard boy
Why it&#39;s hard in a relationship
It&#39;s not supposed to be that way
We also have no pressure at all as men
What about happiness
Sela did not come back to me about what I had written for him, that in life he needs all the flavors, both joy and sadness, all the rainbow of emotions.

There are 400 different odor receptors
Compared to 3 color receptors (and there are also black and white)
And 2 taste receptors (sweet and bitter) although there are 5 basic flavors (sour and omami salty)
And one audio receiver



What do I do with my life?

I want to make this thing work.
How do I know it works?
The expectation looks good, how do I know what the risk is?
The Worst Case Scenario does not scare me
If I lose everything I gained, it will bother me.
But this is not the Worst Case, I can also equally say that I should not get in a car. I need to look at 3 standard deviations below average.
It&#39;s like tossing a coin
What is the standard deviation of the trinity?
What is a standard deviation?
The root of variance
What is different
The span of the centered variable square
In fact, this standard deviation is the average of the distances from the average
So what is the average of the distances of coin tossing?
If a tree is one and a 1-fold then the average is one, no?
E[x]=P(-1)*-1+p(1)*1=0
E [(XE [x]) ^ 2] = p (-1) * - 1 ^ 2 + p (1) * 1 ^ 2 = 0.5
s[x]=sqrt(0.5)= 0.7


Hey whats up?
Sabba
What about you?
OK
Another fun day with Ashley
Atonement for her
What a cute thing
I do not know what to do
But in the meantime there is nothing to do
I&#39;ll try to really meet her
we will see what will be
What else?
Ok I updated the computer
Looks like maybe this will help with the problems I&#39;ve had
What else?
It was a nice lecture
The part with the change in US hegemony as soon as they entered Iraq
Interesting section
But it&#39;s probably China related too
Began to leap
And now there is not just one force that rules
Good
What else?
This is Please Arf
A lawyer needs to be found to handle the matter of a prenuptial agreement
What more?
Need to get a license
Okay
Something else?
Do not know
Maybe next week
That&#39;s enough for now
Okay
Yes
At work we are divided
My dream of moving to research is receding
Also the part of engaging in computational learning
It&#39;s a basa
I need to talk about this with these
Yes
Well what else?
This is my brother
You finished me. We finished twenty things in five minutes
Short and sweet
But now what do I do?
Want to see another episode of Power and Rule?
Yes you can…
Beauty
Come on cute
cute?
What about a stripper?
Yes it&#39;s at the end of the month
Or another week or two
Okay
Probably the next weekend or one after that
Good
And this is not a betrayal of Ashley
Do not know
Ashley is already a kind of infidelity
Do not know
hard to say
But what do you do with it
I do not want to hurt Sheeran
But I also do not want to hurt me
Yes
It is important
Good
What else?
Do not know
What about you?
Walla
Want to meet someone who sucks?
I thought of traveling for when
And Ivasca
But it&#39;s a mess

The whole day is wasted
See videos on YouTube
The truth is that the majority are interesting
But how would I rather spend the day
If I had the strength to do what I wanted
What would I do
I would probably be sitting on the project
I have to make it work
Or proceed to the next project
I need financial independence
I do not want to have to go to work
I need a million dollars
2 million so that Sheeran won&#39;t have to work either

I need to concentrate my investments
I have money in Mellanox - maybe 50,000
I have another 50,000 in the account at Leumi
And another 100,000 in the account at hsbc
I also have money in etrade

So what&#39;s going through my mind?
What always goes through, is that I want to be free, for that I need a million dollars, that&#39;s all
I believe I can get there in 14 years, if I put enough aside and invest the money
I would have been happy if it had happened before, with some startup or something

what else?
I would like to know how to develop applications (web, Android, iPhone)

what else?
I want to die
Peace of worlds no?

I do not know, I have nothing in mind

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Bummer
Just sitting at home doing nothing
Another Day
I have no power
so what are we doing?
is nothing
Oops


It really seems like I had the most success in August
They all flew at me
And today only one to… flew over me
Do not know what happened
I also do not have pictures from August to know what was
In short, when I had full hair, I was not particularly attractive
But when I downloaded it I got a lot of positive feedback
Basically the first was a keyboard that was worth the most that flew over me
And Lisa&#39;s brother flew over me too
By and large until recently, it was kind of half and half those who flew and those who did not
But now it already feels like it is leaning in the non-direction
I was with about January 7th and only one seemed interested
Which is the opposite of August
Do not know what happened in this half year
Even less than four months
Good
what else?
Do not know
What do I have to do this week?
I could not find a therapist
I did not start the financial agreement
I need Sheeran&#39;s IDs
I&#39;ll do it
What more?
full
There are things to learn
Course in communication, course in psychology
Language, statistics
Need to take care of my license
And there are things of money
Investments, taxes, pension real estate, contributions
Where do you start?
Besides, I wanted to analyze everything I write
And a dentist
What to do?
What is most important
Couples therapy and financial agreement
Dude?
Basically taxes, do not know how much it will help
So what
Maybe invest?
Taxes can help me with a third of my income
That&#39;s a lot
But only up to about 50 thousand
That&#39;s a lot
So that would help in about $ 15,000
Which is less than 10% of income
If in investments I make another 10% it is worth more
Yes
What more?
Real estate, take care of insurance
To do refinance, I tried and did not work
Maybe I should just sell this property
Maybe go to cpa

lots of things
How to prioritize?
Learn something…
This is less important than other arrangements
But perhaps it is possible at the same time
Maybe
how?
You can do a few lessons a week
3 lessons suppose
When?
Instead of code questions maybe
Maybe
Good
Maybe I need an annual plan
Yes
Maybe look at what the plan was last year, and if I met the goals
Yes

what&#39;s going on?
Everything is fine
A little pissed that tomorrow I have to work on this uninteresting project
I&#39;ll try to finish it, but I do not think I will do the second part of it
Good
I think two projects and two courses is a spin
I think I can also double that
But it&#39;s a turn to leave a free space
Good
What more?

I would be happy if I had a better platform for tasks
I tried asana
But there is nothing to do it is not as convenient as reminders
do not know why
Maybe it&#39;s a matter of habit
But also sharing
Although I have no problem leaving what is common in reminders
Good
then what
Is it a gamification?
Do not know
What do you need for gameification?
Small goals and positive reinforcements
Do not know if there is it in the asana and calendar
I should do one maybe
Although its name is already a positive reinforcement
I received a whole email or notification from the app
Good
What else?
Do not know
Why is it so hard to find a task management app?
Just sucks that there are several different places for the same thing
Reminders, asana, email


I need order
In a rough division you can write:
Of money
medicine
food
transportation
residence
(dressed)
Entertainment
information
The conscious mind notices what is most disturbing (?)
Is it impossible to be aware of something positive?
When I am happy am I aware?

information:
What / who
Where / When - (place / time)
Why / How - (Reason / Way)
Which

I want to arrange information
What bothers me?
I have no passive income


To do a gamification
Need to break down a goal into small tasks
Recursively
Until you reach an action that can be performed in one run

So basically for any purpose:
Division into tasks
Weight for each task

For example:
Cleaning the house
Arrangement - 10
Services - 30
Kitchen for, - 30
Bedroom - 10
Living room - 10
Arrangement
Services - 25
Kitchen - 25
Bedroom - 25
Living room - 25
And so on

So for a million dollars
Start-up - 32
Work - 40
start up
Diphtheria
Working
Save NIS 8,000 a month
Earn 4% per annum
Hey
what&#39;s going on?
All is well
I&#39;m dying to see Hannah
And Ashley, too
I do not know what to do
I was dying to meet them once
Know if this is it
How do you know?
I guess it&#39;s something you feel
And let&#39;s say this, what about Sheeran?
Do not know
It seems to me to flow
What will be will be
In things of good and evil there is no right or wrong
In the end it comes from the culture and inside
There are my desires and there are the desires of culture
I guess I will not do to anyone what I would not want him to do to me
Wouldn&#39;t I want to be betrayed?
I guess
But do not know if I would rather have them leave me
But am I not leaving?
Probably leaving would have hurt me
But what if staying hurts me
Can I be with more than one woman?

I guess a family takes half the time like that
So maybe I can raise two families, but then I have no time at all
If you break up then by and large I get the kids half the time, that means a quarter of the time
But it requires separation
It is also an economic issue
Half goes to a woman
And even more so if it&#39;s kids
If she earns as much as I do, then there is no problem
It just depends on the time of custody

Well it&#39;s irrelevant now
Let&#39;s hope I can get into the country at all

What else?
Was nice in the country
It was mostly fun with the stallions
But it&#39;s hard like that
The flight is difficult, get divorced
It&#39;s a lot of effort to see them all
Was weird with Yaron
Bummer
I was happy to see Mickey and Ron
Besides it seems to me I have seen the majority
Eyal Barak would not have come just for me
Getting away has nothing to do

So I got quite a lot of good luck
But do not know if it will continue like this
It&#39;s a kind of transition phenomenon
I get a little here and a little away
what can we do
I try to be around everyone
Max found new

What else?
I have a full time job
But the intern is leaving this week
Was a nice project
It&#39;s not over yet
But maybe now that I have no hazel, I can just take a week off
Maybe Labor Day
There&#39;s this thing that Jonathan&#39;s friend is organizing
Will probably be nice

What else?
This
What more
The project was a bit in the making
Maybe I should go back to it

So what did you want to talk about?
Do not know, just, talk
What?
mere
What does that just mean
Tachles does not know
So why do it?
Tachles does not know…
So maybe not?
Why not
Walla, do not know…
exactly
I need to find an investment property
I might be able to use some api
I need to add information of the increase in the value of the apartment
I need to communicate with agents
Best if I could get from realtor.com the information about median rent and median apartment price on all regions in America

To do the calculation I need
The price of the apartment - zillow
Rental price - zillow
Vacancy rate - factfinder
Expenses - factfinder
tax
Repairs
Insurance
Value increase - zillow
Talk to agents
Talk to the bank



What do I do now when I&#39;m with Sheeran
How do I continue to study?
I can on evenings when I have no goblins go for coffee
But it&#39;s only two evenings
On weekends as long as there is no plan I can go for coffee
This is 3-4 times a week
Every day I have 3 segments of about 4 hours of work
Until lunch
Until dinner
Until bedtime
A total of 21 sections per week of 84 hours
About 84-90 segments a month of about 360 hours
About 1100 sections per year of about 4400 hours
10 of the weekly sessions go to work
I also do not count sleep that is equivalent to two sections a day
I was left with 11 sections for me and Sheeran
It sounds reasonable to me to give Shiran 6
I can make the hazelnuts of the palms, make one in the weekend
Then 3 times go for coffee
Once more twice a weekend
Sounds reasonable
Each section in a cafe costs about $ 7
This means that this week it comes out ~ $ 30-35,
$ 120-150 ~ in about a month
Not a little at all

So what do I do
I have a lot of projects
Invest in housing
Deepmoney
Qordr
The experiment in physics
I need to relax
I also need to correct Sheeran the blessing that will come out better
Besides I also work…
There is also the section of egg freezing that will take time
And in general bringing a child is a sea of work
I&#39;m a little drowning in all this
I also want to make music
I want too many things

Deepmoney has a 1 in 10 chance of turning me into a multi-millionaire to a billionaire (like Buffett)
Qordr has a 1 in 10 chance of turning me into a multi-millionaire (like Tomer)
Housing has a pretty high chance of making me a millionaire
The experiment in physics could bring me a Nobel Prize
Also need to weigh what I enjoy

Qordr is less interesting to me
Also need to weigh what I need
In order to be free I need about a million dollars

Well then what do I have to do
housing:
Buy his book and read - a week
Talk to agents here in the area - two hours
Talk to agents in Florida - two hours
Talk to banks about financing - two hours
Analyze 100 opportunities - 80 hours
Deepmani
What they sent by mail - 8 hours
Do the rnn course when it comes out - a week
Assemble a system from 0 - week
Quarter
Talk to a friend of Ben Zrihan&#39;s - an hour
Try to publish the system with the clearing - 12 hours
Try to use Faber&#39;s advertising - 4 hours
physics
Calculate the probabilities of the particles passing through each side - 4 hours
Use a more reliable simulator - 12 hours
Figs
Peymank
Unity
What of all this do I want to do?

I will do the minimum necessary to advance in the secondary projects (Deepmani, Quarter and Physics)
The rest of the time will be devoted to the main project currently being real estate investment

To produce wheat you need ±120 days of sun.
The sun gives ±1000W/m^2.
m^2 produces ±330g of wheat.
1000W*10h=10kWh
10kWh/d*120d=1200kWh~=4500MJ
330g*1369kJ/100g~=4500kJ
The efficiency of wheat is ±1/1000

So
Again
6 years
I need ±600k
This should get me 60k a year
From which I should get 48k or 4k a month
If I want 5k like I spend right now, I should have 800k and take 80k
This is given I am making 10% on my investment
Might have to save for 2 more years to get to 1M
Right now looks like I can make it to 600k in 5 years, 700k in 6, 850 in 7 and 1M in 8
But I think I’ll retire in 5, and then take a year off or something to see how that is.
I think after retiring I’ll still make money, because I’ll be productive
So it’s a bit less than 5 years, 4 and 8 months right now until I’m 29
So in 6 months it’s be 50m away, which is approx 100 paychecks = 200w ~= 4 years
That’s not too bad
I’m getting 40k a year (before taxes) from the bonus, meaning around 26k net, and then 18k from 401k, and 11.5% ~= 14.5k before tax which is 10k net from espp, total of 54k saving
133k+40k=173k, 
Tax ~50k, saving ~54k, spending 70? I’m probably spending a bit more than 60, so saving is maybe 1k more (last year I earned ~150k, so i didn’t save that 10k, but maybe this year)


A container is divided into two
On one side large and slow and small and fast particles
An empty second side
The partition moves only small particles (like a strainer)
So at the end on one side the speed is higher
Entropy went down without investing energy
The transition can be made asymmetrical, for example a lot of holes on one side that merge except for holes on the other side

I found a purpose
Minimize the amount of time I think about money
first question:
So it&#39;s not better not to think about it, because I&#39;ll end up thinking about money
But maybe it will save such thoughts in the future
Here it is two different voices in the same brain
Why is this interesting to me?


2 types of happiness
Momentary and continual.
Momentary like eating or sex or drugs, where doing more of it, just makes you want to do it more. If you starve it you’re full and if you fill it you starve.
Continual happiness comes from being present, from being in a state of flow, where you are fully immersed in the experience you’re having.
To be in a state of flow you need 2 things:
A task that is interesting and challenging in the right amount
Skills that are high enough for the task.
There are two signals:
Change (dopamine)
Sign (positive or negative) (opioid)

What is a positive sign? Lack of negative sign
In fact we constantly owe a negative sign that our nerves are constantly firing, either from sitting on a chair, or lying in bed.
Once we are relieved by these signs, a kind of numbness we feel &quot;good&quot;.

According to this, when we are confident in the bathroom that we feel nothing, we are supposed to feel better than in sex.
Maybe because in the bath we only lose sensation in the outer cells but not in the inner cells.

According to this under general anesthesia we are supposed to feel best.
Maybe because under anesthesia we also numb the area that feels (which receives this input)

According to this if we find anesthesia the whole body and not the brain we will feel best.
Maybe because inside the brain is the mechanism that constantly fires that simulates a negative feeling and it does not stop firing even when the body is asleep.

So if we find a way to silence him we can feel good all the time.
By and large this is what opioids do, but they create dependency.
Maybe dependence is just an outgrowth of a good feeling over time.
Maybe because you have to change all the time.

So the mechanism is just negative, why do living things not commit suicide?
Because apparently death hurts. Everything that brings us closer to death, hurts us, and it teaches us that death probably hurts.

All in all, we are trying to minimize the pain in our lives.
The problem is that the mechanism works in pulses, so to minimize pain we can only create pulses of &quot;joy&quot; (lack of pain)


extremistan: a system in which low probability event is proportional to a power of it's size (power law) 
mostly cultural systems (economy, politics...) but also the weather
weather can be forcasted to some level using numerical results of the primitive equations (like momentum conservation, energy conservation, flow continuity...) along with noble gas law.
 what if we can find same equations for culture, or information
for information I believe that it could be treated with statistical rules applied to statistical mechanics, using terms like enthropy


I do not know what to do with the game
On the one hand I want something to be a simulation of the real world
And on the other hand I want something playful
One more important
I can divide the government as seen in the OECD
Defense - Military
פנים - policing, emergency management, national security, supervision of local governments, conduct of elections, public administration and immigration matter
Foreign - Diplomacy
Culture -
Education
health
אוצר - of government finance, fiscal policy, and financial regulation

And what does everyone do?
 
Maybe it&#39;s better to start from the bottom
The daily life of an individual
Like The Sims
But more real
I know on average how much is invested in each area

It really bothers me that Alex treats me unpleasantly
It makes you not want to work with him
But I do not know what to do with it
options:
tell him
Pros:
Not behind the back
Maybe there is behavior
Disadvantages:
May make the situation worse
Tell Sashin
Pros:
Perhaps a stronger impact
Disadvantages
May come back to me like a boomerang
Write him a negative review
Benefits
There may be a strong effect
Disadvantages

is nothing
Benefits
easy
Disadvantages
Nothing will change

What about Sheeran?
options:
leave
Benefits
freedom
Disadvantages
Hurt her
Stay and betray
Benefits
Kind of freedom…
Disadvantages
May harm her
Stay and be loyal
Benefits
Does not harm her
Disadvantages
No freedom - hurts me
To leave after giving birth
Benefits
Does not create a situation that she does not have children (and me)
Disadvantages
May harm the child
It may be harder to leave

If time is only present in thermodynamics, which also relates to computation, maybe we can see the future because p!=np
Can we have a time invariant Turing machine? Can we have a time invariant neural net? Learning requires time to pass.
So can we relate entropy to computation? To np  problems?
Entropy is related to information, there’s a limitation on the amount of information required to reduce entropy.
This is related to the Landauer limit

Hey whats up?
Everything is fine
They did not return to me even today
We dropped to 53%
Oops
It seems to me that it is especially difficult with the uncertainty…
Not that it means I want certainty at the price of no
I prefer not to come back to me than to come back to me with no…
Although how long will I wait before I turn to them?
a month?
Yes, it&#39;s hard to know,
I probably will not return to them
Good
What else?
Lisa was this morning
Like she said…
What can I do…
Bummer
Oops
There are a lot of beautiful girls on this site
And I do not think there is only one like her
There is something but in that she is not spreading
I guess she does it because she has a small breast
She&#39;s not perfect
nobody is perfect
I was dying to do it
I would marry her?
Do not know
If she has a good character
Since when does the good character segment come in?
My ideology is if I&#39;m sexually attracted to her, then come on
So what has changed?
There are things in nature that interfere
I can not be shouted at
What else?
Someone you can count on was nice
Not someone who will say what suits her
By and large there is a question here of whether I would have been her friend if she had been a son
interesting
Or a roommate
Tachles at first she was really comfortable
Slowly it is more and more like a flower in camouflage
It sucks a little
Good
What else?
Do not know
I did not progress in the task that was dropped on me
Hope tomorrow
It seems to me that I pretty much finished what I wanted to accomplish this week
Maybe I&#39;ll go for an escort tomorrow
Maybe
Well what else?
Do not know
what do you want to do?
Basically I am supposed to do a project and a course
I did a project, it was the attempt to get accepted to Google
Course…
Yes
Well I added some videos to the YouTube list
seen
What else?
Not too much
project?
Raise the brain to the cloud
What to do?
Maybe read a little about Halo

Hey whats up?
Sabba
What about you?
OK
My principal dropped me off on a project that did not interest me
I do not know if it is good or bad
See you tomorrow
I have a day of interviews on Google
we will see what will be
I do not have to make System Design seem to me
Maybe I should ask for more confidence
But yes one has to go through computational learning
Do not know exactly what to go through
Good
I will look for as much as possible
What else?
A corner of a financial agreement needs to be closed
Just being dragged
Good
What else?
Maybe we&#39;ll drive to Lugas
Maybe
What else?
Do not know
Maybe we should go through Google&#39;s email?
Maybe
Good
What else?
Do not know
there&#39;s nothing
I have no power
enough
That&#39;s over already
Fucking work
All our lives we practice for this shit
If
Good
What else?
Do not know
What else?
Sheeran in circulation
Next week must probably have sex
A week later I am free again
Although now I&#39;m a little disgusted by it
Well, I do not have to do that
Good
What more
tell me
I have no strength to sing
I want to be alone
I do not know what to do
Good

When there will be 100K bytes (1000 ^ 2 bytes) then basically it will be twice 300 ^ 2 and not once

A player can move in 4 directions and will probably finish in 64 steps
The board can move in 4 directions for 6 dice (24 ~ 32 directions) probably within 24 ~ 32 steps
So we have a total
4 ^ 64 = 2 ^ 2*64 = 2 ^ 128
32 ^ 24 = 2 ^ 5*24 = 2 ^ 120


if corner and a box is not on target

What&#39;s going on here
So I give weight to everything I want to do


What do I care what is right and what is wrong, I should care what is right for me, completely subjective, if I feel it then for me it exists
Maybe for communication, for me to be able to speak objectively so that everyone understands me, to communicate with others,

Did the culture start with &quot;concept&quot; or &quot;good versus bad&quot;
What&#39;s good or bad, it&#39;s completely subjective, but it&#39;s a way of culture to preserve itself, do not kill, it&#39;s not good for culture because it will contain fewer people and thus weaken
But good and bad were before that because since time immemorial the genes dictate to us what is good and what is bad, after all every living thing knows that fucking and eating is good and getting hurt and dying is bad, so once we started to conceive of everything we also had to name maybe these feelings
But why read by name? To improve communication, because better communication means a stronger tribe, means less danger to the garden
Good and evil are already concepts, so I guess concepts preceded good and evil, when did they start? When a person had time to ask the question, when he did not bother all day with survival perhaps?
So communication through concepts made us stronger, and the concepts themselves began to control us as genes began to control the material that creates them,

What do I care?
Because I care why I ask questions or what we have besides animalism what is culture, where does it lead
So what now?
Quantopian
What do I want?
How will I feel good on Monday?
What is the goal?
What do I enjoy?
I would like to enjoy development in language processing
How do you get to this point?
I need a course like this
Or a project at the end of which I already know how to develop

What else can be done
What do I want?
escape
ססעמק

Hey whats up?
Sabba
Sunday back to work
A short week
Also next week
It&#39;s nice
Not that I have too many plans
okay, well
What are the options?
Do not know
I still do not feel anything
We&#39;ll see what the doctor says
What else?
Not too much
I did c2c today with two girls who did not flatter me
Maybe I should get a haircut
Maybe it&#39;s the mood
Do not know
On Tuesday I actually received a compliment
But Latin
Russians a little less flattering
Less emotion shows
okay, well
What about a stripper?
I have the week to order one
I can really bring that one up
I can
Good
What else?
Not too much
Sheeran extended in a few days
does not bother me
Maybe a little because it&#39;s just another proof that she prefers her parents over me
Mostly her dad
That I must point out that I do not particularly like
And it&#39;s a little stressful for me that she&#39;s like him
what can we do
Financial agreement…
okay, well
What else?
I talked to Sela a bit
Do not know what he has
Did not cooperate too much
Do not know what the point
As if he&#39;s saying he&#39;s kicking me but not acting like that
Sabba
Not critical
I&#39;m a little upset that I&#39;m not going on vacation with Jonathan&#39;s girlfriend
Maybe they&#39;re people around
I need to expand the circle
What it needs
Need nothing
Corona too and that
But just might be nice if I have someone to talk to
I tried to see if I had anything to talk about in Reddit
But I did not find too much there
What will I also talk about
I have no problem talking to myself
Like I thought I was talking about philosophy
But in essence, I can just &quot;talk&quot; about it with Google
I do not have any topic that interests me at the moment
My energy level is pretty low
Hope I&#39;m not sick of something
And if so it is reversible
okay, well
We will wait for the doctor
What else?
That&#39;s it, please
I do not have too much
Want to meditate?
okay, well
What will I do when Sheeran is here?
Maybe meditation with Um
If she hears out loud, so do I.

So what does rock mean?
There is no free choice
It does not matter that there is an illusion of choice
We are made of shields
And water
Our values stem from our genes and memes
We&#39;re like Hamlet talking about Shakespeare
We are not capable
Because we are cement
We are characters in the story
We can not talk meta

In my opinion and more how is it possible
We may be limited in our brain capacity
But I think in principle, our ability to calculate is unlimited
In principle, infinite computing power can solve any problem
Except for the stopping problem, I guess
We are of course limited to our brain
But as a collective, we are limited to the language we speak
And it may not be limited
And anyway we can create a computer with infinite computing power
Well he will probably be final
Can we eventually produce a computer that can predict all the events?
First of all it is limited in the amount of makeup it has
Because information advances at the speed of light

In fact, maybe that&#39;s not the question
The conclusion of the book is that nothing matters
Just as God is an illusion
Happiness is also an illusion
It&#39;s an abstract noun we invented
Nothing matters objectively
It makes sense that importance or value is a subjective thing

I tend to disagree
That nothing matters
There are things that are subjectively important (obviously)
Like food or sex

I agree that nothing is objectively important
By and large this is from the definition of important
Important is something we give high value to
Without us nothing matters or does not matter
Okay
But we exist
There is a subject
And I have what is important and not important to me
And if it&#39;s important to me to be happy
So that&#39;s what&#39;s important to me

Society is also an organism
So it is important for her to survive
So it is important for society not to fade
And not to get into chaos
The idea is to reach equilibrium I guess
To a steady state

We are largely animals
So with food and sex we were supposed to have a spin
But we have more than that
We have boredom
We need to dispel it all the time

We are not the programmers
We are the program
And therefore we can not understand ourselves

I do not agree with the claim
Is it impossible to write a program that will understand its own code?

I do not feel the desire to learn
I want to want to study but am afraid I want to do it not for myself but for the culture, because I am actually a small screw in it, and it forces me to go its own way
Come on what comes to mind today I sat like many last days like a zombie, yesterday I read a whole book, and not an easy book, about the genes why because it interested me I had a question I wanted to answer, or the concept of selfish gene explained me a lot mainly I remember interested me about Memes, why because I try to understand what attracts in learning what sets us apart from the rest and in my opinion the answer to this matter is the concept &quot;concept&quot;, the idea or maybe actually the concept is an idea what is a concept, I got it and now it is in my head or at least has its representation In my head how they came up with the idea of evolution if you still do not know what exactly life is, how do you know physics if no one has a clear idea what matter is, it is the idea once you have an idea in your head you can explore it and break it down into components but why Not build? It&#39;s order, it&#39;s the idea of order they say that awareness is the ability to arrange things to reduce entropy, where did the concept of number come from, it&#39;s a very common feature, there used to be people with a lot of sheep and wanted to know who has more sheep. If they are three and we two have a better chance of overcoming us, maybe that&#39;s where the idea of a number came from or if we grew so and so grain and everyone needed so and so, then the grain will suffice for this and so time, number is a generalization of quantity, which is a concept in itself there are tribes That they have one my heart concept two and a lot, and that&#39;s it their math, with that more than two it&#39;s a lot, the theory of logic which itself investigates the truths of indications about concepts once you try to formulate a rule to make order, you can test it by your assumptions Assumptions but concepts
Hi
How are you?
Ok
What’s on your mind?
Nothing
Nothing?
I think so
Ok, what would you like to do?
I don’t know
If money wasn’t a problem what would you do right now?
Probably order food
If nothing was a problem, no limits, what would you do?
Fly
What would you do if you only had physical limits
Sex with Bar Rafaeli
And then?
Run for president
What would you do if you only had physical and law limits
Are law limits that strict?
I can’t be president
I can make fake credentials and stuff
I probably won’t though
What else?
I would create an intelligent machine
I have to gamify my life
Break it down to steps.
Each day try to complete a step.
Until the whole thing is complete.

So how do you know all the steps in advance?
How do you even know how many are there?

So I want to build a intelligent machine.
How do you do that?
Well, you need computation power for that.
How do I imagine this thing?
A model that gets input (text/photo/video), and provides output (text, silence, maybe action)
So it’s basically a machine learning model.
I need to find the state of the art right now.
I need to identify what’s missing
I need to help bring what’s missing.
Repeat until goal is achieved.
Ok so first step is find SOTA
2 identify weakness
Fix weakness
Repeat
That doesn’t sound so hard…
What about the money project?
Good question…
What do I prefer to do:
Build an intelligent machine?
Build a trading machine
Well the intelligent machine will also a good trader probably, but it will take much longer - 
I’ve been working almost 4 years on the trading machine... 
Another approach
Through Apple

Siri Research


So I&#39;m currently working on some of the projects it looks like
There&#39;s qordr where I care to work on it
There&#39;s the deepmoney, which I worked on for over a year without too many results
I can not even find a correlation between a change in price and p / e

If you want to address inequality you just have to open schools that teach code
The problem is that the range to profitability is really long
At least 12 years
Maybe enough from high school
Then it&#39;s 6
Still a lot
Although most startups talk about such a range
This is not a startup
But it can be
What about an online school
To learn code there is the Litcode
Why not do Litcode
Why does such racism bother me?
Because it&#39;s full of news
But it&#39;s not just racism
It is also related to education
Everyone should have the same starting point, it&#39;s good for the economy too

If I spend $ 50 a month
It&#39;s 50 * 12 a year
If I do 12 percent, it&#39;s like one percent a month
So I need 50 * 100 for it
$ 5,000
It&#39;s another it&#39;s another month of work or so
Do not know if it is worth it
I also do not do 12%
Maybe half of it
Then it&#39;s two months of work
30 days for 40 years of 12 days of freedom
What a 500 day
Equal?
Do not know
I will not have to retire because I will probably be home alone most of the time
Shorter does not know if I would work two months for it
How much would I work for it?
A safe day
Week, it seems to me yes
Month do not know
A year seems to me not
And what about a prostitute?
Whore this month is another year or so
sounds logical
And what about porn is another half year
It also seems to me a spin
This is my hobby

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
All is well
What about you?
On the roof I can talk to myself
Also in the hotel room
Well let&#39;s do it
Too bad I do not have an iPad and charger

Hey whats up?
Sabba
What about you?
Sabba
What&#39;s new
Lisa today was about two hours (at least) with the Englishman
Sucks
With me, she usually stops after about half an hour
Okay
What else?
I told the boss that I did not know what to do with the project that had fallen on me
we will see what will be
I had pretty good results in some experiment
It&#39;s a spin
What more?
Do not know
What about you?
Do not know
What to do with couple therapy?
I turned to them, if they did not answer by tomorrow evening I would turn to Apple
If there is nothing to do, we will look for another service
There should be something at a normal price
Good
Financial agreement
I need photos of the IDs
What else?
Do not know
Taxes?
Investments?
Examination of last year&#39;s expenses?

I register only because of the sign from the rose, which did not close immediately, after I remembered to keep most of the roses I closed earlier, I did not close the acronym and in fact I did not save any changes.
So I apologize in advance if it&#39;s retarded
Okay this is a lack of confidence that comes after you&#39;re sure you&#39;ve got something big
And that&#39;s exactly the wave I&#39;m talking about,
Everything is a wave in our thinking as well
The wave that goes up when we are creatively unique and goes down when we want to be like everyone else to communicate with everyone,
When people try to be too creative then they push it too much digging into what is called as I do now, so they also fall deep back into insecurity
The way to get to the Equal Valley is to trust the name to do what it needs to do, and then get to the resonant frequency and not try too hard and on the other hand try not to be like everyone else too much (this is what leads to insecurity
It also reminds me of the theory that everyone&#39;s size is 1 and only our projection on culture varies from one to another, but those whose projection on culture is low are the ones who can pull the so-called highest string, dig the deepest in their resonance
To release is to flow, and to pull at that string on the one hand to try to dig to reach some conclusion that will shock the world from selfish ego pride and on the other hand it is this side of culture to be very cultural in thinking
It&#39;s weird because when you release you become the most creative, but when you pull the string it&#39;s because you try to be the most creative
So release my brother stop writing, in resuscitation
 
Well, it&#39;s hard for me to shake off this desire to write, which seems to me to come from the desire to live forever, or create something that will stay after, like the urge to have a child, which comes because it&#39;s better for survival, so culture bastardizes those who remember forever, Because it is better for the survival of the culture
The ones who are remembered the farthest are the ones who lay the foundations of culture, in our society it is Abraham Moses Jesus, and also Socrates Plato Aristotle, all these are philosophers, I am not sure everyone knows who they are, our culture is instant meaning the heroes are living now, or not Long ago, like the Beatles or Britney Spears
They sacrifice the high climb in the cultural strings, meaning they sacrifice influence in favor of popularity, they could have been higher and more influential if they had not sought the material, because that&#39;s how it is, it&#39;s like two opposites feeding each other, the material and the spirit, you ascend spiritually and then With your impact you can get more material
Sometimes you want to give up eternal life to get more now, and sometimes the other way around
I unload the stella a bit
The law of paradox: A certain choice is correct if the other choice leads to a paradox
For example if I believe that in order to develop a theory I have to let go and not try to develop it by force, then the only option is to let go, because if I want to develop the theory I have to let go, because the theory says that is how I will develop it, and on the other hand if I do not want to develop it then I will release anyway
Or if you believe that in order to get a girl you have to release then the only option is to release, because if you want her then you have to release, and if you do not want her then you will release anyway
On the other hand one should not believe in these beliefs in the first place
Connects me here to the theory that women are the second class after leaders and before leaders
It&#39;s chauvinistic, but it also works the opposite. There are women who lead, but a little less, and women who are led but less,
The more indifferent a man is to women in the short term the more women he will have in the long run, the more indifferent he is the more philosophical, or something like that the more he influences culture he is more a leader, on the other hand the more conformist to culture he is less sought after, he is more controlled By the women, but he has more friends
It&#39;s a little weird how these theories come up after I smoke no?
Another point: every contrast is something that also has a contrast, for example animal and cultural are opposites but both are opposite of indifference
How do I know what&#39;s right?
What do I know?
What I decide
I have a feeling I&#39;m just deciding when to release, I mean if I dig something, I can just decide to stop or continue, if I continue I&#39;m stretching the string
The most influential in the culture are those who have pulled the string the farthest, and released
Like in a minefield when something fits a lot of things you knew then it&#39;s probably true
Morality - good and bad, logic - true false, metaphysics - there is none
There is good right, there is no bad wrong
Ok
So what now?
I can keep working on the deep money 
Is it still interesting to me?
I believe it is
Any other way to make money?
What about an nlp application?
Well, the news sentiment is nlp but doesn’t currently work 
I can try to replicate the guys stock prediction work…
That looks pretty promising…
But it’s not really nlp, or is it? There may have been some news features, might be a good way to improve upon it
Another thing would just think of some nlp application I can work on, that I could someday create a business out off.
But what application?
How would I benefit from having an nlp application?
What pain point I have that can be solved by using some nlp?
What are my pain points?
Mainly the fact I need to work,
Also that I can’t fuck whoever I want…
Maybe politics is a pain point?
I mean it’s not really disturbing me that much, but some of my time and energy goes to that…
What about creating that super intelligent being?
I could work on that…
The pain point is death
And having a machine that is super intelligent might help.
One way is to get it to think of a way to avoid death.
Though I have an idea.
I want to upload my brain to the cloud.
The problem here is hardware.
I need a way to communicate with my neurons one by one…
Can a machine help improve the hardware?
A physical machine maybe, but probably not a virtual one.
First step might be to augment the brain.
Connect something to it that extends my cognition.
We can already somewhat enhance our cognition, for example by adding sensors to the skin, but this is a one way communication.
We can’t tell anything to the sensors. What happens if we do the same with neurons?
I don’t think there’s currently a way to activate single neurons.
I wonder if that’s important, what if we activate a large number of neurons?
What is the level of activation we can achieve today?
If I want a 2 way communication without touching any neurons, that by using muscles. What are some disposable muscles in the body?
I can use the pinky for example.
So what about a machine that helps me play chess by using the pinky?
What is the resolution of thought? I probably have tons of neurons going to and from my pinky. If I use them to communicate to a neural network, what happens?


What now?
Do not know…
what do you want?
Do not know…
If you had all the money in the world what would you do?
Do not know…
Think…
I have no idea…
What do I want?
I might have supported Elon Musk&#39;s company, helping with the brain

What about investing in a startup
How to invest?
There are all kinds of platforms
It may be possible to invest in a VC fund
You can invest in a crowd fund

I can look at how big investors are:

Task management

What am I doing with my life?
I need 4-5 year to retire it seems
I’m making 170k± paying 30% tax, say 50k, living on 60, saving 60.
I need to get 600k to live off of. 
I have ±160k right now. I should have 200 by next May, 300 by the following July 400 by the following august, 500 the year after that, and 600 the year after that. That’s a year before I’m 40, hopefully, if everything goes well.
If we have 60 to live off of, we’re paying ±10 for taxes I think. Then we have 50 a year that’s ±4 a month. Should be enough for a good life. Probably not in SF.

If I get a job that pays 300k, I get 200k, still living on 60k, saving 140k, that’s like saving 2.3 times more. I should get to 600 in 2-3 years from now. So that’s 2 years difference. Almost half the time. Which is nice.


So we&#39;re here and it&#39;s already clear
But what do you do from here?
What do you do from there?
Who are the people who put this in writing
Who are the people who take this off the record
Why would they do that
where are we going?
Where are we not going?
And where do we come from?
From the belly of history
And get her out of the glass
What is the appropriate word?
And a garden?
Every moment is a birth
Every moment is death
All the moments and none of them
Who are the people who do not think that way
Who are the people?
What it means
What is
what

Hey whats up?
All is well
What about you?
Sabba
I need to get ready for Google
And do not know so how
I know how to prepare for code questions
I do not know how to prepare for the question of system design
To the question of language processing
And to the question of Googles

Hi what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
Sheeran got mad at me for imitating her
Do not understand why
She keeps mimicking me
She told me not to talk to me until she apologized
This is a bit excessive
Do not know where it comes from
She was offended
I did not mean to offend
But it is impossible so that it is impossible to laugh at each other
This is a bit excessive in my opinion

Still a divorce
I got up at a quarter to eight that it was a turn
I went to bed pretty late
But even before that I fell asleep on the couch
There is a situation where I have slept enough
Do not know
Max I will take melatonin
Good
What else?
I&#39;m a little torn between these and Peter
Looks like a question does not want to give up on me
that make sense
She has all 4 people, and that too was taken from her
So you can understand
But I&#39;m pissed because I want to be a part of this project that seems really important to me
what can we do
Peter has already handed over the responsibility to Melis
But it&#39;s up to me in my opinion
There&#39;s enough work for both of us
We&#39;ll see what these say

what else?
Not too much
Another day in isolation
Saturday today
Damn a bit that tomorrow I&#39;ll probably have to work
Because I prefer to work first
I must take time off
I&#39;ll take
After soaking is over I think I&#39;ll take some time off
What a week like that
I have to take a week every quarter in my opinion
To maintain sanity
Another 16 quarters with the help of the name I am a free person
With God&#39;s help
Where do we take the vacation?
Maybe Mexico?
Maybe
It&#39;s just a financial expense
And only now have we had a big expense
And Sheeran is not working
Even a TV I can not buy
Why is TV so important to me?
I do not like the cables there
And the fact that it stands out
And that she is small
And you need an iPad to see something in it
And every time you have to bring the iPad and return it
But I know that once we buy a TV Sheeran will not forget it for me
That we buy things we do not need
But she bought Bruce for $ 180
What about it really?
Looks good this month
But she buys things
It&#39;s not that she does not buy
Maybe thirty dollars a month
So once every six months I am allowed to buy something at 200
Or wait for Cyber Monday
In November
Good
Well what else?
Already 9, maybe I&#39;ll get up?
It&#39;s just one room, I can &#39;t get up without waking Sheeran
Good
So what&#39;s next?
What do you want to do today?
Maybe just do nothing
sounds like a plan
Good
What is it?
What about politics?
I am right and wrong in politics because it is a discussion of good and evil that is subjective
So how can one argue?
I think it&#39;s like a football team
No matter what the other side does it will not be okay
In the first wave the treatment was excellent but no one said well done
Now in the second wave everyone is complaining that Bibi is to blame
okay, well
What are you complaining about?
There is a closure
Who did nothing to prepare for the second wave
Released too quickly
But not a pity for anger?
It seems boring to people so they talk about politics
what can we do
Too bad to be angry
My health is more important than I can get from the argument
It&#39;s fun to win an argument
But I do not know if it is possible to win an argument over good and evil
Do not know if the government is doing a great job
But does not bother me enough
The main complaint about Bibi is that he is corrupt
But that is what the court needs to determine
Because he decides on the good and the bad in the country
So basically as long as it&#39;s legal it&#39;s fine
The means are kosher
There are also things that are illegal and are fine
And the law needs to be changed
So the way is to function
Choose someone who thinks like you and hope he will fight for you
You can demonstrate but do not know how much it helps
What would I like to achieve from politics?
What would I change?
Weed?
Peace with the Palestinians?


I do not know what to do
Sheeran shouted at me
So I stopped talking to her until she apologized
But I do not know if she understands that she should apologize
Even though she said I&#39;m not a robot
So it seems to me that she understands
She came and asked if I was not talking to her and I did not answer
I do not know if to tell her simply that if she wants to talk to me she will apologize
Or telling her that it really bothers me that she&#39;s yelling at me and I&#39;m not ready for that
Or just keep not talking
If I tell her, I&#39;m actually talking to her and supposedly giving up
If I continue I hurt her and me too

I was already in this situation that I said sorry to apologize and she apologized and then it happened again
So basically it&#39;s a matter of competition?

How to write code on a cell phone

an Israeli withdrawal to the Green Line with equal territorial exchange, 
a family unification in Israel of 100,000 Palestinian refugees, 
West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine,

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
All right
It was hard today
I was just watching Lisa
Like some creep
See how she is with her band of roosters
Tickle it would seem she was enjoying herself
But not excessively
She also looked at Skype today
For the first time since Paul England arrived
But that means nothing
I still seem to be on a disengagement path
I think I&#39;m missing her
But also economically
It did not seem like she worked much today
It also really hurt me when I realized I was not the favorite
I do not want it to happen again
I guess she&#39;s write to me sometime or something
I think I&#39;ll just explain to her that now that she&#39;s a new favorite I also need to find a new favorite
She might say I&#39;m always the favorite
I&#39;ll tell her it&#39;s okay to have a new favorite
And that I&#39;m still there for her
And it&#39;s not goodbye, and we&#39;re having fun doing C2C again
I just can not correspond with her all day as number 2
Good
Bummer
She had already said she would not come
Maybe I should have understood then
I was deceived
In any case, nothing came of it
It actually sets me free
It&#39;s not healthy for me to sit all day and talk to her
If she really wanted to talk to me she would sign me up on Skype
But you can understand her, she does not want to put it outside of working hours
legitimate
I&#39;m just building a whole story for myself here about how much she wants me to come back
Even if it&#39;s a lot for the money
There&#39;s a big situation that I&#39;m just living in a movie
Shortened flow
What will be will be
this is life
Was this really cute from yesterday
Let&#39;s watch the segment
As if there must be a game in it
I do not know, there is a situation where they think I&#39;m handsome
I think I&#39;m pretty handsome so it&#39;s not unreasonable
Good
But yes, the test is if she talks to you outside of work hours
If not, then it probably is not really
Good
What else?
At work fine
I hope to finish soon with what they dropped on me
we will see what will be
what else?
Do not know the truth
Going to work tomorrow
I&#39;m not shaving this week as a sign of mourning
It helps with Lisa, because I less want you to see me like that
what else?
Do not know
Okay
Find us a therapist today
I need to call him tomorrow
Regarding the financial agreement I need to get back to it with the details
Good
What more?
Maybe I should do it now?
Maybe

With Hebrew support
And that it will be possible to turn it into tasks

At the moment it seems that even if I had bought all the shares from 2003, I would have earned an average of 8 percent in the quarter.
This is crazy, and does not make sense.

And what does that mean standard deviation
That means it could be that next quarter, instead of going up eight, it could go down eight.

The p / e does not really improve, it is no better than the forecast, and no better than just betting on everything.

Theory:

When there is a controlling empire, its growth rate (population) stabilizes and decreases, which causes weakening in the long run.
When there is room with wars still (not under imperial rule) the growth rate increases (like the baby boom). This is what creates a historic loop.
It can perhaps be seen in Greece and Rome, Rome ruled for about 1000 years, during which time its growth rate could decrease, and then a situation could arise where the Vikings, and the Huns multiplied and became stronger in the meantime,
Perhaps this is what is happening today, when in the Western world the growth rate is moderating and among Muslims there is still a high rate.
It is possible that today the amount of the population is already less significant, thanks to the power of technology. The more technological wins, not the most in quantity. Although technological progress depends indirectly on the number of people.

When there are more children there is less energy directed at each of them, this creates a situation of a less quality population.

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
I was at work today
It was nice
Rico was too
A good guy
Don&#39;t know if I got what I wanted
It seems like a no-brainer to me
Because of the review
what can we do
I want to do research
We do not have so much research
Maybe I can continue with Ernie
Do not know
I would have preferred to work with lime
I do not think it will be a happy question for me to leave
okay, well
what can we do
we will see what will be
What do I do with job offers?
I would check out Google&#39;s option
Good
And the rest?
Ummm…
Maybe Amazon
Maybe Facebook
The truth is I appreciate Facebook
Good
What else?
Maybe Neurlink
Maybe
What more?
I&#39;m still upset about Ashley
But I do not have much to do
Bummer
What more?
On the one hand I want to fuck more women
On the other hand, I do not want a condom
Good
What more?
We want to travel when
But it&#39;s a mess
Good
What more?
A financial agreement needs to be made
Maybe we&#39;ll try through the country
Good
What more?
I did not work on the project today
Hope I have time tomorrow
Okay
What more?
This
Okay
This week cycle
Next week will probably ovulate sometime
A week after a day off
One week after menstruation
Good
Should also finish with the house
Blush some mess
Money should also be transferred to the joint account

What do I have in mind?
politics
Who is Ann voting for?
Unknowingly, everyone is slaughtered
I need to do some brief research on the cost of housing prices
That&#39;s Saul&#39;s thing most disturbing, fucking 3,000 per apartment is madness
Besides this part of going through steps to give myself motivation, I need to divide things up for goals and give percentages
Then I really feel like I&#39;m undergoing Achievements
And give a realistic time frame
Although I do not know if times are the most important thing
I have to look in which direction I am going
I have too many options and I do not know what to choose
I do not even know what is important to me
At some level I have to make money, a certain amount to survive
I also want to study, but I do not know if it is worth within a framework
I also do not want to suffer I want I can lift my head to think
Interesting to know code writing especially on the subject of web development
I&#39;m interested in the mind
I do not know if it has any purpose, maybe it&#39;s far from that thing
I do not know
Basically I have to earn something like 5,000 to own myself
And another 5,000 for each offspring
Although even 5,000 for me I do not know if it is so realistic
How do I earn 5,000 in something I love
I need to see if I can get it as a freelancer
The problem is that as a freelancer I do not put anything into retirement

What interests me
What do I think about most of the time?
What are the concepts that appear most in my writing?
Truth is a whore&#39;s way of knowing what interests me most
The truth that interests me is how the brain works
I think in the future we will not need people, the ideas will live on another platform
I&#39;m interested in politics
I&#39;m interested in economics
I like to write code
I like to philosophize
I like to ask questions


I want a job where I can also work on whatever I want
I want a job where I will earn at least 12 net at some point (I need 5, for two kids I need another 5, and for another one sometime 2.5)
I want something that will interest me

Well I need to think about options:
Brain research
Political Science
economy
Web development
Data Security
business management

I need to rate the options in the ways I care:
Interest
Match
Of money
Free time

I have to give importance to every exam:
Most important interest - 10
Then free time - 8
Then money - 7
And adjustment - 6

I should rate each option with the above ratings:

I want a part-time job so that I can also develop personally into what interests me
Therefore the two main options are either research (and scholarship) or web development
If I go to brain research or web development, I lose the direction of economics and social sciences / country, and vice versa
So maybe it&#39;s really better to find some part time job in web development


So what
I would like a place to write the thoughts that will also allow me to run code
I would like something like Gitlab
Or Beatback, with a mission jire, Wiki
But nothing is as convenient as Google I guess
I feel nothing…
Well, come on, what&#39;s up?
what do you want?
is nothing
Need nothing
What is the thing you most enjoy doing now?
Sex with a bar
and besides that
Sex with someone who is not Sheeran
Why?
Do not know
What do I want to build?
So gdp is largely salaries + profit from interest, rent, corporate profits

So I have to study for interviews
In an interview I did it turned out that I was less good at data science and math
I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m in math
But was there too much…
I need to do an academic Cannes of Statistics
But it&#39;s about 20 hours
And I have maybe 3 hours a day
I can do it in two weeks then…
Come on
Just need to finish with the apartment

I have no power for this life

I want a way that when I have questions I can write them down to think about later
So the easiest way is to add it to reminders
But then it is difficult to add text
Another option is to start a document whose title is the title
But then it is not very accessible
And another option is to open an issue in Gitlab which is his theme
It is also not very accessible, especially when there is no internet


As long as the
What to do?
Working
project
sex
Of money

Do not know whether to sell the house
It&#39;s a lot of headache
I guess it calmed down over time
But really do not know
In the capital market I can make an average of 8%
But safely pull 6%
From real estate I think I do 12%
Which means I can probably pull 10%
Do not close on it
But this is a significant difference
Almost twice as much
That&#39;s to make 100,000 out of a million instead of 60,000
Good
What more?
How&#39;s work
Okay I think
But I feel like my manager has a problem with me a bit right now
Do not know
I think I&#39;m not fit for the job
They mostly need someone to do a platform, which means c ++, and I&#39;m really not versed
So it sucks a bit
It also does not interest me
Good
so what are we doing?
If it continues like this, I&#39;ll ask to move on
I can suggest doing a joint project with Sid&#39;s group for example
I can try to move to Ernie
I can try to move on to Peter
we will see what will be
Good
What else?
There&#39;s nothing new with Ashley
What to do…
I&#39;m going on
I was dying to tell her I was coming to Russia, if she wanted to meet
Oops
Now he has so little option
I would be happy if there was an option to send a private message
what can we do
What do I do with Sheeran?
What can I do?
I&#39;m making a financial agreement
Do not know if I will implement it
I do not want to hurt her
But also do not want to hurt myself
Maybe I really need a psychologist
I can free from work
we will see what will be
Good
What more?
Do not know
I also need someone to help me with money maybe
Good
What more?
Do not know
What more?

I would like to write here, and build something in it
Let it be possible to run it and enslave
I can write in Eclipse
But the Hebrew name is less good
Nor is there any formatting of the text
What do I care?
Perhaps the best in the terminal

Oops there is nothing
There is no interest
Boring
I&#39;m supposed to hug the boredom
But I do not want to do what I am supposed to
I want to do what I want
And that I would not be bored

Hey whats up
Everything is fine
Not too much
Saturday today
And the air outside is shit
So stay home
There is not too much to do
So get bored
If I could do anything
What would I do now?
Sex with Bar Refaeli
Or sex with Ashley
It seems to me that between the two I would have preferred with Ashley
Just because we have some kind of connection
So what in the end is it all sex?
Sex propels the world forward?
If you look at money, then the food industry is bigger isn&#39;t it?
Because by and large paying for sex is pretty taboo
Sex is supposed to be free
Although it&#39;s not really free
He needs some 3 dates
It&#39;s for the man
For this woman many times it ends in heartache
(Also for the man, but usually before sex)
So you can&#39;t put a price on it
Although it has a price
Basically it is measured in roses, a rose is $ 100, so a few hundred dollars
sort
Each date is about $ 100
Well depends on where
This is the first species
The cost of sex decreases over time
In an institutional relationship it is quite free
But at a wedding you are actually enslaving half of the income difference
When this difference can be quite large
But here too it is unreported money
But it&#39;s a lot of money
Does it contribute to the economy in any way?
How does the transfer of money contribute to the economy?
Because it is calculated in the product
Does the transfer of money from husband to wife indicate any product?
Do not think
As if a rational person would probably make this move only if it pays off for him, I would only answer if what he gets from the relationship is worth half the salary difference
Tachles is worth it only if there are children
Although the payment for children is different
This is a smaller percentage of the salary
The woman should receive 50% of the difference
Children it depends on the division of time, but in equal distribution still the percentage is lower
Children is a very long-term financial investment
And by and large today the children are no longer trusted for this support
There is a pension
So children is not an economic decision
And it seems that a woman does not either
Rationally people should just rent sex
That&#39;s illegal
I wonder if it was legal would it change that
There are countries where it is legal and people are still getting married
We may be wired to monogamy
So we find someone and only want him
It could be that women are monogamous and men are just trying not to hurt them

I wish I could write code, which would give me a place to write documents and code, and run code
I can do such a thing
Using JavaScript, I can create a website that allows writing and saving documents
The site can sit in the cloud
I can allow this site to write sites as well, because in the end it&#39;s just adding JavaScript documents
But I need to understand how to create an application in Node JS
I can thus easily add more code to the app from within the app
I can add an address that for example uses Google Image to find a person by image or link (for example to Facebook) and then let&#39;s apply it in the direction of porn
But it&#39;s hard to learn this JS
I want to make a game out of it, that instead of doing anything I do when I play, I&#39;m going to do this thing in my game
Instead of writing I will do it in a game
What are the principles of play?
A sense of progress
Small steps (each step a few short minutes)
Suppose Candy Crush
There were full stages that each played five minutes
And within an average of the five turns that can be played, go through a step or two
Sachak had to play
5*700/2 = 1750
Games that is 8750 minutes or 146 hours
The task should be simple to perform it in five minutes, for example try to bounce a bird so that it does not touch the thorns



I want to do a service that allows ordering in restaurants through the web

Steps:
Put a QR code in restaurants on a stand that is on every table - the code refers to the site that directs them to the menu (from yelp for example)
Enable menu search
Allow ordering through the menu
Allow payment through the menu

what is needed:
Order stands
Order QR codes that target my server
Make the server redirect correctly
Go to restaurants and get them to place my stands
Send an email
Go physically
Contact
to advertise

If I want to look professional, I need:
site
Logo
(video)

$ 1 million a year:
Sell the service for ten dollars a month, to 80,000 restaurants
Cities have let’s say fifty percent of the Western world, and ten percent of India and China
It&#39;s an order of magnitude of a billion
For every maximum of 100 people there is a restaurant
There are an order of magnitude of millions of restaurants in the world
It has a potential of hundreds of millions of dollars

Suppose I double my sales every year
I need 80000 in five years
In year four 40,000
In year three 20,000
In the second year 10000
In the first year 5000

How do I get to 5000 a year
That&#39;s 400 a month
It&#39;s 100 a week

I&#39;m just adding stuff to the bookmark list…
I need to concentrate
in what?
In language processing
In computational learning
I would be happy if I could do it from my cell phone
But this is not critical
What is critical?
Do not know…
Do I even want to engage in learning?
Why?
I want to reach 20% so I can retire next year

Investments
Why not invest 90% on the market, and 10% against it
Let’s say the market goes up each year by x%, and once every 10 year it goes down 50%
While the average is 10%
(1+x)^9*0.5=1.1^10
(1+x/1.1)^9=2.2
x =2.2^(1/9)*1.1-1=~0.2
In this case the portfolio earns 0.9*1.2+0.1*0.8=1.16 in the good years, and 0.9*0.5+0.1*2=0.65 in the bad year, instead of 1.2 in the good and 0.5 in the bad
I can even make it more stable by investing more against the market. Say I want steady 8%, that means x*1.2+(1-x)*0.8=0.8+0.4*x=1.08 x=0.7
Then in the bad year I get 0.7*0.5+0.3*2=0.95, which is not super bad
Generally, if the average is 10% then 
x ^ 9 * y = 1.1 ^ 10
9*ln (1+x)+ln (1-y) = 10*ln (1.1)
9x-y = 0.95

You need to make a website where you can order surveys
And it really produces the most popular polls
To order a survey you need to answer a survey
To see a survey one has to answer a survey
Instead of liking, answer a survey
But it must be with a representative distribution of the civilian population

the main idea:
Use naive labeling to get full labeling
for example:
The dog entered the other room and began to bark.
Objective:
The object is activated to the object of description and is active to act
The idea is that you can use the closed group tags (connecting link words, etc.) to tag the open group (verb verbs adjectives…)
In the example above the intention is to get from:
ה * * ל * ה * ו * *
Aim for the top
In the first stage, it is possible to notice that after the names and adjectives appear, before the verbs appear
More features:
Dictionary - find words that are not ambiguous in terms of part of speech
morphology:
A verb looks like this: verb, verb, marvel…
Noun: Kill, Kill, Katalon ...

what&#39;s going on?
All is well
Yesterday we landed
I woke up at a quarter to five because of the divorce
I need to ask Shiran for the melatonin
It will probably take two weeks for him to pass
As always
Maybe melatonin will help
seen
They said maybe fasting, maybe
What else?
Today I have to finish the blah blah course
Spark course
And also go over lectures from ACL
This
Then a weekend
What do we do on the weekend?
Do not know
Not too much probably
Too bad we did not bring the hdmi cable and it is still on my list
I just did not look
okay, well
Maybe you can order online
Because then you can see things on TV instead of on the iPad
Apart from TV, what is being done?
There is a sea view
But what does it give?
It&#39;s nice to sit sometimes
But a chair is missing here
The place is beyond what I expected
Really nice hotel room
Huge bed
Small balcony with sea view
Great TV
Bath and shower with cool stream and hot water
Not such suffering
We can see things on the iPad
Do yoga, dance
We&#39;ll get along
Maybe we&#39;ll play games
I will also work on the project maybe
I do not have the laptop, but we&#39;ll manage
Maybe I can work with the iPad
interesting
how?
I need to edit the code in GitHub
The question is whether it is possible to update the app
Maybe in the UI
You can try
If so, it could actually make me give up a computer and switch to an iPad
See if and where we get stuck
What else?
Now it will be harder for me to do c2c we are both in the room 24/7
I can take the iPad to the bathroom from time to time
I can not record but it&#39;s small
You can make baths and such
Good
What else?
In two weeks my sister is getting married
Her future husband and basically my whole family is pretty extreme leftist
For them, Bibi is the enemy
But in the end this is about values
There is no right and wrong
You can agree on what is more important and what is less important and then look at data, but the problem is look at what is more important and what is less important
Equality is more important to them and freedom is more important to me
Freedom - national freedom
Freedom - Private freedom
Another distinction
Freedom - The Restrictions of Freedom Concerning Global Freedom, the freedom of one individual will not infringe on the freedom of another individual
Freedom - Private freedom

Why freedom always goes with religion

Assume negative that all not exist is a paradox, therefore we must exist

where
This is a new question
To what place
In English it&#39;s like where
What is the destination

how
What&#39;s the way
Why
What is the reason

How to explain through in simpler words
Is it possible to find the most basic words?
These are probably the most common words

What do I want to do
If I pass it is good and bad
On the one hand interesting on the other hand Flavi who is smart in my opinion, failed
So a little stressful
As if all your life you are at the same level of stress and happiness
To the point of noise
Is pressure the opposite happy?
Maybe not the other way around but it definitely detracts from the happiness
Is it happiness to want what you have?
I think happiness is just being in a static state, eternal peace, maybe death is happiness
But suppose a state of euphoria or joy is not confirmed because your brother you are down
If today is better than yesterday you should be happy
If every day is better than before you should be happy all the time
What does it mean better?
If you can predict it then you will enjoy it less

Hi what&#39;s going on?
Sabba
How was your day?
Sabba
I talked to the lawyer
He wants NIS 5,000
I&#39;ll talk to the last lawyer to get a quote and then we&#39;ll see
Good
I talked to the girl from Google
we will see what will be
Need to prepare
What else?
Please
How&#39;s work
Not easy
I have the project that ended this week
This thing of text normalization, that I have not yet finished what I had to do
And the lemmatization, which I also did not finish,
And I didn&#39;t really progress in transliteration either…
I&#39;m very slow
That the corona will end
I think it hurts me at work
I talked to the psychologist
I need to test this CBT
I can do this course בזה
interesting
It&#39;s good to see how the treatment goes
That is, what else?
It seems that the matter with the apartment has turned around
Maybe I&#39;ll wait another day, to see that the payment has passed
What more?
Bassa that I&#39;m now spending $ 5000 on this shit
Good
What more?
Do not know
What else is there?
lets see
To whom to donate?
Find an accountant
Study for an interview
The most important thing is to study for an interview right now
What about donating?
The desire to maximize human life - I do not know if happiness can be controlled
So contribute to what will increase human life with a minimum of money
Is there a difference between human lives? I do not think, is human life measured in money?
Maybe increasing human years, saving an old man is different from saving a child I guess
Good
How much to give?
Ten percent
But what about income tax, it&#39;s also give, it&#39;s over 30 percent and about a third of that goes to welfare
So come on I already give 10%
…
Ten percent of what I spend
Suppose one spends 6000, should donate 600
How much am I donating now?
35 each salary
To an organization that deals with heart problems, to Wikipedia and to Cannes Academic
1750 or almost 150 a month
I can double that
Donate another 25 against malaria, that&#39;s another 1250 a year,
3000 saves a human life, so every two and a half years I save a child, it&#39;s some 70 years of man, it&#39;s full



Hey whats up?
Sabba
What about you?
All is well
This weekend we are going to this festival
Friday the last day with Ashley…
On Thursday I&#39;m going to the office
A week full of activity
This is also a week of ovulation
I&#39;ll probably have sex
But what about being in the office?
I&#39;ll probably go to some stripper
And what if Ashley is?
magnificent
I would love for you to be
Maybe I&#39;ll show her the office a little
And where will I masturbate?
Probably in the bathroom
Although there is no WiFi there, there is but less,
And the lighting is shit
Where is the roundabout lighting?
Maybe in the wardrobes downstairs?
The lighting will be better in the gym but it is impossible to lock it there
What nonsense
What&#39;s their point?
I can rent a room
Isn&#39;t that an exaggeration?
Do not know
It also needs to be planned
Maybe at that Motel 6
You can stay there for $ 76 a room
segment
Okay
I got the sitting with these a bit stuck…
Well I just need to get organized on this in the morning
Good
What else?
What do I do with Ashley?
Do not know…
I was really happy for you to let me meet her
Save me from this situation
What situation?
That I&#39;m not with the most equal girl possible
Is it as worthwhile as possible?
She&#39;s really worth it
I&#39;ve seen full of women, and no one does it to me like her
What about women in the real world?
who will?
Gal Gadot?
She has no tit
Most beautiful women do not have a tit
So she&#39;s most beautiful with a tit?
What about Kate Upton? Plump
What about that one from Gustine Tiberlake&#39;s song?
Equal - Scarlett Johansson
But what until I get it always happens to me?
Tachles I would have preferred without marriage
I have no problem giving them children
But without marriage
And is it not a problem that a child grows up without a father?
Dedi Issues
Do not know
Ido has Dedi Ishuiz, but he&#39;s a nice man
who else?
Il Biran
People fire
who else?
Lior?
Can&#39;t remember anymore
Because I just do not want a marriage
I want to enjoy
What are we here for if not to enjoy
The missing hand
Everyone does what is good for them
And what&#39;s wrong with me like now just going to someone else every month?
Not bad for me
Good
so what are we doing?
Do not know…
I have no idea
And does it not bother me that I encourage a prostitution industry?
No
I support regulated prostitution
And what about women pimps?
It is not
I do not support
But I come to her, and she&#39;s independent, so no problem
But I do not know how to know
That place was with a lot of women so it looked like a pimp
But they may have a place where they banded together
And there may be a place where someone is different every day
Shorter is hard to know
But what can I do
I&#39;d rather pay for it than start a relationship
Good
What else?
Do not know
There is not too much
What about the festival?
I&#39;m a little pissed I&#39;m not contributing my share
I donate my money
But do not know
I had to just agree
okay, well
What will be will be
It will be a drug addict
I do not have much
I have letters,
There are mushrooms
There is cannabis
Good
What about work?
Do not know
I made some progress in everything I had
we will see what will be
He was interesting in politics
I did not think that a political system with two parties competes for the center, and a political system with many parties competes for the center of the coalition, which is basically one side
Although not necessarily
Why not have a center coalition
Because there is only one prime minister
But that&#39;s pretty stupid
The bigger party will take the head
that make sense
But at least the ministers will be on both sides
Why is it not like that?

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Today was supposed to be a day off
But because of Elior I can not take him
Sabba
tomorrow
What else?
I have to learn chess to give Fayette to Yaron
Good
What more?
I read the book that Jonathan recommended
The truth is he&#39;s nice
He argues that because the function was intended to develop he should have had self-defense
And because of self-defense he will do whatever is necessary including hurting people
Yes
It makes perfect sense
What is the solution?
Chip to the brain
If we become as smart as he is, there will be no problem
Good
What else?
poker
Okay
Do I have time for all these things?
I also need to end with the financial agreement
There are also all sorts of job interviews that may need to be prepared
lots of things
What to do?
It&#39;s a matter of habits
What did we have?
guitar
capacity
chess
poker
language?
Job Interview
dances
Book
If I dedicate to everyone (not including language) half an hour 3 times a week, it comes out 7 * 3 * .5 which is about ten and a half hours, or an hour and a half a day if you include the Sabbath
If I take off for twenty minutes it&#39;s an hour a day
If I take off twice a week it&#39;s 40 minutes a day
It&#39;s not so bad
I can do it and I will have time left for projects and such
Maybe I should decide between poker and chess
I can connect pairs of things. I can arrange from the hardest to the easiest:
Fitness / dancing
Chess / Poker
Language / Guitar
Book / Interview
Right now I&#39;m just doing dance and guitar (and singing) fitness and book
I need to replace the retarded game with poker, after I read the instructions
Chess can replace the game in the bathroom
The question is which is better
Do not know
Interview I do a question once a week
I can increase to two or three questions
What about a probability question?
Maybe really one like this and one like this (which will take 40 minutes instead of 20)
But where do I put it?
Fitness I do before a meal and a dance before a meal
I can do the same with a guitar, and a question before a guitar before a meal
Good
When do the games come in?
Poker is a matter of seconds
Chess minutes
I can switch to chess instead of a second game at the pick



So Deep Money
What are the steps
what are the options
I would like to be able to predict a function
Kegel
Try adding data with adding noise

to predict
So I had some nice ideas but it’s not getting feedback in reddit…

Equality prevents progress, imagine birds were not allowed to have wings because it’s an unfair advantage…

What’s fairness?

impartial and just treatment or behavior without favoritism or discrimination

Impartial - treating all rivals or disputants equally; fair and just.

Just - based on or behaving according to what is morally right and fair

Treatment - the manner in which someone behaves toward or deals with someone or something

Behavior - the way in which one acts or conducts oneself, especially toward others

Favoritism - the practice of giving unfair preferential treatment to one person or group at the expense of another.

Discrimination - 
the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex
recognition and understanding of the difference between one thing and another

Compound definition:
Equal behavior towards different categories

Is equality a positive thing?

Does society benefit from equality?
If you favor one on the benefit of the many, I guess not…
But for example, communism wasn’t good for the society, even though it’s based on equality…

What are we trying to maximize here?
The average happiness? (how are you from 1 to 10)

But there is a correlation between happiness and equality

Is happiness the most important thing?

What’s more important than happiness?
For example I won’t give up iq for happiness…
So is iq the most important?
Why? What does that give me?
Why is discovering patterns so important?
It helps predict the future, I might be happy now, but if I don’t predict the future I might not keep being happy…
I wouldn’t give up creativity for happiness
What is creativity?
The ability to come up with new ideas
So anyone who just come up with tons of stupid ideas is creative?
No, the ideas shouldn’t be stupid. 
What about a painter, he doesn’t really come with ideas.
So maybe it’s not just the creation of ideas, but any creation that is positive.
But positive is in the eye of the beholder…
So if there’s no crowd, is he still creative?
Well to measure his creativity, there has to be a beholder…
Can I measure my own creativity? I guess I can, but it’s probably more accurate the more people look at it…

So why is the ability to create more important to me than happiness?
Maybe because I enjoy it?
Maybe it’s part of my happiness, so I can’t be happy without creating?

Why isn’t happiness, the most important thing?

Maybe I want to create intelligent and important stuff, 
Why important?
I want to be important.
What’s important?
That has value.
How do you measure value?
Money?
I guess not only, a teacher creates tons of value, but is not getting paid much, well that’s probably because there are many people doing that…
A nobel prize discovery is super valuable, but moneywise it’s only worth 1M$.
Because people don’t do it for money, 
Why do they do it?
To be important?
Because it’s interesting to them? Probably…
What is interesting?
Something that increases curiosity.
What’s curiosity?
The will to understand.

What’s the conclusion?

So can value be measured by money

For example a nobel price can’t really be valued with money
Because it’s free for everyone to use, the paper is public.
So how do you measure the value of papers?

So equality is related to nobel laureates…
But is that the important measure?

So IQ is also (negatively) correlated to gini (more equality more iq)
But it could be related to the gdp per capita…

Being happy, is being satisfied, like being full, but I’d rather be hungry and eating then be full…

My favorite hunger is curiosity 


what&#39;s up bro?
Everything is fine
Not too much
I have this interview in two weeks
You also have to finish things at work
What to do
Pretty usual
Also need the LLC to do
What more…
It seems to me after the interview I will take some time off
All the time I work I feel
Need some week without hazel in the evening
Sabbath week
Why really at work we do not have one
Should do so
There are supposed to be 7 sabbaticals a year
In total there are 2 Christmases and Thanksgiving
And two more three with days off
It should be arranged that he goes out every seven weeks or so
I might be bored
I don’t know what to do
I want my hobby to be neural nets
But it doesn’t feel like a hobby
It feels like work
That’s why I wanted to gamify
But I don't know how
All I need is to write how much do I profit and how much time it takes
That’s it
But how much do I profit from a nn generated music?
Maybe I can set the final score, for example what would be the goal of this?
To have beautiful music for ever 
That’s a nice goal, it has a score that I can split to steps

What are the decisions for the coming year?
Guitar - 3 times a week 20 min - V
Bible - once a week 20 min - V
Physical training - twice a week 20 minutes - V
Get accepted to Google

Work on a project
See how much a month&#39;s work yields
If a month does not yield progress to abandon
But if there is already potential, it&#39;s a shame to throw no?
Yes, you can take advantage of the potential and move on to another project, right?
Anyway there is a lot of time in the year, it is possible to work on 3-4 projects in my opinion
Kegel
Vipassana
3-4 courses
Language Processing - V
Computational Learning - V
Arabic?
Stop addictions

What do I need to do to call this productive break?
Classify my docs
I also have to go through my emails 
Bookmarks? Tasks? Asana?
What about vacation?

Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Everything is fine
I sat with Erez today
The truth was quite interesting
I also sat with Gal
Was really nice truth
A good guy
The truth is I was on fire for his wife
But it has good taste
Also smart
Walla
What else?
Still addicted to live sex
And turn
Although I can not do too much
Ziv suggested we do something on Thursday
I am in favor
But I do not want to organize
You can just order to a pub or something
But you can also sit at sea
The question is whether it is possible to sit at sea with alcohol
It&#39;s possible
So I can order to the sea
Okay
Sabba
What else?
Walla
Do not know
Tomorrow we might as well drive to the center
Good
What else?
I do not have the strength to work on the project
Takes freedom
I also need time off work
Good
Maybe towards the end of the quarter
Hope to finish everything ahead of time and get out
Good
What else?
There is not too much
Most of the time I spend in live sex

Ok

The results from the tf experiment look promising.
What’s the next step?
I need to predict on real world data.
Try trading for a few weeks with this system, see how well it’s doing.
Let’s say we do this for a month or 2.
If everything goes well we can start trading for real.

What about syndications?
That too.
I need to analyze ±20 deals before committing to one.
Ok,
If I get 20% I’m great!



Hey
what&#39;s going on?
All is well
What about you?
Sabba
It was a good day
Some sun at noon
I pretty much got what I wanted at work
What&#39;s more than that?
I pretty much finished what I needed at home
I wanted to study for System Design interviews
It seems to me that I quite understood the passage
what else?
what do you want?
Sex with full girls
Really obsessed with the subject
Is anyone stopping you?
Some…
There is a closure
And also morality
Although happiness is the most important thing no?

I have an interview I should do in c ++
Not so much remember the language
I was thinking of doing a translation between programming languages
Download solutions to the same problems in different languages
Maybe it is also possible to somehow produce some language model
See what the most common things are
Sheeran shouted at me
For saying I did not really wait for me she waited for me to take things out of the dishwasher
It was more like a joke
but it does not matter
Even if it was serious, it&#39;s still no reason to shout
Shouting is violence to me
There is never a reason for violence
Good
What else?
That&#39;s I left the house
And now I have to do everything with the cell phone
Maybe I should go back to the room I took
Maybe
Maybe we&#39;ll start with breakfast and coffee
But where to sit?
I&#39;m not that hungry
I&#39;m pretty thirsty
And I also prefer to eat with my coffee
But because of thirst I have no appetite so I do not so much know what I feel like
I have no power
I also need to resolve the question
And go through the emails
And I do not have an endless battery

Good
Sheeran apologized
That&#39;s not enough for me
I can not live with people shouting at me
How do I know this will not happen again?
She has promised in the past that it will not happen again
But it always happens again
so what are we doing?
Disassemble it?
Need some treatment
Or maybe a break, to see what the right thing to do
Maybe
I can ask the caregiver, let&#39;s see what she says

so what are we doing???
Walla does not know Ya in Dalek
So that&#39;s a problem
Why do I want to play this game?
It&#39;s not too complicated
The animation is appealing
competitive
Can I make such a game out of my life?
Where do I want to go?
To the State of the Art Bot


How do I make it a game?
Need small and uncomplicated parts
Need some animation
Need to be competitive - I think language is not so lacking


It&#39;s not a problem to open a project in some task app
And turn it into a game
Each task is broken down into small and uncomplicated tasks
And the competition is to complete all tasks
Not here but so animated
Don&#39;t know if this is really critical
Big enough Excel page
I may be able to control the graphics with the app that turns sheets into apps

Asana turned
I would add points
For example, according to the number of hours something takes
Suppose the goal is to reach 10,000 hours
And every hour is a point
But asana does not have a field of how long it takes

I can pay $ 10 a month to have custom reports and fields
Or I can build some system
$ 10 a month is something like a $ 1,000, $ 2,000 investment
Which is something like two days to a week of work
I do not know if I can build something like this in a week, but it might also be interesting to do it
I can try the Asana Premium and decide.
I can also just write the part of the report myself, and use Asana&#39;s api

Another question is what will I work on
By and large it was cool to work on a model of dialogue
But now I&#39;m supposed to deal with transliteration
I have no problem working on it but by and large it&#39;s quite ready, just missing to make it an integration to Sequoia and then to Morpon
So it&#39;s not exactly Machin Lerning
And I have nothing to work on in my free time
So what to work on in my free time?
dialogue?
What will benefit Siri?
By and large what else in Morphen can be statistical?
Everything
for example?
What&#39;s in Morphen?
Tokenization, transliteration, inflation,

Okay so Asana Premium costs $ 50 a month and has to be paid for a year
So I will probably give up…
What are the options?

Jira?
Asana not premium?
Something of mine?
Warrick?

So what the hell to do?
I do not know!
Another week without direction?
By and large I would be happy to work on transliteration…
But even there I deal in poop
Like there are more things to do, but only after I finish the poop…
On the one hand I do not want to work on poop at home,
On the other hand I do not want to work on something else at home, and prefer to concentrate on it

so what to do?
Just flow?
But if I flow, I just go to sleep
what will I do? meditation?
I would like it to be my hobby
Let&#39;s just come home and open my models…
But that&#39;s not the point right now
I hope to reach this stage as soon as possible
Then continue in directions that interest me

In the meantime I will do a Kegel course…









Hey
what&#39;s going on?
All is well
What about you?
Sabba
So what kind of project was done?
There are several options
Current functionality of morphine - talk to corenl
Data Detectors
Active Lerning
Body Change - &quot;Tell Mom I Love Her&quot;
Okay
What else?
What about Ashley Elizabeth
Oops she does not answer
It seems to me this is it
It&#39;s over
Oops
What about a psychologist?
What about Ivska?
What about drugs?
Do not know
Where to begin?
What about the house
Semc
What an unnecessary house
so what are we doing?
I can sell it
But it&#39;s work, too
Maybe over time it becomes less work
Maybe
What more?
The project
Do not know
It&#39;s at work too
Do not know need to see if anyone can help me
I would be really happy if anyone could help there
What else?
Do I want another project?
I tried to understand how the capital market is related to the national product
There is a connection
Basically you can count a product in several ways
product
Final product - intermediate product
+ Exported product - imported
income
Private income (salary)
Profits (incorporated or not)
Income from taxes
expenditure
Private expenditure
investment
Public investment
Import balance
So overall if you look at the income of the companies, the profits, it should be related to the capital market
When companies make a lot of profits, and people make a lot, the product also grows
The question is whether this is what matters
Let&#39;s see if that makes sense
as per:
Private income was about 11.5 trillion
The profits are about 2.5 trillion
At s &amp; p 500 the p / e is 30, and the market cap is 30 trillion
Which means the profits are about a trillion
That it makes sense that they make up about half of all profits
interesting
The CRSP US Total Market Index is currently at $ 2500
His pe also around the 30s
The eps around the 80s
pe = marketCap/earnings=price/eps
EPS = earnings/shares
30 ~= 2500/80
did not help
Maybe the russel 3000
The truth is that its market cap is also around 30 trillion
mozar
Good
But quite logically, there is a situation where the other half of the money is private
There is a situation
Good
What else?
Do not know
What do you want to know?
What about the more important part, private income
There are 150 million employees here
They bring in an average of 50,000 a year
That comes out to 7.5 trillion
That pretty much gets along with a private income of 11.5 trillion
Although 4 trillion have disappeared here which is a lot of money
But it&#39;s an order of magnitude
Okay so the rest is public pay 1.5t and employer contributions 2t

Good
What do I do with all job offers?
On the one hand I want to practice
On the other hand I have no power over it
so what are we doing?
Maybe
I do not know what to do
Good
What more
Maybe I should pick a company or two and give it a try
Maybe just try Google
What to say to others?
If Google does not work, will I switch?
Do not know
where?
If the company interests me then why not
If it&#39;s not interesting then no

What about the books?
Maybe I should start reading
Maybe I should start with the second book he recommended to me
Maybe
Good
What else?
Maybe I&#39;ll just listen
Maybe
What else?
is nothing
enough



So nothing matters?
It&#39;s all a result of physics and biology and psychology and sociology
But does that mean nothing matters?

The conclusion comes from induction
We once thought that what matters is God
Or the king
Or the state
Or equality
Or freedom
And all were found to be arbitrary
moment
Are they arbitrary?

What does it mean to be important?
Meaning what value we give to talk
Can we just not give values to things?
This probably happens naturally
There are values that are quite ingrained in us
Like the importance of sex and food

There are social values
Are social values not important?
We can not ignore them completely
We can try to live on a lonely island
But as long as we do not, we must consider the values of others

Okay
So basically there are social values
Is a world without social values better?
A moment when there are no social values there is no meaning to better

Okay


So what do you think?
Not too much
What do I already have to think
I want a throne
To buy freedom
I need NIS 3 million
This means an order of magnitude of 1000-2000 shekels 1000-2000 times
This means that if a day I get 1000-2000 shekels I need 1000-2000 such, which is between 3-6 years, or if not calculated Friday and Saturday, then 5-10 years
Or I will just get 10,000 a month forever which means 300 shekels a day, or 500 shekels a day not including Saturday
how do I do it?
All in all, it will be enough for me to have an apartment that I rent, I need NIS 10,000 from the apartment, a two-room apartment in Dizengoff is worth about NIS 5,000 a month, and is worth about NIS 2 million, that means you need 2 for 10,000 a month, that means you need 4 million for it
So how do you get NIS 4 million?
10000 a month is 120 thousand a year, it&#39;s about 3 percent a year, it&#39;s not that much, only inflation 3 percent, but it&#39;s related to inflation, so basically it&#39;s 3 above inflation
There are better investments

I would like to develop an app, how much money is a user worth?
Facebook Yahoo and Likdain make about $ 1-2 per user per year, Google makes $ 10 per year
According to an estimate of a dollar per user, I need 120,000 shekels a year, which is 30,000 dollars, that means 30,000 users,
By an estimate of 10 cents I need 300 thousand

What do I want to do?
I want to play civilization
I want to build the game
What in total is in it
There is a board, which consists of squares, there are people and there are products that people can produce
Each slot has properties
Everyone has characteristics
Every product has characteristics
The properties can be listed on the fly
The properties should amount to
transportation
health
Education
culture
security
Sentence
Of money
Welfare
    
Suppose a community of chimpanzees
Any chimpanzee can:
move
eat
Fight
Produce
reproduce
Discard lice

Any organism can:
Perform metabolism (eat)
reproduce

Animals can also move





Hey
what&#39;s going on?
Everything is fine
I made some progress in the project they dropped on me
we will see what will be
I&#39;m a little impatient to hear an answer from Google
Let&#39;s hope for the best
Tomorrow goes to work
That&#39;s nice
What more?
Do not know
There is a lot of Todos to do
Let&#39;s end with the prenuptial agreement and couple therapy
Dude, let&#39;s move on
A course, or project, is done
Or both
Good
You also need to take care of the license
Tomorrow morning
What more?
Dentist
When?

Hey whats up?
everything is good how are you?
Sabba
Beauty
What are you telling?
Lisa is only coming back next week
Freedom is about to end
I do not know if it sucks me too much
I&#39;ll probably go to the office next week which&#39;s nice
I also have no problem working, like I did this week
A little bassa to get out of bed
But not too much bass work
I also do not have too much work
I need to talk to these
I&#39;m thinking of asking her about moving a team
I do not feel I have much to contribute to this team
Because most of the work is not in computational learning or research
But I do not want you to get hurt
I can ask her if she thinks it&#39;s a good idea
To move to either Ernie or Lime
There is a situation they are not looking for
There is a situation
Although it seems like there&#39;s a lot of work with Ernie
But have specialized for it זה
Good
I just don’t feel like I’m contributing much
And I do not want to mess with the platform
Good
We&#39;ll see what happens to her
I also wonder what about the work on the news
interesting
What more?
Maybe about computational learning for Chip Design
Yes
I can upload it
Okay
What else?
Tomorrow I have a day off, that&#39;s what it looks like
The bassa is that for the most part the check in is only in some 3
Probably a turn to come at 12 if there is no one there
But do not know if it is possible before that
I can call several places
I have no problem paying another $ 20-30 to earn a few hours
Okay
then what?
Comes with the iPad
Sitting in the room
And think what I want to do
we will see what will be
Okay
Maybe sex?
Maybe
Okay
What else?
Do not know
Another 4-5 years for Maniac
a lot of time
Hope for some two or three months of freedom
How I did not take advantage of the corona to be in the country
Well, I did not bring results anyway, from the country I probably would have brought less
On the other hand, maybe more important is my life outside of work no?
תכלס
Good
Maybe I should go now?
Maybe
Good
What more?
Do you want to travel?
A little want
Yes
So what&#39;s the plan?
Do not know
Good

My book will be read
Documents and thoughts
Thoughts and documents
Well then there is
What about a book?
About what he will be
A collection of my thoughts
Why would anyone care about my thoughts?
What do I care if someone cares?
I want to leave something
Or rather my thoughts want to stay

I want to analyze a language
How to analyze a language?
what&#39;s the point
I have the syntactic tree of the sentence
Did I understand the sentence?
Understand the sentence if you have the representation of the world it represents in your head

They show that: king-man = queen-woman
I wonder if a definition also works that way, for example
Dictionary = collection + words + annotations
It makes a bit of sense because it adds to all the sentences in which the word appeared in the collection the sentences in which the word words appeared and the collection of sentences with annotations

Peace
I feel stuck
I&#39;m not progressing in anything for the full time

Maybe if I use its issue track for my life
Why is it not as user friendly as this app?
You can use Git Love
But I do not know how neat it is

I would like to arrange what I write by topics
To be more orderly
I would like a tree of knowledge from what I write,
How does it help?
Do not know, but otherwise why write
Write because it&#39;s easier to talk to myself like that
When it passes in the real world

What a terrible headache I had yesterday
Jesse a heat stroke to the face
I do not know how it is valid so strongly
And why so long after I was in the sun

The problem with web applications is that it is not possible to work offline
Technically I can broadcast from my cell phone, but it would be good if there was an option for offline use

I want a million dollars
Even three quarters is enough for me
I need a profit of a dollar on a million products
Or a profit of a thousand dollars on a thousand products
I want to do a simulation of reality
From statistics to build a model of reality
I want to play with it, like civilization
I want to build software that is like Fractal
Each object is the object from which it inherits with the same change
Human society is a fractal
Every public is in the image of a person
Every public has needs, feelings, ideas
I want to make software that simulates the genetic tree
Each creature inherits from the previous one with a mutation
We&#39;re just talking monkeys
It allows us to work together
This is why a group of 5 is stronger than just about any animal
That&#39;s why we&#39;re at the top of the food chain
Even a monkey can use a stick to hunt
But alone he will have a hard time
Actually I do not know
Yes because one stick is not enough to kill an animal
And he can only run with one stick
But five people
Maybe one that carries and four more shots
It&#39;s much harder to stop
Monkeys are talking
It&#39;s crazy
 
So if we remove god from the equation, religion is just an ideology, a law system.
The problem is adding god to that equation.
Why do we need god there?
What if we just say, oh that’s a nice set of rules and that’s it?
Like the Hamorabi laws.
That’s not a problem, though for some reason I can’t think of any that made its way all the way to today.
You can argue that Buddhism does not contain a god, but just an enlightened person.
Democracy is a pretty old set of rules that survived nicely as well, but isn’t as comprehensive as religion.
Is there anything comparable today?
Maybe communism/capitalism.
Actually capitalism is a bit more permissive it seems.

I guess just a book of laws wouldn’t be as viral as a religious book.
A religious book contains a story.
And also a reason for the laws, and not just because I said so.
If it was just because I said so kind of thing it would only last till that person dies.
So you need an immortal entity there.


So all I’m saying, the idea behind religion is nice, they just want to say “be nice”.
Leave god aside, isn’t it a good idea?
So basically people are fighting over the way you should be nice to each other.
All the religions say that.
Communism also kinda says that.
Nationalism also kinda says that, I guess.
Capitalism is different, it doesn’t say how you should be nice though, it actually kinda says you don’t have to be nice, even by taking care of your needs, you’ll improve society.

How does that work with being in the moment?
Maybe there’s room for both.
This is kind of a nihilistic approach.
So nihilism could sit together with any ideology?

But then doesn’t god say to be nice to each other?
Well then be in the moment god doesn’t really say that, I think…

So, maybe all the ideologies are actually a mix of ideologies, mix of stories.

Maybe abraham, was somewhere where the god story was successful, and tried it somewhere else.

Why worship?
Because worship makes you stronger and happier.
So is it about happiness, or about energy?
Maybe happiness is energy?

I wonder if a computer can distinguish between actual stories and made up stories, that’s basically say if someone’s lying…
I wonder if you can do that just by content.
Could it distinguish between I’m sitting on my chair to I’m standing in the kitchen?

Maybe constantine saw how well the jews are staying together that he decided to invent christianity to do the same thing for rome

So should one always flow?
Always be in the moment?
Is planning a bad thing?
Can you be in the flow and plan?
You should flow if you want to be happy,
But do you always want to be happy?
Sometimes you want to be creative maybe…
But if nothing is important, why do that?
Why not be happy all the time
If that’s what you want to do.
But do you?
If you should do what you want to do, and you want to be creative and not happy, you should be creative.
But then you’re not happy, 
So what should you do? What makes you happy, or what it is that you want to do?
Well, if you want to maximize the integral, sometimes you shouldn’t do what you want to do.
But then we always do what we want to do, we had to want to do it in order to do it.
This is pretty complicated now it feels.

There are 2 options:
Do what makes you happy (in the long run)
Do what you want to do.
But we always do what we want to do, so does that mean that we never do what makes us happy? No it just means we did both at the same time.
So it’s not always contradicting. But maybe sometimes.
And then we should choose to do what you want to do right?
That’s the only possible choice, because if I did it, I wanted to do it.
So all we need is to try to make everything we want to do the thing that makes us happy.

Mati says it’s all excuses, and that the first man didn’t think that.
Maybe he didn’t think about energy, maybe he did?

Society is a fractal, because everything is a fractal.
Except man made things, is society man made?
Good question.
To some degree for sure, and probably that means it’s a fractal to some degree.

You should always want to do what makes you happy in the long term

So does paying taxes go there? Yes, i guess.
What about smoking, I’d want to smoke even though it’s shortening my life span and my happiness. So I shouldn’t smoke, but then I smoke, and that’s what I wanted so that’s what I should have.
Should I always do what I want to?
There’s no other option.
But I should want to do what makes me happy in the long term.

Why don’t people teach capitalism from kinder garten?
Because this is a government expense, and the government cares about it self…
So if we have anarcho capitalism, how would people behave?
Should we trust the “missing hand” (that’s god in the capitalist mythology)
But sometimes there are market failures, the markets can’t resolve.
But most times, the government makes it worse rather then better…
Well maybe not, but maybe more times than with government.
Maybe,
Can we simulate that?
I’d love to…
But how?
Machine learning…
But we don’t have enough data.
What are the variables?
Market failures, freedom or government intervention.
Can we check if the government intervention helped.
I can probably list some market failures
Then check government intervention.
Then check if we need more or less.
No need for machine learning
But you do need to read about market failures
Check their distribution in reality,
And sample a couple for each type.
