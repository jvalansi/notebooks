64.47	Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
99.75	Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[dec]
110.82	Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
122.35	Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh I dunno .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
132.31	Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , and I'll have a look if Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
149.44	Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
159.54	And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
175.7	Um now I'll look at show this board .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
204.76	we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
210.91	We should make it uh compatible with our new D.V.D. and other releases we have , our technical releases .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
224.75	And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D.V.D. and a television .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
275.12	Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
320.28	Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
332.75	Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
399.22	Well s then start .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
586.07	So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
595.74	No you can click it on your television .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
612.92	Well we'll have a look at it , yeah .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
689.59	Well we'll have a look .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
845.69	Well go ahead .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
901.82	Click .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	Click	[]	[]	[]
1115.52	No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1122.21	reject R. R.S.I. R.S.I. .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	reject	[]	[]	[R., R.S.I., R.S.I.]
1219.01	Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[Mike]
1233.18	Well then we have still the time , so But we do have to come to a decision , right later on .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1370.45	make someone w 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1479.92	Well what if we um I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , a f a little uh You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1547.88	Well maybe w we could uh s On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L.C.D. th that you can click on or something , or that you can click uh out uh of the remote .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[lo, L.C.D.]
1657.35	Um we can use this board again , I think .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1660.58	Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1859.82	Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2095.28	But you will have to make consensus with .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2222.71	We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2230.55	You can make it wider and less wide .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2292.83	Go to video , that's always on your remote control .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
2327.43	No you can ch push zero .	TS3009b.A.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
17.62	get this .	ES2016d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
34.35	Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting .	ES2016d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
38.77	Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation .	ES2016d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
46.13	Um then we will um do an evaluation .	ES2016d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
57.48	Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .	ES2016d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
62.05	Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line .	ES2016d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
341.83	Um do you have a marketing presentation for us .	ES2016d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
724.89	Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece .	ES2016d.A.words.xml	Pray	[]	[]	[]
985.78	Wonder if I can make this 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	Wonder	[]	[]	[]
1282.72	Besides look at what the L.C.D. does to our lovely remote .	ES2016d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1348.11	Let's see here .	ES2016d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1419.97	think we tried a lotta different things and um 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1482.84	Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary .	ES2016d.A.words.xml	complete	[]	[]	[]
1509.99	And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that .	ES2016d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
28.45	So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
57.34	And we'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
63.16	Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Euro]
158.66	Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
258.58	To navigate it through th through teletext .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	navigate	[]	[]	[]
750.34	No , wait .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
815.21	Uh for a remote control , does he have all the 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
820.69	you could expect .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	expect	[]	[]	[]
931.85	Of course I'll buy the banana .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1143.28	So and last question , will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[Mando]
1222.69	Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1242.17	So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
1246.41	We can had uh have a out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1366.71	Let's go ahead .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1401.78	Okay so I'll remove it .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	remove	[]	[]	[]
1608.19	So mayb in fact n we have to put two here 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	mayb	[]	[]	[]
1643.59	Um we'll invest in R. and D. .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	invest	[]	[]	[R., D.]
1653.6	So we can go to through to project evaluation .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1674.27	None of us will buy it .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1772.02	Yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation .	IS1004d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1780.72	So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1919.38	Maybe maybe we can hassle the the 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	hassle	[]	[]	[]
274.84	Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer .	IS1006a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer]
494.26	Just to hold it .	IS1006a.B.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
612.93	I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a 	IS1006a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
619.46	like three mental states , yeah you know what I mean , we can just make it uh 	IS1006a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
659.68	But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .	IS1006a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
683.14	I usually just change channels .	IS1006a.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
64.5	Um it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
75.96	Um okay our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
128.59	I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
508.53	Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um underneath our oh , uh in your book , then don't worry about that .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
929.78	I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1259.84	Okay , do we have any s some questions for this , let's see um .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1285.94	It's kind of and then it we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , I dunno .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1401.33	But then the buttons would have to be very small .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1410.86	They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1524.11	continue with my pres presentation .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	continue	[]	[]	[]
1525.9	Um I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1695.44	Um okay , then we'll move on to the case .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
1873.46	So we uh we do want latex .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1940.94	And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2047.12	Well , but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[]
2064.26	Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2074.56	You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach .	ES2008c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
555.88	Remember you use uh different colours , and different pen widths .	TS3007a.D.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
573.22	Save it .	TS3007a.D.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
617.68	Open .	TS3007a.D.words.xml	Open	[]	[]	[]
806.31	Think you uh picked the wrong uh function .	TS3007a.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
936.57	It will do .	TS3007a.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
956.87	Let's go on then .	TS3007a.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1105.18	Yeah , I can find Uh .	TS3007a.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1175.91	Okay , I'll wrap it up quickly .	TS3007a.D.words.xml	wrap	[]	[]	[]
1187.35	And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products .	TS3007a.D.words.xml	distinguish	[]	[]	[]
1209.5	Um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth .	TS3007a.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1277.38	Look , you got some cheap uh remote controls there .	TS3007a.D.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
1292.34	uh wanna gain market share 	TS3007a.D.words.xml	gain	[]	[]	[]
1391.04	make some mock-ups , some some general ideas .	TS3007a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1395.12	And and then we can plan 	TS3007a.D.words.xml	plan	[]	[]	[]
1400.84	We can plan further , I think .	TS3007a.D.words.xml	plan	[]	[]	[]
1391.97	So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation .	ES2014c.D.words.xml	summarise	[]	[]	[]
1445.17	And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap .	ES2014c.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1468.77	So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow .	ES2014c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1477.3	Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic .	ES2014c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1481.46	And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of a banana or something like that .	ES2014c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1926.57	like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that 	ES2014c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2008.91	That should come up .	ES2014c.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
52.42	Remember , I'm an old man .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
311.02	We can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
346.22	And if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	bounce	[]	[]	[]
734.72	See what it looks like .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
830.84	I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
847.16	What i if when when we have yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's as as a marketing standard I need something to market , to make this product unique .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
879.71	Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
926.56	And I just whatever product you guys put together , we'll find a way to market it .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1087.65	I think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now , and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
1277.71	And so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1290.68	Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1416.93	Or maybe you can like have a a smell-o-rama , you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[rama]
1606.37	So I can go uh presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1647.15	Oh no we could read it from the television .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
1661.75	Yeah the the television can tell you .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1670.38	Put 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
1808.39	We can increase the cost .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
1827.85	Well I think th I think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit .	IS1002c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2001.89	You guys you guys can uh create a 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
33.78	Uh , we should save that one .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
39.07	Yeah , save in the folder .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
41.14	Save as project .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
119.81	Get up stand up .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Get	[]	[]	[]
128.48	View .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	View	[]	[]	[]
210.72	So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see oh , it's here , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
266.46	Okay , we can uh modify that later .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	modify	[]	[]	[]
496.11	Suppose so .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
522.65	Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , and the batteries can be located over there , so uh 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
680.0	Take a harder look , yeah , sure .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
868.35	Give me more .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Give	[]	[]	[]
1021.52	Click .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Click	[]	[]	[]
1040.57	So ma uh make it make it a two .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[ma]
1120.82	Turn uh turn up the volume .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
1199.4	Yeah , you can navigate .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	navigate	[]	[]	[]
1212.46	Let's start over again then .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1249.0	Save .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
1372.19	Count it .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Count	[]	[]	[]
1378.62	Well I dra uh Danny , Danny , I'll do that , because I draw the uh 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[dra, Danny, Danny]
1400.93	Hand 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Hand	[]	[]	[]
1483.69	We could lose the scroll wheel .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
1485.07	You could make it just a regular scroll wheel .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1503.55	Lose 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Lose	[]	[]	[]
1610.82	To knock the sample speaker , yeah .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	knock	[]	[]	[]
1616.43	But m yeah , course , but What we'll have .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1622.3	Let's make it thirteen or fourteen .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1679.84	And then you can and then you can add to the colours .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1692.68	You lose this one , you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[spec]
2013.39	No , add 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
2136.7	So you can draw uh see it over th on the screen .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2221.4	To make some designs , it is very easy .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2227.47	But to write it th yeah .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
2327.72	Make a r yeah .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
2544.53	Let's let's have party .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2546.93	Let's have some fun .	TS3005d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
738.52	And yeah , and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words .	ES2006b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
758.0	And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers .	ES2006b.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
846.12	And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .	ES2006b.D.words.xml	follow	[]	[]	[]
1017.91	I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um .	ES2006b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1059.79	Wait .	ES2006b.D.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
1711.56	Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , because actually I mean they're all still re young people .	ES2006b.D.words.xml	re	[]	[]	[]
2098.98	Oh so so we'll just put them i there , we we yeah , w we won't even okay .	ES2006b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2160.15	To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good .	ES2006b.D.words.xml	prepare	[]	[]	[]
231.61	I'll try and draw my favourite animal .	ES2008a.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
239.09	I'll I should leave that one on there shouldn't I before I callously rub it off .	ES2008a.C.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
573.0	I find them they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if I'm watching T.V. I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the T.V. , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well .	ES2008a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V., digital]
588.15	And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume .	ES2008a.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
783.99	Can I ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television 	ES2008a.C.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
833.0	So we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control .	ES2008a.C.words.xml	assume	[]	[]	[]
657.09	Buy a fifty cents battery and uh 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	Buy	[]	[]	[]
684.9	Or do you think it Rubber casing , yeah .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
700.58	Um , well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
766.38	It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	bounce	[]	[]	[]
793.52	Do your thing .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
927.42	It'll float .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	float	[]	[]	[]
1104.39	When your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1113.53	Take it .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
1190.75	Um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
1201.4	And uh make the menu structure changeable .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1203.59	So if you press um system , that's Yeah , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or or one , can fit in .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1229.63	And um well , how do uh do we want to look at uh uh f um Yeah Does a remote look Well , it's you've gotta hold it in one hand .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1238.72	So um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1254.35	So you can make it s a little broader .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1259.82	And maybe use your thumb 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1264.45	And use your other hands 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1289.48	So you can use it in uh in this way .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1297.88	One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1303.92	Um , know that if you are changing the menu structure here , um 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1319.62	Just keep it as simple as uh as possible .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1511.56	You c may use like when there's uh X.P. , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[X.P.]
1522.04	To log in .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	log	[]	[]	[]
1590.79	Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1604.58	Just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles or something .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1695.15	Yeah , the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all , will have to decide uh 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1845.48	W you can put it on chip anyway , so uh 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1877.87	So we should make it too complex .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1879.88	Is t some menu uh function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	emerge	[]	[]	[]
1908.4	You can put on Yeah .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1910.72	And you can just uh s when you buy it , you can select um personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
2013.21	Uh , or make it ourselves very diffic 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2273.42	Well , you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they'll still remember it .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
2358.73	Stay here and 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	Stay	[]	[]	[]
2390.92	See you .	TS3007c.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
287.73	Just press the arrow keys I think .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
633.32	Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[Corinne]
642.24	'Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	approach	[]	[]	[Kay]
672.05	To look at similar devices .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
710.73	You have to set them , reset them to everything .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	reset	[]	[]	[]
712.9	Um and that would only add buttons .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
723.33	Um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
818.64	So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	concentrate	[]	[]	[]
821.9	And then and change the fashion of remote controls .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1299.56	It'll wear off .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	wear	[]	[]	[]
1457.0	I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1467.48	Um that you you should put it back in .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1486.96	The ball could sit on a 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[]
1647.77	I'll yeah I'll have a look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1656.08	I th I I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2192.9	So you'd have your , you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2197.35	And then your thumb would do you'd have all the buttons sort of round here .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2213.37	Minimise its size .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	Minimise	[]	[]	[]
2376.32	How well it'll work yeah .	ES2016b.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
27.5	It does look very cool .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
200.98	It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
266.08	Ah , you did get that in then , mm-hmm .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[mm]
307.38	On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	mute	[]	[]	[]
469.61	Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
486.09	Yes , I did have A. , B. , C. , and D. down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[A., B., C., D.]
581.4	If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
640.12	I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
644.69	So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R.S.I. issue .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	negate	[]	[]	[R.S.I.]
709.09	So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
734.32	To make it beep .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
790.05	So , should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive , but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it , but you might have to think about it first .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
828.79	Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B. thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	guess	[]	[]	[B.]
958.0	That's it , they can take it with them .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1184.86	Yeah , you might end up having to take off the 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	end	[]	[]	[]
1275.8	Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1294.87	We can afford to get rid of it .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	afford	[]	[]	[]
1341.67	See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[pushbutton]
1420.15	Could b still put them on the side .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1598.05	If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1654.29	That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1670.74	Okay , cover up the microphone .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	cover	[]	[]	[]
1701.85	We could make some little 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1738.39	I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	attack	[]	[]	[]
1914.64	We could draw animals on the board again .	ES2006d.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
591.33	And it should fit the hand .	IS1004b.C.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
905.45	Change the channels .	IS1004b.C.words.xml	Change	[]	[]	[]
1303.19	it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing .	IS1004b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert]
1327.06	Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces .	IS1004b.C.words.xml	afford	[]	[]	[]
1361.22	So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons .	IS1004b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1401.64	Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc 	IS1004b.C.words.xml	target	[somewhere ninety seven]	[]	[]
1506.31	So there is A.S.R. decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format .	IS1004b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[A.S.R.]
1531.94	So th an A.S.R. decoder we can have things in .	IS1004b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1535.96	To have different technologies .	IS1004b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2319.43	So it shows you the target , config the clock , whatever else .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	config	[]	[]	[]
2322.05	Um and then we can easy add I.D.s for the two mouse points and the two gazes .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
2485.8	But you can still ta you can still track what parts went into it .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	track	[]	[]	[]
2488.42	So you can still find triangle one , whatever .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[triangle]
2561.26	But I can easily add it to give that information if you want .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
2812.7	But what what what but what you can do well if in the in the initial configuration you can re-use a triangle .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
3097.46	The result the t what you need for a join action you need to yeah , a construct and a part , two parts , whate whatever you're taking together .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	whate	[]	[]	[]
3108.59	Um and you can still track the children of that construct .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	track	[]	[]	[]
3840.26	So you can you decide whatever quality you want .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
4101.97	Line in .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	Line	[]	[]	[]
4103.14	Uh sp going going through a line in .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	sp	[]	[]	[]
4107.38	But it's still , think , yeah .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
4197.06	But then you'd have to pull the two pull the two sounds together .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
4225.9	You just write read read file one , read file two .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
4237.78	Yeah , but then the the the MATLAB the MATLAB script will tell you how l it will tell you how far apart they are .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[MATLAB, MATLAB]
4241.82	'Cause you can do you can just measure the drift between the two of them .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	measure	[]	[]	[]
4366.33	So the colour the colour can do it .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
4463.58	So you can say right , I just want so you can say from the time where they picked up triangle one to the part time it became part of the assembly , find out how it's how m percentages of time they were looking at it or whatever .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
4837.44	So we'll we'll get we'll get the get the audio stuff tested , you know , single microphones .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
4842.97	Get that tested next couple days and I assu I assume that's not something you need me for t in terms of that .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	Get	[next couple days]	[]	[]
5089.82	But yeah , I'll make sure .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
5091.02	But ho hopefully it will run smoothly and yeah , I can relax .	EN2009d.D.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[]
80.74	Ah of course , how to to design this uh this yeah .	IS1006b.A.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
99.19	So wait a minute .	IS1006b.A.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
357.31	Okay uh tha that's look great .	IS1006b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
704.34	Wait a second .	IS1006b.A.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
751.32	Let's go .	IS1006b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1247.33	Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1491.36	To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .	IS1006b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1550.98	And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or mm .	IS1006b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1607.84	Uh train it , okay .	IS1006b.A.words.xml	train	[]	[]	[]
1792.77	Sho to to train , okay .	IS1006b.A.words.xml	Sho	[]	[]	[]
1873.2	And we can increase this the strength y you can buy one with 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
1920.89	Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1928.61	we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
1953.78	you will focus on the component concept um 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
2015.96	O okay , we can think about that .	IS1006b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2056.25	Think 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
13.85	Anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
26.15	Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert]
54.7	Let me we've got forty minutes .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
65.14	Let's hope the pen holds out .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
578.75	Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to you can sit down , but just we might need you to leap up .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1013.84	Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1032.45	If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1127.73	That's over on the interface , if if you could put 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1214.16	And then you can flip it open .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	flip	[]	[]	[]
1304.17	Yeah , and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
1337.91	You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1453.65	Yeah , rub off some of those .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	rub	[]	[]	[]
1488.09	Pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1493.31	I'd I'd keep it on .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1533.12	Yeah , and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1886.54	Shall we go for if we're going for rubber , we think uh on as our case , and then 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2117.11	In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , which I'll presume he'll work out what that means .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	presume	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
2126.33	Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer, Marketing, Expert]
2171.42	Unplug yourself .	ES2006c.C.words.xml	Unplug	[]	[]	[]
447.99	you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing .	ES2016a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
627.66	And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting .	ES2016a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
876.06	'Kay , I'll draw something .	ES2016a.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[Kay]
894.82	We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way .	ES2016a.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
383.3	he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like um powerful , strong , uh I dunno .	IS1004a.D.words.xml	hide	[]	[]	[]
79.54	We can have a good look at that .	ES2014d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
126.71	It it'd probably have to be labelled mute .	ES2014d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
798.99	But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery .	ES2014d.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
937.04	Yeah , I'd maybe give it a 	ES2014d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1062.63	I would give it more than a four .	ES2014d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1375.08	And it does have attributes that other products do .	ES2014d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1380.05	Go for it .	ES2014d.C.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1451.33	we'll probably have to re-rate it .	ES2014d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1500.3	Because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .	ES2014d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1629.54	Yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit .	ES2014d.C.words.xml	stand	[]	[]	[]
2500.33	kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing .	ES2014d.C.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
580.8	Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
606.17	Uh yeah yeah , I'll go , sure .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
656.02	And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
678.89	And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T.V. or uh a stereo or something , and those uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared , so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T.V. should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that's that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V., Bluetooth, T.V., Bluetooth]
714.1	Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure , so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
766.77	Yeah , I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
773.95	So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem , but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
799.17	Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
808.51	I figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
966.81	Um , well we should uh look into the design and the functionability .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
970.39	Like I said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions , or well uh just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh stuff .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1357.75	Yeah , but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1596.64	You just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make uh several you can also improve uh later on .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1821.54	Uh I do agree , because well , it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button , but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
2026.16	I actually use one of those when They are they are kinda kinda troublesome , but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes , because uh in order for the remote to process something from the T.V. , like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive , and that's well 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	process	[]	[]	[T.V.]
2148.72	Yeah , firmware upgrade .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	upgrade	[]	[]	[]
2177.19	Yeah , maybe something like service cen Or you could well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection .	TS3007b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2203.08	Well then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in , we could actually look at into it , but I dunno , it it would be uh bringing more costs uh with with it and 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
748.63	We we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works .	IS1002d.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1092.6	D you must have very long shirts .	IS1002d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1138.12	Use them like that .	IS1002d.C.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
346.73	Drop it .	TS3005c.D.words.xml	Drop	[]	[]	[]
947.98	So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself .	TS3005c.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
983.82	The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff .	TS3005c.D.words.xml	strawberry	[]	[]	[]
1067.15	We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes .	TS3005c.D.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1165.92	Look something like that .	TS3005c.D.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
1172.48	So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour .	TS3005c.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1234.77	Or or wh what's something harder .	TS3005c.D.words.xml	wh	[]	[]	[]
1253.6	Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in .	TS3005c.D.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
1396.49	Use a pen You you c you can lose the pen .	TS3005c.D.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
1421.08	Yeah , you can buy those at 	TS3005c.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1471.79	then you can re you can uh change them .	TS3005c.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1689.12	You can put it on your table with the L.C.D. screen , you don't have to put it get it in your hand , you can put it next to you and then dive it in and .	TS3005c.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1720.0	And load it on the the user the server .	TS3005c.D.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
491.16	The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
508.45	The design should minimise R.S.I. and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	minimise	[]	[]	[R.S.I.]
525.04	Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
528.81	I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
539.13	We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up , and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
555.19	Yes , we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
595.77	Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
602.78	So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	separate	[]	[]	[]
621.47	How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
638.81	I'll just go this way .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
680.8	I would give that a three .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
714.96	So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
770.76	We'll just put almost two , because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
775.66	Or we or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
818.61	So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
848.03	Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	minimise	[]	[]	[]
946.41	I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T.V. .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1033.08	on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1053.57	I'll just leave it there .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
1196.93	So it can rest .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	rest	[]	[]	[]
1294.34	Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1515.68	We can put in our recommendations .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1517.1	If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1539.81	Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	offer	[]	[]	[]
1619.4	kick off meeting , .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	kick	[]	[]	[]
1703.15	And I've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1806.77	Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2045.79	It's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want .	ES2004d.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
414.69	if uh that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but I don't know about uh I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	appeal	[]	[]	[]
681.52	It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
696.07	So , I mean , you know , I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	link	[]	[]	[]
885.64	to use as a speech recognition engine , so 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
891.51	So if we can just move on to the next slide , I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking uh remote control 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
921.43	But um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of , you know , I think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing , so .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
935.54	But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , because it's it's the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response , so .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
951.08	But um , I've also included this turbo button because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , and well so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the T.V. is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
976.44	Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
986.17	Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
993.94	Yeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them and you know , it's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
1011.57	So yeah , that's um , those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote , but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1022.89	You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
1055.96	I mean we could have well , I guess you need an on and off switch , but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1116.29	Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	handle	[]	[]	[]
1127.16	Well that's its current application , I would presume that it's kind of , they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	presume	[]	[]	[]
1152.13	But um I did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about um being able to find the remote control and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1318.38	could be uh quite a stylish uh option , if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some , some varnish on .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1338.79	Yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1348.2	And I mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1421.98	like with a banana you can have 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1444.72	roll it back and forth like that , but with uh I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	roll	[]	[]	[]
1611.19	Cause that , you know , that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	Cause	[]	[]	[]
1717.17	Although you do need to include R.F. kind of circuitry in the remote .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[R.F.]
1754.84	You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver .	IS1004c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
940.42	So we can keep that in mind .	TS3009a.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
971.43	Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things .	TS3009a.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
988.31	Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and 	TS3009a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1091.12	Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end .	TS3009a.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1186.88	Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them , and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs I dunno but 	TS3009a.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1359.77	Well you can make profit with them , and it's a way to make them trendy .	TS3009a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1450.6	get 	TS3009a.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
957.11	Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1062.87	Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	translate	[]	[]	[]
1145.76	amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	amplify	[]	[]	[]
1206.16	we could use for the case material plastic , 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1217.13	That would that would serve that purpose .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	serve	[]	[]	[]
1220.06	Um we could also use wood , or titanium .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1234.37	However our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so I assume , I'm , I was given an okay to use it .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[]
1261.04	Can also mix these .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	mix	[]	[]	[]
1271.97	Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1287.5	Um we could use solar cells .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1302.62	m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
1325.62	May fail though , every here and there .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	fail	[May]	[]	[]
1341.85	Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[kinetic, energy]
1406.97	This however may exclude certain um materials .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	exclude	[]	[]	[]
1470.2	Let's see now .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1577.74	You can have an L.C.D. screen .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1584.56	So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	plastic	[]	[]	[]
1589.42	With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1608.21	So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an L.C.D. screen , and um 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1616.95	then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1623.45	Um if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1629.03	Add an L.C.D. screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	Add	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1632.36	Or make it just push-buttons .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1744.12	Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , but uh give it like the surface of 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
1885.65	Hang on .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	Hang	[]	[]	[]
1927.89	Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
1942.44	We can still do that .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1948.91	So um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	limit	[]	[]	[]
1960.53	Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an L.C.D. screen and so on so on .	ES2016c.B.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1966.76	You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
148.13	I think , you might have to disconnect Rose .	ES2008b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Rose]
888.39	Ah-ha , look at that , showing up already .	ES2008b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
936.41	Though th the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function .	ES2008b.B.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
984.62	So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points 	ES2008b.B.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[]
1027.8	Um the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing , is gonna be crucial .	ES2008b.B.words.xml	happen	[]	[]	[Ian]
1123.15	So you have your energy source , your user interface who's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver .	ES2008b.B.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[red]
1561.08	To produce it , yeah .	ES2008b.B.words.xml	produce	[]	[]	[]
1616.66	They could have a crap remote that came with their T.V. that's just impossible to use , or maybe it broke , or maybe they're just missing it .	ES2008b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
2055.75	But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod .	ES2008b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[iPod]
2063.16	You could we could maybe do that instead .	ES2008b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2070.0	I dunno , that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place .	ES2008b.B.words.xml	contribute	[]	[]	[]
148.77	So , that's uh that's a big l so let's uh wait it uh um we have we have must uh , we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh yeah , quite a lot of mathematics .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
180.01	I would g give the word to um G. and G. for the prototype presentation .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[G., G.]
416.82	Weemote .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	Weemote	[]	[]	[]
431.56	Yeah , I can imagine that .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
881.51	Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
903.05	uh , w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls , there may uh uh be there in your uh T.V. room , this one will stand out , I think .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	stand	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1155.33	Yeah , if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro , uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation , as we have uh experienced it .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[Euro, ra]
1166.61	Otherwise , we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1177.88	We have to uh fil uh , want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[Euro]
1337.51	The kinetic thing , can we just skip it , because uh you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
1403.8	And then w yeah , and then we could have it , but uh it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1430.67	Fill in Just a 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	Fill	[]	[]	[]
1435.42	I can delete it for you if you want .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	delete	[]	[]	[]
1521.46	Well , now you can shake your remote control .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	shake	[]	[]	[]
1547.69	Who because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	go	[thirteen and a half]	[]	[]
1752.78	get better and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk yeah .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1790.96	Now you you must push a little while .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
2199.22	You can go uh 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2212.57	to use .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2213.66	And that's a pity , if you uh if you have uh thirty , forty minutes uh for this kind of things , and we are now with four people , but it well , imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone uh 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
2387.77	Maybe we can do it uh together .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2391.31	So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2491.48	Yeah , I understand you , I can talk a little bit Dutch .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
2516.04	Well , maybe I can then do it one two three .	TS3007d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2533.4	Uh , well all the things we have uh discussed , uh the energy , which uh turn out to be uh batteries , so that's 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
2599.65	Okay , but so we can discuss that uh 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
2602.72	we can discuss that kind of things I think with the 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
74.04	we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
97.15	So start , uh 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
124.38	Turn .	IS1005c.A.words.xml	Turn	[]	[]	[]
857.12	For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem .	IS1005c.A.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
941.46	Let's go .	IS1005c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1011.58	So maybe you can finish your presentation , and afterwards we will discuss about all this .	IS1005c.A.words.xml	finish	[]	[]	[]
1128.18	At least when there is T.V. you can get light from the T.V. .	IS1005c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
1495.27	Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana .	IS1005c.A.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
1635.39	rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or .	IS1005c.A.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
1924.73	And think we are on a good way .	IS1005c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1933.41	uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes .	IS1005c.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1938.61	Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design .	IS1005c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[Industrial, Manager]
1950.35	The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device .	IS1005c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Mana, Manager]
1961.17	And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation .	IS1005c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert]
1976.68	uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype , and uh 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[Hamed, Peter]
1994.81	And um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on .	IS1005c.A.words.xml	receive	[]	[]	[]
63.5	So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh um 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
75.97	well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	sacrifice	[]	[]	[]
101.51	Might have to hit function F. eight but it looks like it's gonna come up .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[F.]
293.78	Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Developer]
325.04	Um hit function F. eight real quickly , hold down 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
403.9	Oh yeah look at that .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
491.76	Give it a little bit .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	Give	[]	[]	[]
615.66	So um yep I'll just uh switch that back here .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
619.52	I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	finish	[]	[]	[]
650.89	Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , um so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is um we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Sarah]
689.65	So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
722.28	How th this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	balance	[]	[]	[]
909.33	Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	aim	[]	[]	[Mm]
960.22	The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	face	[]	[]	[]
1021.44	Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X. and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Nokia, X.]
1047.57	Alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1056.99	True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	cross	[]	[]	[]
1090.34	Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1097.64	built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1125.44	Um do we have 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1191.84	Well yeah I mean you can put the we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1206.92	Okay so we'll touch screen and the battery , focus on um uh presentation .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	touch	[]	[]	[]
1376.89	Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
1388.19	Oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode .	ES2009b.A.words.xml	wake	[]	[]	[]
119.67	Come now , it's not full over there .	IB4004.C.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
490.21	Uh remember Andrei , that was uh yeah yeah .	IB4004.C.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[Andrei]
1218.69	But also to read articles .	IB4004.C.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
1341.08	No , wait a minute , yeah .	IB4004.C.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1392.9	But wait a minute , then Andrei has a two person office all for himself .	IB4004.C.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[Andrei]
1568.03	Oterwise , we might uh lose room or two .	IB4004.C.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
2203.84	No , get the uh for the the bigger rooms you get double for every workplace you get two lines .	IB4004.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2286.11	Yeah , they'll just give us a date when 	IB4004.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2337.75	Some people can pick it up on sixth floor .	IB4004.C.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
855.48	Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
885.23	And I'll show you my findings .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
918.59	Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , you know who's famous , what T.V. shows are being watched , um , to influence our remote control .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	influence	[]	[]	[T.V.]
942.41	Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
1005.38	And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1159.68	How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1186.15	designers can look into that .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1193.71	But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1208.27	A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	pay	[]	[]	[]
1212.3	So I'll show you some numbers here .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
1247.9	Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	pay	[]	[]	[]
1341.83	Um an L.C.D. screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	shift	[]	[]	[L.C.D., li, PowerPoint]
1358.44	You'd have an L.C.D. versus just a , a normal clock .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1443.38	I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	go	[fifteen to twenty five years olds]	[]	[]
1470.75	I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	pay	[sixteen year old, three months]	[]	[]
1571.31	Maybe we can do the 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1582.83	Oh , come back screen .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
2117.91	It the it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	glow	[]	[]	[]
2196.38	I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
2220.02	You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on .	ES2015b.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
56.66	Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but I will do .	ES2005d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
407.62	that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened .	ES2005d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
514.47	Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
686.29	You're all get you're all getting a raise .	ES2005d.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
699.93	Let's buy more .	ES2005d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
748.36	Uh Let's see if I can get this bloody thing to work .	ES2005d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
819.82	O okay , hold on .	ES2005d.C.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
1192.21	Oh , I'll go for a one .	ES2005d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1226.9	Come on that was the tha 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
1572.87	Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
191.2	Uh I I will focus on user interface design .	IS1003b.D.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
195.01	Um so move to the next slide .	IS1003b.D.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
257.12	Um so move to next s slide .	IS1003b.D.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
761.48	Design a wireless remote control .	IS1003b.D.words.xml	Design	[]	[]	[]
1035.3	No you you can have a switch menu , so you can 	IS1003b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1043.95	Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes .	IS1003b.D.words.xml	category	[]	[]	[]
1053.2	for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions .	IS1003b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1069.02	switch to another category of functions .	IS1003b.D.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
1073.09	For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T.V. and also you can control your uh recorder .	IS1003b.D.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1151.08	Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , so user can select which colour they prefer , so .	IS1003b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1414.87	A pi There's that box in the T.V. , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T.V. .	IS1003b.D.words.xml	connect	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
142.63	I did get a bit more done than the last time , 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
304.74	Sound .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	Sound	[]	[]	[]
556.61	I would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
574.18	Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
598.15	is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	print	[]	[]	[]
640.28	I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
674.7	Uh go ahead .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
938.37	Otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
996.31	Wait a sec .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[sec]
1096.69	Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , you know , with the 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1112.56	There is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1116.83	Maybe we should consider this function .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
1119.68	To customise it and so I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people who want something , you know , different , or more uh design , they can go for one colour like uh for example this uh photo th camera .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	customise	[]	[]	[]
1203.49	To make something new .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1205.19	I would go for the double curved .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1234.62	You can make a trigger button or something like that .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1239.18	Yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something , that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	confirm	[]	[]	[]
1340.8	No uh like I would draw it like this .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1346.9	Let's say this is the side view .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1349.32	That you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1356.37	So that it would come up like that .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1362.45	Yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1407.37	But you can make a , yeah , you can make a trigger here .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1443.27	That actually will offer some extra protection for the 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	offer	[]	[]	[]
1479.92	Yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1487.17	And maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1491.22	Give it I would give it a female shape but uh yeah .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	Give	[]	[]	[]
1500.15	Make it more appealing to guys .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1530.94	You can place the screen here , which can come .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	place	[]	[]	[]
1541.14	I would do the arrows here , kind of thing .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1585.42	Yeah we could make 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1594.79	We should use 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1873.69	Do you get a pop-up if we 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1903.58	But if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1959.71	You can what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1968.82	So that the whole button will shine 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	shine	[]	[]	[]
1977.77	And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
2081.78	Shall we uh make a new uh 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2095.61	Yeah I'll just I'll just keep it there .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
2269.28	Wait .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
2269.47	Let me try it one more time .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2282.29	Okay , of course it will become way more ugly .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
2295.21	This'll take forever .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2331.4	Let's fill i fill in the buttons later .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2382.78	you can adjust the angle to which it flips .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	adjust	[]	[]	[]
2385.11	So it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	flip	[]	[]	[]
2388.39	You can flip it up to there if you want .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	flip	[]	[]	[]
2394.6	Think so .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
2494.82	Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[Gameboy]
2499.81	Maybe we should try something like that .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2517.76	This can go .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2526.17	Let's see .	TS3006c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
388.27	Uh well I'll try my best to draw .	ES2007a.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
450.82	And they can feel when a human's got problems so 	ES2007a.D.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
774.13	Guess 	ES2007a.D.words.xml	Guess	[]	[]	[]
1038.73	I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and ooh , the telephone's the television switched on or something .	ES2007a.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1055.92	does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something .	ES2007a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1065.91	But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it .	ES2007a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1068.63	So make it Yeah .	ES2007a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
577.82	Yeah , to navigate .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	navigate	[]	[]	[]
613.53	Uh and and you can hold it , you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
629.54	If we have enough place , uh then we can do that .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
677.15	That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
717.72	Just remember where it was .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
765.2	Mm most new T.V.s do uh collect all the pages .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	collect	[]	[]	[Mm, T.V.s]
825.2	Okay , just leave it .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
826.15	Just leave it .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
855.12	Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
863.99	That shall show it .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
936.15	We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
999.25	Ho how do we make uh 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Ho]
1078.57	And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1151.0	So I'll give it a 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1155.48	Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1167.52	Yeah , we shall test it But uh 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	test	[]	[]	[]
1243.05	So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	wheel	[]	[]	[]
1249.94	You must slide it .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	slide	[]	[]	[]
1509.97	Call 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	Call	[]	[]	[]
1541.68	I did save it .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1583.2	Come on , it's perfect .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
1721.78	We could make a lot of different uh remote controls .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1827.13	Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
1951.8	To gather , or to uh 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	gather	[]	[]	[]
1956.76	work together , uh or new ideas for 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
2049.72	I should take some pictures uh .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2059.28	Let's play minesweeper .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2298.22	Just pick one .	TS3004d.D.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
2473.42	'Kay wait , I'm going to draw something and you must y 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[Kay]
55.15	Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	thi	[]	[]	[]
282.71	To integrate , you know yeah .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[]
288.18	You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the the in 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[]
566.34	I will give I will 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
569.49	I'll gi 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	gi	[]	[]	[]
573.95	I'll give two or three .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
868.03	To compensate .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	compensate	[]	[]	[]
889.25	Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	vote	[]	[]	[]
895.06	Will you give 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1032.52	I'll put four .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1038.46	You can you can erase with this er yeah .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	erase	[]	[]	[]
1400.98	I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have yeah .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	remove	[]	[]	[]
1418.82	We can transform the double curve into single c yeah .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	transform	[]	[]	[]
1735.72	We can think about T.V. with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1742.24	Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1749.49	Yeah , you can keep the global appearan 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1816.59	Yeah , right , go and sell it .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1887.54	Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R. 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[R.]
1941.53	Yeah I will try I'll try .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1946.54	I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2010.14	So we can celebrate now .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	celebrate	[]	[]	[]
2026.79	Well , I'll buy one here .	IS1003d.B.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
111.33	I just got a few slides , so show them .	ES2015d.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
214.2	Yeah because if you on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve .	ES2015d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
230.53	So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two .	ES2015d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
353.76	It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though .	ES2015d.B.words.xml	cause	[]	[]	[]
532.43	Mm go 	ES2015d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Mm]
663.52	Feel I think .	ES2015d.B.words.xml	Feel	[]	[]	[]
916.78	I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours .	ES2015d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
999.61	Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user .	ES2015d.B.words.xml	match	[]	[]	[]
1049.94	Yeah l lights on and , or flash as well .	ES2015d.B.words.xml	flash	[]	[]	[]
1075.22	Well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went .	ES2015d.B.words.xml	light	[]	[]	[]
1184.86	We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about .	ES2015d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1663.29	So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it .	ES2015d.B.words.xml	wh	[]	[]	[]
1723.2	So that did limit 	ES2015d.B.words.xml	limit	[]	[]	[]
1880.77	Well mm , did it come into the into I dunno if we counted that in the costs .	ES2015d.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
104.77	No can that open .	TS3008b.B.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
110.66	Open it there .	TS3008b.B.words.xml	Open	[]	[]	[]
379.68	Yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it .	TS3008b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
446.38	Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel .	TS3008b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
488.58	M you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that .	TS3008b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1208.68	keep it simple and look more at th 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1293.4	Will you look 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1297.39	Look at the market .	TS3008b.B.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
1508.63	To find him .	TS3008b.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1601.58	And use friendly , yeah .	TS3008b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1918.44	Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down .	TS3008b.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1976.88	And you can leave it just there .	TS3008b.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
2029.41	Can you make an uh uh 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2106.21	Oh , uh look uh look at the pictures .	TS3008b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2218.04	You know look at the front , but 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
287.69	Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v yeah , yeah .	ES2007c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
307.57	You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days .	ES2007c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
317.5	Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
347.93	Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really .	ES2007c.B.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
378.33	You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
432.98	But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything .	ES2007c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
487.03	And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L.C.D. , which gives you a display .	ES2007c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
507.0	So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons .	ES2007c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
603.77	Let's go crazy .	ES2007c.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
831.55	Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose .	ES2007c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
837.1	So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
854.32	So we'll go for the battery .	ES2007c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1503.52	Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now .	ES2007c.B.words.xml	enable	[]	[]	[Bluetooth]
1582.79	Change the batteries ever again .	ES2007c.B.words.xml	Change	[]	[]	[]
1734.06	Well yeah , but Apple would sue you for that .	ES2007c.B.words.xml	sue	[]	[]	[Apple]
1980.41	And produce less of the silly colours , maybe .	ES2007c.B.words.xml	produce	[]	[]	[]
842.62	I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune .	IS1005a.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
83.57	to make uh uh a new remote control for television .	IS1007a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
109.94	So people can can use it without any 	IS1007a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
652.21	Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons .	IS1007a.A.words.xml	optimise	[]	[]	[]
716.18	Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we 	IS1007a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
776.28	Be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the .	IS1007a.A.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[]
911.03	And we'll discuss the other other aspects .	IS1007a.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
20.75	Think we all 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
267.06	Think she's finishing up her presentation .	ES2007b.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
484.87	Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	win	[]	[]	[]
714.39	Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .	ES2007b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
734.76	Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	improve	[]	[]	[]
794.27	So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um freeze frame .	ES2007b.C.words.xml	stop	[]	[]	[]
831.78	So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use .	ES2007b.C.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[]
1341.01	Yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .	ES2007b.C.words.xml	consult	[]	[]	[]
1354.04	I think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .	ES2007b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[ergonomic, department]
1487.67	Sell trying to sell your things .	ES2007b.C.words.xml	Sell	[]	[]	[]
201.92	Yeah we c could We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
282.57	And then just drop all the other buttons .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
316.99	Could drop the speech recognition .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
419.97	If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
427.51	With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
431.93	With the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[et]
583.56	Let's make the Let's make the case plastic .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
807.0	drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
878.53	Just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
912.19	Oh just oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[ma]
1181.68	Or give it a colour .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1747.29	Wait a second .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
1767.47	Just count it to Yeah .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	count	[]	[]	[]
1944.5	Yeah we we can just uh use this one .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2270.22	Do they have a lo Oh , the here .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2541.86	Yeah , can we t can we get to that i 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2609.55	So cake .	TS3006d.B.words.xml	cake	[]	[]	[]
840.98	And you can have them at home .	TS3008a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
901.5	You can handle them .	TS3008a.C.words.xml	handle	[]	[]	[]
1129.56	Uh , to go with to go with fashion and 	TS3008a.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
677.66	Do , do those calculators yeah .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
781.9	Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
845.84	Do you think it's 	ES2015c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
859.68	So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
917.88	Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
929.71	I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
934.08	But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points , as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
980.33	Um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
989.73	You know , make it more trendy and original .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
991.33	We'll have more money if we keep it simple .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1047.87	And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	learn	[]	[]	[]
1148.78	So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1611.55	Just escape I think .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	escape	[]	[]	[]
1672.8	Hope so .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	Hope	[]	[]	[]
1843.32	w where where shall we locate the buttons .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	locate	[]	[]	[]
1967.88	It w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else , just have an audio button though .	ES2015c.C.words.xml	seem	[]	[]	[]
945.78	So if they're noisy , that could disrupt the quiet of the lounge .	IB4005.B.words.xml	disrupt	[]	[]	[]
1286.32	Is it is it something that's a very valued thing that has to be protected , um , or is it okay to l make it be kind of this spare space that gets used up a little bit when you need when you have some extra visitors or things like that .	IB4005.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1439.92	So what does that mean , Swedish um 	IB4005.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1455.01	Just S. , uh so just to know who they are , okay .	IB4005.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[S.]
1660.82	Do you know if it's possible .	IB4005.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1681.78	And so you can fit that , you think .	IB4005.B.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1751.75	You mean Maybe you should break the wall between the men's room and the women's room .	IB4005.B.words.xml	break	[]	[]	[]
1956.26	You know , it's good to have some numbers , if you can come up with some numbers uh 	IB4005.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
105.24	So uh first I will present the concept of user interface .	IS1003c.C.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[]
128.66	Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller .	IS1003c.C.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[Google]
150.85	The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	recognise	[]	[]	[]
193.53	Or to recognise it , yeah .	IS1003c.C.words.xml	recognise	[]	[]	[]
206.29	We want uh we want our controller to be smart , so maybe we should uh use um uh 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
305.88	So you can use your gesture .	IS1003c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
473.13	It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .	IS1003c.C.words.xml	recognise	[]	[France]	[French]
506.87	Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
549.03	Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here .	IS1003c.C.words.xml	embed	[]	[]	[]
643.72	We should have confidence in technology .	IS1003c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
717.27	Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	replace	[]	[]	[]
737.51	You can replace your T.V. with a new T.V. with internet browsing function , but 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	replace	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
762.2	Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .	IS1003c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
973.67	Yeah , maybe we can first come to 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
979.25	With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , then present it later .	IS1003c.C.words.xml	prepare	[]	[Frahan]	[]
931.45	We'll put price up at the top .	ES2013d.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1036.54	Should we go with the yellow in terms of I think that's a really superior they're both 	ES2013d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1122.09	Oh , pardon me .	ES2013d.D.words.xml	pardon	[]	[]	[]
1799.65	I can give you a number , um it's uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out .	ES2013d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1809.67	There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two .	ES2013d.D.words.xml	pardon	[]	[]	[]
1840.9	To maintain old technology , exactly .	ES2013d.D.words.xml	maintain	[]	[]	[]
1874.28	So we might have to wait .	ES2013d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
135.16	alt delete .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	alt	[]	[]	[]
326.82	Yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
357.39	Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
367.24	So forget this one .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	forget	[]	[]	[]
451.18	Yeah well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
494.12	So it's the people can say , well what's that , well that's my remote control , so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
670.95	Yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
769.85	So we we can go for 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
784.38	So we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1077.62	Uh you can make a if you make a drawing .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1095.58	And draw it very big .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1121.62	Yeah so it should fit right in into your hand .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1139.4	Um then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top I guess .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1163.8	Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1379.59	So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1426.4	I mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	channel	[]	[]	[]
1475.8	Yeah just oh y you have digital uh better write it down over there yeah .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1583.1	I will look it up .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1660.14	Uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
1673.45	Well most T.V.s automatically display the name , which they get through the cable .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[T.V.s]
1708.55	Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
1722.76	Just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	browse	[]	[]	[]
1819.8	I mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says , uh on which number do you want to save this , and you just press a number on your remote , and then say confirm , okay , and then it's it's saved .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1831.32	It's easier , it's it's it's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to to swap .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	swap	[]	[]	[]
1966.97	Or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
1973.98	Um so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	exit	[]	[]	[]
2024.55	So you l should leave the menu button out of here .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
2028.34	And and just put it under the screen , the screen 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2071.45	Yeah , or confirm and back .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	confirm	[]	[]	[]
2088.24	That that just to to activate the screen .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	activate	[]	[]	[]
2095.48	And then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	woa	[]	[]	[]
2128.94	Yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2166.79	And maybe we should use this also as an okay button , still .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2264.75	Yeah we'll kick your ass later .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	kick	[]	[]	[]
2270.22	Aye 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	Aye	[]	[]	[]
2283.06	Just put back my laptop .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2287.34	Yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that .	TS3006b.D.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
177.85	So uh you can have my project in 	IS1001d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
197.3	So you can go .	IS1001d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
200.0	We can go through .	IS1001d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
216.87	So you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points .	IS1001d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
244.88	So I go through all the uh all the points here , and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point .	IS1001d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
569.44	But wha why why don't they have any representative here .	IB4003.D.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[]
612.19	It's Suppose that somebody for some strange reasons want to be in the corner and we don't know about that , we'll put them put her or him somewhere else , then we will do plenty of work for nothing , because we'll not have this constraint .	IB4003.D.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
841.71	But uh and uh what might happen , but it uh it will not be so heavy here uh at ISSCO is visitors .	IB4003.D.words.xml	happen	[]	[]	[ISSCO]
850.74	So that I will have more at E.P.F.L. , uh typically students coming in um or asking for things .	IB4003.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[E.P.F.L.]
1054.48	They will change .	IB4003.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1066.12	Yeah , they will promote that .	IB4003.D.words.xml	promote	[]	[]	[]
1169.25	And this will happen .	IB4003.D.words.xml	happen	[]	[]	[]
1278.67	We can discuss with people that the the space is very small , I mean , altogether it's 	IB4003.D.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1402.47	But uh you can get them through a proposal .	IB4003.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1419.68	They would um p prefer to be in another room .	IB4003.D.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
1471.98	Maybe you could put some visitors , but um 	IB4003.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1553.34	Then we could very very simply uh allocate the one pers one of the one person rooms for the admin .	IB4003.D.words.xml	allocate	[]	[]	[]
1559.21	And that would solve the problem .	IB4003.D.words.xml	solve	[]	[]	[]
1628.48	I mean uh , maybe you can do that with an exchange student , that's 	IB4003.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1720.17	I can tell you according to what I know now where I would like or would be ready to be , but I really don't see how I could decide for uh Maggie or Pierrette or whoever else on the list , that they should be there .	IB4003.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[Maggie, Pierrette]
1747.73	And then you will have this multi-constraint problem and uh you work during two hours and you come up with the optimal solution .	IB4003.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1756.39	Yeah , I would I would ask for their place .	IB4003.D.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1917.19	And you can bring your coffee in the reading room .	IB4003.D.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1930.96	Wait , wai wai wai wait .	IB4003.D.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[wai, wai, wai]
1959.1	That that would be great , because that would allow us not to move , or not to travel twice .	IB4003.D.words.xml	allow	[]	[]	[]
283.15	Glow-in-the-dark .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	Glow	[]	[]	[]
495.8	Escape , okay .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	Escape	[]	[]	[]
508.08	I'll just walk you through them .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	walk	[]	[]	[]
571.48	Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
579.62	You can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
643.12	I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
702.54	It's you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that's And it's much Yeah .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
716.68	Uh personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L.C.D. , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
914.67	So okay , I'll take this out now then .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1182.84	You do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1193.76	Yeah , that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1232.29	We could make novelty remote controls .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1323.17	'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
1566.9	I quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[]
1620.37	You said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that , like have a choice .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1781.6	I mean we could make it nice pale yellow .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1794.32	Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2243.88	Oh yeah , we can do buttons .	ES2005c.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
951.67	Oh so I will speak about working design .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
960.08	A look at what the other company Okay so uh presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh I didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I.R. circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[I.R.]	[]
988.25	And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	report	[]	[]	[]
1063.74	Components to use , I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1126.35	But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	offer	[]	[]	[]
1160.6	If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	struggle	[]	[]	[]
1191.82	We will discuss it afterwards .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1200.31	And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R.W. circuit , but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I.R.s .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[R.W., I.R.s]
1484.91	You should probably speak .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
1601.97	So it requires the use of L.C.D. probably , to to tell you 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1606.57	Okay , so I'll make a note on L.C.D. .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
1692.73	Well , this would avoid L.C.D. , then .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	avoid	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1788.88	Hide them , okay .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	Hide	[]	[]	[]
1846.28	Okay , so we should keep this button .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1858.92	Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L.C.D. and all the buttons and stuff , we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the T.V. and if you close it , it will 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	p	[]	[L.C.D.]	[T.V.]
1878.23	turn off the T.V. .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1926.42	Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1943.38	Old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers .	IS1005b.B.words.xml	satisfy	[]	[]	[]
2036.27	Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T.V. , well And based on your 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[T.V.]
168.5	I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one .	ES2007d.A.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
307.52	One thing I do need to do we need to look at , is the costs .	ES2007d.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
342.96	Okay , now I think we'll do this I could do you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power .	ES2007d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
450.5	Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you .	ES2007d.A.words.xml	e	[]	[]	[]
461.77	Save it in save it in the uh my documents .	ES2007d.A.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
597.38	I would give it a seven .	ES2007d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
657.17	I would give it a I would give it a two , 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
675.9	Give it a t give it a two .	ES2007d.A.words.xml	Give	[]	[]	[]
737.86	I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	flush	[]	[]	[]
801.77	You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two .	ES2007d.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
884.15	Ex exactly that product um thum we'll go , yeah , we designed that and no-one will believe us .	ES2007d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Ex]
901.33	No , I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in .	ES2007d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1023.45	Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that , it's that it's um , hang on , I wrote it down here somewhere 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[]
1072.05	Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that .	ES2007d.A.words.xml	break	[]	[]	[]
15.12	Guess I should probably try to sit up straight .	ES2009a.B.words.xml	Guess	[]	[]	[]
645.86	Let's see .	ES2009a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
736.72	Close t uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is , and 	ES2009a.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[Clare, Lune]
912.79	Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that .	ES2009a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1178.43	something , uh we'll have to come up with a name , patent it .	ES2009a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
103.72	I'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , uh and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
494.91	And we can we can steal their ideas .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	steal	[]	[]	[]
603.98	Well we maybe we can think of that later .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
651.25	That might get redundant also maybe .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
689.63	But you do mention the next and previous uh button .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	mention	[]	[]	[]
772.47	Uh , I mean th th the the two two basic buttons , you know , the to skip channels and to uh 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
1131.03	And uh , but I do like the yeah , I do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1175.16	Yeah , on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1199.1	See what was on the agenda .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1257.5	I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1325.33	It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1341.46	You could make it , but it's just it it doesn't I don't think it it's coherent with the design we're after .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1351.2	Well , you you y Okay , we can vote for it .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	vote	[]	[]	[]
1371.35	But did we skip the Yeah , you could do m but what what i so what i but do you think we should 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
1420.93	Do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d L.C.D. displays , but then it's very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[rem, L.C.D.]
1551.21	We already we're uh Yeah , we already have the the th th th base station gadgets , and want and it uh uh , do it has to be a simple design , which sturdy , which soft 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1646.75	I'm sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1670.52	This is what it w Yeah , but it it was already what we're uh we're after , you know , to give it uh , you know , the soft touch in your hands and also to , know , like Yeah , that is y the b airbag kind of thing .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1682.72	You can st throw it at your little brother's head .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
1779.7	Maybe just bring it out in different colours , but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1846.18	It will it will break other stuff w when it's plastic , as well .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	break	[]	[]	[]
1853.99	No , but uh uh , you should ma Yeah .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	ma	[]	[]	[]
1857.55	Okay , think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1885.49	But the question is i then it's , you know , is is it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh , know , like uh 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1972.24	But make it just like shiny .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2049.03	But wha th our basic idea y I mean , you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[]
2111.85	Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
2136.96	We have we have a teletext button .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2170.79	No , you can use the 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2173.43	And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[al]
2176.19	Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem uh yeah , mute .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
2195.9	Something important about a s uh , no , uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself , I guess .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	remind	[]	[]	[]
2203.23	Just use 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2212.75	And we will make it spongy and and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did I think this is kind of fruity , you know .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[fru]
2219.45	Just round shapes with uh 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	round	[]	[]	[]
2246.08	to get to that .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2249.22	Guess we're through then .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	Guess	[]	[]	[]
2264.75	But our des design experts will uh work that out .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[des]
2272.78	So we will wrap up .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	wrap	[]	[]	[]
2284.08	Well , you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the pro probably .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
2290.57	Yeah uh no , for su for sure because I'm will now type them out .	TS3008c.A.words.xml	type	[]	[]	[su]
109.11	So welcome back .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	welcome	[]	[]	[]
137.34	You'll find the next minutes also there .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
152.63	So And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
165.28	After that we'll have lunch .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
176.93	Industrial Designer to tell what he did .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
338.37	Save as .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
350.62	Save .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
387.35	Now have ten minutes to tell it .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
590.86	Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
609.51	When you use it on the television , you've you need the television , wh which can use it .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1409.12	So But we'll come back on that .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1417.06	Oh , go on .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1532.7	So maybe you can tell us .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1695.61	Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1770.15	Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1787.64	have this 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1889.17	So we can go on to 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1917.38	So then we'll have the concepts .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1935.06	And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[Project, Documents]
1946.31	Your individual action , you can find them in the email .	TS3010b.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
374.91	So wait uh , I don't get it .	IN1005.A.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1432.28	Say another another example apart from uh this uh search .	IN1005.A.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
2306.45	Did you manage to to divide the link uh properly or 	IN1005.A.words.xml	manage	[]	[]	[]
411.97	Well I think y bu y y you can actually mark it if it isn't altering what's in the manual .	EN2006b.A.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[]
427.96	Yeah , then then do , I think .	EN2006b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
709.64	Line in it .	EN2006b.A.words.xml	Line	[]	[]	[]
980.66	Well hang on though .	EN2006b.A.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[]
1885.67	Yes , you do mean ion lines .	EN2006b.A.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
2422.81	Well hang on though , but um 	EN2006b.A.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[]
335.37	I did have a look .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
445.35	It'll really speed it up .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	speed	[]	[]	[]
512.77	Oh , keep that then .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
551.07	And then each meeting knows about all the different dialogue acts for each person in the meeting , and the amount that that occurred , and will give you that in top order as well , or will give you or you can just search for each specific dialogue act .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
566.77	Do you have to search on in B.s and K.s rather than real words right at the moment .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[B.s]	[K.s]
572.68	But I can change that .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
630.63	Either of those would do you .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
631.46	But it would start take a lot of space if you have it 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
635.42	Or you could have no , you don't need that .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
639.91	So you've got the global one there , and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
776.73	Um yeah , I just have to I'll just finish there might be some polishing .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	finish	[]	[]	[]
783.39	So I'll do that tonight .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
784.29	Just put it up there .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
784.93	So you can us start using that whenever .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
812.61	Well , I can judge it if you want .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	judge	[]	[]	[]
818.63	We could put it in a sep in a p package .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
831.01	So sod it .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	sod	[]	[]	[]
842.89	Well then you can double-click on and it oh , oh .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
853.42	Yeah , it will have something else .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
855.1	Just borrow a little Microsoft GIF like that .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	borrow	[]	[]	[Microsoft, GIF]
968.62	It could even have some sound when it comes on .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
977.5	Have to do it in the 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
1071.4	If you can make it work , then I'll be well chuffed .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1250.12	Send him an email .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	Send	[]	[]	[]
1250.7	He'll probably re-do it anyway .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	re	[]	[]	[]
1327.51	So how many people do we uh try and 'cause it 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1335.28	No , it'll take forever , and then you gotta analyse the results .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1339.14	No no no no no , forget it .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	forget	[]	[]	[]
1451.49	oh we should have it we should try and have at it done by then anyway , I think .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1454.91	Otherwise it will start to getting b bit tight otherwise .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1462.47	We should aim to be finished by Monday , this Monday coming .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	aim	[Monday, this Monday]	[]	[]
1468.85	Start the evaluation t pretty much straight-away and then get 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	Start	[]	[]	[]
1473.64	Get s yeah , and then get um 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	Get	[]	[]	[]
1508.13	And you must have your research proposal .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1996.55	It's just do topics instead of seg yeah , you have to get the topics out instead of the segments .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2079.19	Well we'll certainly do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on the Yeah , but at at the very least .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2115.07	Um I did have a look at trying to create X.M.L. files .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
2119.93	It did look like a quite a a mission really .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2142.88	But Organise it by time not by speaker .	EN2002d.C.words.xml	Organise	[]	[]	[]
358.77	Yeah , it does tend to help .	EN2004a.D.words.xml	tend	[]	[]	[]
472.16	You know , when you get like um someone's talking and there's they sort of pause in the middle of a sentence that's long enough for it to put a break in , but they're actually sort of carrying on the sentence , do you have to capitalise each time you transcribe a bit if it's mid 	EN2004a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1047.81	You know , um you standardised all the the filled pauses , the uh and do we need to go through and change ones that people did differently .	EN2004a.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1085.99	Yeah , just change it to um .	EN2004a.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
2128.2	Yeah , do it as Okay .	EN2004a.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2530.76	Have to remember that one now .	EN2004a.D.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
3104.76	Turn the page .	EN2004a.D.words.xml	Turn	[]	[]	[]
3132.2	So do we just open the file as we open the files for the first pass , like open up the sound file and then it sh 	EN2004a.D.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
3184.79	Then you'll lose it , yeah .	EN2004a.D.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
3298.49	Know what you're doing .	EN2004a.D.words.xml	Know	[]	[]	[]
20.0	See 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
22.61	On your marks , get set , go .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
125.38	Otherwise we can go onto our system and get it .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
134.74	Let's say something rude .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
232.48	Yes , if you see towards the top left of the image , you'll notice And luckily Olivia had warned me it might be complicated , and so I had something with without very many um n not little flying in and things , because that would just make it really difficult .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	notice	[]	[Olivia]	[]
273.27	And then we can start fighting about 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
336.85	So even on one we can tell .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
341.19	'Cause I would fight for line being a spectral feature as well .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	fight	[]	[]	[]
348.39	Let's do that .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
360.44	And if neither , then we'll have to put something else .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
379.48	Yeah , go ahead .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
396.06	You can point to a soft component .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
429.75	a lack of absorption , you would put it in , because we said we would put describing words .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
442.35	you would get a pencil .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
516.0	Select a 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Select	[]	[]	[]
602.31	Let's mark that then .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
642.83	Tell you who's more awake at this .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Tell	[]	[]	[]
717.48	You would point to it .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
768.24	Line again .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Line	[]	[]	[]
769.87	Line in ratios .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Line	[]	[]	[]
827.81	Damped Lyman alpha absorbers , I think that's a spectral feature even though it's 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Damped	[]	[]	[Lyman]
883.3	If it's defined by a spectral feature , we should mark it .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[]
896.69	You could point to damped Lyman alpha though .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[Lyman]
1029.82	then we would mark quasar and we would mark damped Lyman alpha .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[quasar, Lyman]
1033.88	If it was broad absorption line quasar , we'd mark it .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[]
1104.56	Let's have that for now then .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1105.38	You if if we change our mind later when we go through , we can always come back to it and say 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1402.67	No one else can read that , sorry .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
1466.63	Line feature , need that .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1520.04	But if it's a damped Lyman alpha spectrum , you'd mark damped Lyman alpha , because in the spectrum .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[Lyman, Lyman]
1611.4	Or the damped Lyman alpha feature , if you put feature there rather than data , then you'd mark it .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[Lyman]
1667.42	That's think enough .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1831.76	If it was lines from H. two you'd mark it .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[H.]
1965.03	Which , if you just said that it's Gunn-Petersen absorption from neutral hydrogen rather than i if it was a t if it was hydrogen absorption , you'd mark the whole thing .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[Gunn, Petersen]
1975.02	If it was hydrogen align you would , so you should mark if it was or H. beta absorption .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[H.]
2030.36	Let's just cross everything out .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2059.73	As in we're putting weak and strong absorption would count , so I think blue-shifted should .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	count	[]	[]	[]
2128.16	I think you probably should then , 'cause we will put in our align strength .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2132.14	Uh if it's a F. i of a two line strength we would definitely put it in .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[F.]
2213.25	Let's not mark it then .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2218.15	If it says it F.E. two line strength then we would mark it , 'cause you're talking about the line of it rather than the ev element .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[F.E.]
2259.24	Um take out line .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2310.84	And if it was mid-infrar uh if it was , you'd put it in .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2390.66	Okay , we'll just go back and change those .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2410.87	Yeah , okay , modifiers with them , which is give a yell if you see one .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2748.58	So Oh , but then a m research group could take an image .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2910.81	Scribble away .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Scribble	[]	[]	[]
2936.09	We did mark nebula , yes .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[nebula]
2966.87	I think we would put stop putting the in , we could get confused .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
3058.6	the soft X. rays or or the hard X. rays , you can point to the red and the 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[X., X.]
3132.13	Let's 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
3160.88	Although it does apply to the telescope .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	apply	[]	[]	[]
3166.13	Let's keep it in .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
3177.66	Let's start at the beginning .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
3309.75	Inseparate .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	Inseparate	[]	[]	[]
3387.38	List the wrong wrong colour for a few things .	EN2006a.B.words.xml	List	[]	[]	[]
43.32	You can call me Abbie .	ES2011a.A.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[Abbie]
124.27	And to do this , we have to um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing .	ES2011a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
137.29	We'll get to that .	ES2011a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
157.03	If we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal .	ES2011a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
508.46	Although uh I'll just put there .	ES2011a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
546.58	Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .	ES2011a.A.words.xml	hope	[]	[]	[]
643.51	Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .	ES2011a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
716.23	just like a magnet on the back of it and you could I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base .	ES2011a.A.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
747.22	Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm .	ES2011a.A.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
807.07	So what do we think this remote control should 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
846.74	So you could like um like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can the way you do it on your radio is that you uh what do you call it s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	programme	[]	[]	[]
942.98	I mean we'll have to see how much that would be .	ES2011a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
980.74	Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your like that's another 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	clip	[]	[]	[]
999.35	We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into .	ES2011a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1005.45	Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes .	ES2011a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1020.3	Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I.D. , yeah um is going to be looking more into the working design .	ES2011a.A.words.xml	stand	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer, I.D.]
276.47	Let's try this .	TS3010a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
533.85	So now yeah , now you can write another paper if you can 	IN1002.D.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
773.65	So forget about C.T.S. , at least now I think because it's again 	IN1002.D.words.xml	forget	[]	[]	[C.T.S.]
812.25	Yeah , the we can wait at least one or two weeks for this , because it's 	IN1002.D.words.xml	wait	[two weeks]	[]	[]
828.42	So maybe we can concentrate work especially on numbers now and then we can go to C.T.S. .	IN1002.D.words.xml	concentrate	[]	[C.T.S.]	[]
882.32	Yeah , that you can del 	IN1002.D.words.xml	del	[]	[]	[]
1039.19	Yeah , so at least we have wave files , so now we can generate anything in the P.L.P.s or so at least 	IN1002.D.words.xml	generate	[]	[]	[]
1210.4	It will ri 	IN1002.D.words.xml	ri	[]	[]	[]
1248.37	Uh it will have measures like 	IN1002.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1488.23	Maybe at least they will give some number others , like they can .	IN1002.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1515.59	Yeah , at least they they will know m beforehand I think uh .	IN1002.D.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1741.84	At least now he can know a full system setup from 	IN1002.D.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1900.97	So then again I will pass through full network .	IN1002.D.words.xml	pass	[]	[]	[]
1903.93	Then I can generate triphone gammas .	IN1002.D.words.xml	generate	[]	[]	[gammas]
1967.31	Uh so if you want a copy again , you'll have 	IN1002.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2029.72	Yeah , if they can decode at least Hemant's P. files then Hemant can 	IN1002.D.words.xml	decode	[]	[]	[Hemant, P., Hemant]
2106.4	No , it's the university is maybe it's really big , so they can afford for 	IN1002.D.words.xml	afford	[]	[]	[]
2183.56	So at least if we can recover we we can read some of his stuff or something .	IN1002.D.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
2194.24	Look for any features or anything are there .	IN1002.D.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
149.95	Meet 	IN1012.C.words.xml	Meet	[]	[]	[]
397.57	Yeah , that was the right choice , but to take something which which was uh direct , in quotes .	IN1012.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
437.58	Let's go on , this was just a 	IN1012.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
612.35	Yeah , computationally e expensive , but 	IN1012.C.words.xml	e	[]	[]	[]
1459.92	So so it n uh it might be bad for then for the back end , it might screw up the the t speech rate or normaliser .	IN1012.C.words.xml	screw	[]	[]	[]
1663.93	Well there should be after each conference there should be something like ten people should sit down , read the papers , and then rank them .	IN1012.C.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
1673.46	You know , a all the all the all the similar papers within one session say sp uh focus to this topic , and say this is the best , this works slightly worse than this one , and throw away what is not that good and and th the first three three papers which are the best shou should be implemented and used from from that time onwards , like forget the all the M.F.C.C.s , because it's too old , and then start building the story on the new stuff and not 'cause it's 	IN1012.C.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[M.F.C.C.s]
2319.38	Okay , so we can hope that Nokia will be using tandem tandem P.L.P.s .	IN1012.C.words.xml	hope	[]	[]	[Nokia]
2422.35	It's like a it's like a NASA , you know , they use four , eight four , eight , six , machines to to to to put two n uh space ships , because it's it's known to work perfectly well or Pentium , not any P. four or whatever , because it's safe , it has been working for twenty years , and then only it safe to put well not twenty but it's always yeah yeah , of course .	IN1012.C.words.xml	put	[four , eight, twenty years]	[Pentium]	[NASA, P.]
2539.58	You can look at the video and play it uh .	IN1012.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2829.93	Okay , I'm I'm fine with this , but I can make it run on my machine .	IN1012.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2962.33	Mm well I can prepare s sorry .	IN1012.C.words.xml	prepare	[]	[]	[]
571.74	It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons .	ES2002a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
25.06	You should put the laptop uh right into the square .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
44.94	So Do you want to open it as read-only .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
76.23	Um I will li list the agenda for today .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	list	[today]	[]	[li]
163.32	Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
170.86	Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
213.0	Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
223.39	The market , we should have a look at the market .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
238.76	Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the progressions , yes .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
262.54	Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific uh specification of that .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
293.39	How exactly does it work in the technical sense .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
297.73	Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
302.44	So we'll kop it keep it with the functional design .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	kop	[]	[]	[]
305.89	Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
313.07	Um as you see now I can give a presentation .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
321.61	You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
328.7	to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
348.66	yeah , I will show that now .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
352.53	you can draw on the board using this pen .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
385.86	you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	insert	[]	[]	[]
412.85	Just use this one uh during the day .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
416.34	Um you can use the eraser to 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
420.28	make something go away .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
437.76	Um you can choose the format , um sorry .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
444.18	Let me see .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
462.68	Current colour , you can choose another colour .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
470.77	black , and you c I can choose the line width .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
480.76	Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
494.59	Um as a little training um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[Ruud]
684.81	Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
697.74	Um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
717.68	Um we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
976.07	I'll go back to my own presentation .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
986.77	Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1261.62	Uh I'll write down glow in the dark .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1429.76	maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or yeah .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	light	[]	[]	[]
1468.08	so we will go back to our own uh work .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1486.39	See you in thirty minutes .	TS3011a.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
59.41	If you control click an utterance , it will play where it should be in the file .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
89.78	We should probably set those sizes 'cause that's such an easy thing to do .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[]
196.77	You can also control click on the dialogue acts and it will play that section of the file as well .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[]
264.87	Oh no , actually yeah , you can change it for in the summary when the summary gets called in program manager , you can do it .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
317.95	Yeah , try the summaries constructor .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
322.4	Well it reads them into separate arrays and then you can just change a flag to select one i which one it gives back .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
344.33	Yeah , I should make a new constructor that lets you set the flag .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
543.88	Okay , so I'll need to do some changes to program manager to be able to handle um changing results .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
568.12	Take and make them in a hash map or something .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
650.15	It'd probably be , yeah , best to make a copy of it .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
859.31	But we'll just create like hard segments at the start and end of each meeting .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
877.89	So other than , yeah , other than well we'll just create a hard boundary in between each one so you can see the thing .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
968.8	Yeah , it will still appear continuous on the display .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	appear	[]	[]	[]
1123.58	Yeah , in fact if someone could create a file with the speaker I.D.s and speaker names .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[speaker, I.D.s]
1172.87	But yeah , all the you can get all the utterances .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1215.82	Like we'll basi Yeah .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	basi	[]	[]	[]
1217.51	We'll get something to print out their locations .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1219.77	So we'll arrange it in a nice little order .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	arrange	[]	[]	[]
1245.26	Uh we should try running that thing again , see what it does now .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1258.56	Oh j so I can print obscene messages in the background to um standard output .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	print	[]	[]	[]
1316.7	Uh no , we'd have to look in their code and see what it actually does .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1351.37	Uh it should do , but you've probably gone past the end of the file .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1401.18	If we could do something like that that displays like a five line summary when you you're about to open the file or something like that .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1416.91	It could probably do it dynamically .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1420.6	Yeah , it'd look pretty and I'm not convinced you'd get any kind of good quality summary out of it in only five lines .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1468.9	'Cause what would be quite cool is if on this search result , you could give it each one a tool tip that had the context .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1494.76	But yeah , if we can get the tool tip , we should use it though .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1887.07	See how far I get anyway .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1914.7	Well you can easy add a command line parameter .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1930.93	It may even return a file directly .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	return	[]	[]	[]
1950.87	To set the par .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[]
1983.51	Oh yeah , that did happen once before .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	happen	[]	[]	[]
2180.43	Well you could you could choose whatever you wanted .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
2202.0	You might want to display all meetings that had a particular phrase mention , say .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2214.95	Whereas the da if you do it in the data manager , you can control any logic like that programmatically rather than doing it by hand and setting it in stone for all time .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[]
2372.31	We well we'd want to use F. zero when it's present .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[F.]
2427.55	You could use um red green and blue to display up to three .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2499.66	Or you could just split it into two blocks , I suppose , for now .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	split	[]	[]	[]
2607.42	So just keep yeah , just enumerate up for the next number .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
2752.03	Or just so you can configure the the location of all the files as an option .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	configure	[]	[]	[]
2756.83	But when it starts up it should just read them from the default place .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
2784.4	I mean obviously you it'd have to pick which one to synch the clock to .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2830.83	And then yeah , I could easily make it throw out three different dialogue acts .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2839.48	No , I'd just have two of them not synched up because it's just for evaluating the data .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2885.27	No , hold on , you it wouldn't need three internal time scales , 'cause only one's synched to the clock or it c and the others are all absolute real time , aren't they .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
3006.38	Mine , I'll need to make a minor addition to the data manager and the summariser .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
3080.47	We could just make that rate be something completely different , just disconnect it from whatever it's doing , and then have that set the length of the summary or something like that .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
3135.18	Yeah , I mean just disconnect it from whatever it sends the media player and connect it up to our summarisers .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	disconnect	[]	[]	[]
3144.13	'Cause like we could make that not even have like a a real sort of meaning , just put like max and min .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
3153.8	And the user can just like set it in-between wherever they want the uh without actually telling them what it actually means if you see what I mean .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[]
3176.81	We should certainly take away the labels that say minus four times as well .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
3272.81	It'd make more sense for us to divide up spend a couple of hours dividing up tasks and then do them separately .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
3317.64	And like when I go home I'll spend like the same amount of time and get loads done if you see what I mean .	EN2001d.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
103.99	fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
137.96	And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
151.7	And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	perform	[]	[]	[]
162.57	'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[Kay]
203.16	Save it in the project documents .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
394.27	Do you want me to run it or you wanna Okay .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[wanna]
469.05	Okay , what do you m Oh , I'm sorry .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	m	[]	[]	[]
471.67	What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
679.56	We could definitely include that if we wanted to .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
899.99	Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
938.74	We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's um wrap up this one , and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
953.59	Wait , come back .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
1053.74	What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	definitive	[]	[]	[]
1190.47	And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1196.92	So we said it needs to send messages to the T.V. , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1205.39	So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1310.37	Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1313.03	So that would include battery source 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
1350.93	You could um we could hook it up .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	hook	[]	[]	[]
1402.89	If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1408.98	then it could beep .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	beep	[]	[]	[]
1454.88	And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	remember	[this day]	[]	[]
1472.94	get your own remote , or digital cable .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1511.6	We could just have the logo in yellow , or maybe a yellow light for the keys .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1544.36	So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	channel	[]	[]	[]
1562.72	Um can we go back to I'm gonna look really quickly back at those 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1690.37	get out of here .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1693.43	Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next .	ES2010b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
146.87	The show must go on .	IN1014.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
654.42	Well as far as I as far as I know , I mean they do of course they can do of course slide detection .	IN1014.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
673.67	So with in uh in uh all the cases what I've seen , in all the cases I've seen I mean they s assume that at least you have like a P.D.F. version of the document or what .	IN1014.A.words.xml	assume	[]	[]	[P.D.F.]
761.19	I mean slide transition we would use slide uh need to do it slide transition .	IN1014.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
900.26	To capture the slide .	IN1014.A.words.xml	capture	[]	[]	[]
922.64	So we can tape snapshots .	IN1014.A.words.xml	tape	[]	[]	[]
924.74	So basically it might be interesting to have still um uh the s uh the slide stream so that for instance if we detect there is a new video that is displayed also on , to some extent we could just cut this videos to keep it and to be able to replay it uh later on and so on .	IN1014.A.words.xml	cut	[]	[]	[]
1002.75	And it especially because this would solve some of the issues regarding I mean like the possibility of d of displaying videos after from from what we record .	IN1014.A.words.xml	solve	[]	[]	[]
1474.2	I mean in the signal you can extract the time .	IN1014.A.words.xml	extract	[]	[]	[]
1492.17	So you can you can do it .	IN1014.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1503.8	Uh so you have you have some problems then , yeah .	IN1014.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2937.6	So what kind of solution , as Alexandre mentions , i do we need to take somebody , do we want to do we need to take some intern to work on this , uh and so on and so on .	IN1014.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[Alexandre]
2947.05	Do we take to have uh somebody uh for contract , even if it's not an intern but take somebody for six months to work on this .	IN1014.A.words.xml	take	[six months]	[]	[]
3387.77	So still we would be able to start doing some recordings and maybe uh doing even the automatic alignment , or at least we would have an idea about , 	IN1014.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3398.53	Uh do do because it's not like with microphone arrays where you would need micro-second alignments , of course .	IN1014.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
143.33	Yeah , at least you can write on the p 	IN1013.B.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
353.56	Because use linear phase or 	IN1013.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
607.69	Or like apply more 	IN1013.B.words.xml	apply	[]	[]	[]
684.74	You can do the L.P. analysis on each sub-band , yeah .	IN1013.B.words.xml	do	[]	[L.P.]	[]
1445.39	Like yeah , maybe you can try to reduce .	IN1013.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1583.94	So again you may end up some .	IN1013.B.words.xml	end	[]	[]	[]
1654.54	So m maybe it may help you , but it yeah .	IN1013.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
1881.36	Yeah , again give the phase .	IN1013.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2606.8	Yeah , it's really but uh how much you can get the compress these like what you're telling is you can do all these tricks like .	IN1013.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2650.45	Yeah , maybe you can look at dates from uh you know east of uh east uh yeah , East Anglia .	IN1013.B.words.xml	look	[]	[East Anglia]	[east]
2667.16	I yeah , it's yeah , I can forward you that .	IN1013.B.words.xml	forward	[]	[]	[]
2706.01	And then construct that .	IN1013.B.words.xml	construct	[]	[]	[]
571.27	Oh what I could do is um work um further with um what I've got now and then just when I have my um um yeah , the final formula ready , I could uh t apply to the new stuff .	EN2001e.C.words.xml	apply	[]	[]	[]
2747.15	So I could just extract the highest ones for each segment .	EN2001e.C.words.xml	extract	[]	[]	[]
2767.41	I could do both .	EN2001e.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
3324.76	At least their names , and if we have their names then we can get their email .	EN2001e.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
276.76	I'll go .	ES2010a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
470.11	So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals .	ES2010a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
773.58	Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that you know that would , that would really work .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
827.08	So I think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1122.17	Okay , I'll take my file down so you can bring it up .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1172.68	And show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
1216.44	We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's nice .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1295.52	And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1371.5	Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	do	[today]	[]	[]
1416.07	Go ahead .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1474.8	Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
1514.79	Okay you're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1601.56	Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	forbid	[]	[]	[heaven]
1687.75	So that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	eliminate	[]	[]	[]
1695.98	And um then maybe we can do something with the um 	IS1009d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1705.35	Maybe we can put that all on one button .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1709.18	Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	consolidate	[]	[]	[]
1918.56	It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace .	IS1009d.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
4903.23	So um it would be good to um t right now I'm doing this , um looking at the data and trying to see if I can do the meeting action segmentation first and the scheme , and then do topic segmentation again to see if the boundary actually coincide with each other .	EN2005a.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
4919.88	Yeah , if if that that do , then maybe we can talk again whether um i it it make sense .	EN2005a.C.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
45.81	I'll make funny drawings .	EN2002b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
266.75	I'll uh look at it like when my usual working hours are like from twelve o'clock till three o'clock or something , so if you can work on it that and then like No , actually not .	EN2002b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
307.64	Yeah , do what you wanna do with it first , and then I'll will look at Yeah , uh yeah .	EN2002b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
314.18	And I'll send it out to you again tomorrow or whatever .	EN2002b.A.words.xml	send	[tomorrow]	[]	[]
331.01	Probably wanna think about if we wanna change our goals and stuff .	EN2002b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[wanna]
679.62	But yeah but I'll work on it .	EN2002b.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
741.39	So now I could just put it in some 	EN2002b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
758.83	I'll take a look at that .	EN2002b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1736.6	And correct back any he like things that I thought was wrong in English or whatever .	EN2002b.A.words.xml	correct	[]	[]	[English]
204.48	Do you want the mouse , or do you want me to 	IS1008b.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
744.66	S 'scuse me for one sec .	IS1008b.C.words.xml	scuse	[]	[]	[sec]
1356.89	Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work .	IS1008b.C.words.xml	feed	[]	[]	[Ed, Christine]
1364.52	Um and then what the remote control should look like , obviously , once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are .	IS1008b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1454.54	And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons .	IS1008b.C.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
1462.02	So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , sorry , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple .	IS1008b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1600.15	Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include , 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table , but 	IS1008b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
105.0	So shall I go to sorry .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
288.04	So that will be the safe , so p any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	p	[]	[]	[]
305.91	Yeah , but uh uh my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
447.2	So I'll come back to the 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
476.39	So here you can uh look like uh the energy and uh dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
621.5	This we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
660.19	But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that uh I will look after .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
679.72	I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
1011.75	It will uh come back in two weeks , okay , it will be ready in two weeks .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	come	[two weeks, two weeks]	[]	[]
1034.39	So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	take	[a minimum two weeks, four weeks]	[]	[]
1054.21	So we'll do it in the other place , and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	do	[more than four weeks]	[]	[]
1064.03	Okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , then uh it's approve from uh the technical team and uh your team , okay , uh from the management , then we can launch in the market .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1111.45	Let's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1123.32	So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can uh go for the 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	introduce	[]	[]	[]
1181.79	Yeah , but uh see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like uh you can eat uh you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli , okay , so i it's a depends on the individual taste , you know , so we have we have to balance somewhere .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	eat	[]	[]	[]
1308.23	Yes , the that of course uh I will convince the management to do that , okay .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	convince	[]	[]	[]
1396.42	Okay , so then uh let's come to the closing and uh are the costs within the budget and uh is the product evaluated , okay , so that will uh come soon .	IS1008d.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
82.29	Well make the point , yeah .	IN1001.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
85.22	Make the status about the shot detection .	IN1001.A.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
89.64	To so you have applied the shot detector to some of the CINETIS video , or at least one , and uh so we can basically maybe just comment on on this , maybe quickly remind what the shot detector is how the shot detector is working , basically .	IN1001.A.words.xml	comment	[]	[]	[CINETIS]
432.43	So it's it's scrambled , so you can scramble the image and you get the same histogram .	IN1001.A.words.xml	scramble	[]	[]	[]
505.64	And uh so if you take uh these two with the with the Bhattacharya uh then of course you should just do a threshold .	IN1001.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Bhattacharya]
647.4	But then after suddenly if you go from one frame and you try to match all the points here with like a translation , plus the zoom plus maybe some rotation , you c you can find anything well , right , so basically you would see that the number of points maybe only ten percent of the points you can match well , so it's easy to detect .	IN1001.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
664.35	And uh after you can see that indeed because it's a long shot and it's almost like a flat plane , you can do a very good registration through the number of points .	IN1001.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
677.8	Uh and here you basically here with a histogram uh you can see it very flat , but of course you should go from this histogram to this which is essentially green .	IN1001.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
710.3	Just to explain uh how 	IN1001.A.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
848.18	Um but uh still uh in some of the v these videos for instance even if we gon go now if we want to , but now for the kayak case , I don't know .	IN1001.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
893.05	Yeah , I can bring my laptop if necessary , yeah , yeah .	IN1001.A.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
895.75	I'll I'll bring it , okay , so it's it's done .	IN1001.A.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
952.51	Yeah , and then he's doing quite a fast transition from these to another one , and I was wondering whether so if you well though of course it's true that it's mainly water , so maybe the colour is indeed uh quite but you know , as a kayak is entering quite fast , I mean you can have quite maybe good distance .	IN1001.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1006.66	Ah , to regenerate an A.V.I. file , okay , yeah , yeah .	IN1001.A.words.xml	regenerate	[]	[]	[]
1189.92	Well sometimes it's very difficult , so focus , usually there is no problem , people say this is a cut , this is not a cut , but like for dissolve even sometimes , you know , people may it's people may have some trouble I mean this is a dissolve this is not this should this should be labelled as a transition or not .	IN1001.A.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
1206.71	Some people will say yeah , but it's part of the thing , or uh for instance in like in um also in uh , come on , uh advertising usually .	IN1001.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1260.6	Maybe after they have this and they may say okay , just by looking at least the summary , so maybe for the summary we could do better uh key frame extraction for instance , but by just looking at the key frames and so on they may say okay , from this shot to this shot we apply like uh specific um colour enhancement algorithm or restoration algorithm or uh to improve uh the brightness and something like this right .	IN1001.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[algorithm, algorithm]
1301.27	Well , maybe after I mean they would sh okay , uh they would go directly and say select the shots from here to here , and they would say you apply this algorithm , yeah .	IN1001.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[algorithm]
1313.41	So of course we could try to make scene clustering and so on , but I'm not even sure that this is necessary for them at this point , because uh if they have a six minute movie , if they have thirty shots , for them it might be easier to look at from here to here I apply this , and they can do it quite quickly .	IN1001.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1381.34	So do you have uh more question or uh do you have a 	IN1001.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1446.3	I mean where I mean if second select from shot one to seven , uh this is a same seg they may do the grouping by themselves quite by looking at this it may take w w less one one minutes .	IN1001.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[shot]
1468.67	Uh because after it depends , I mean if you give only one key frame per shot , after I mean it's one hundred seventy images , it's quite fast , right , and so I think and the hierarchical thing is good , because still you can check if you have some ambiguities you are not sure , you could 	IN1001.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
1508.24	I I hope uh that uh if it's a big success uh they will ask IDIAP to to provide something like this of course with some money or at least to pay a student or somebody for doing it , but uh yeah , of course this was ultimately I think one way of uh if you could provide like chapters or something like this , indeed you could provide like the A.V.I. to the clients , and he may ask for special services or uh and even to just to watch the movie , to have direct access to different parts and so on .	IN1001.A.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[IDIAP]
1554.25	Yeah , yeah , he may want to organi yeah , yeah .	IN1001.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1556.82	Otherwise , I mean this but of but of course it might be easy to do a very simple software , which would allow the user to select just the shots and give names , and after it would generate automatically some index and uh as a I suppose the client might be interested in such a such a things if he could uh generate automatically on the D.V.D. .	IN1001.A.words.xml	allow	[]	[]	[]
1579.05	But for and you could imagine that before sending in the D.V.D. , you could allow him to l to watch this type of interface , and he would be able to do the selection , say this is this , this is this , this is this , this is this , and when he would receive the D.V.D. , he would indeed uh get already the chapters that he decided to put there .	IN1001.A.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1790.61	Yeah , normally it could it could go faster .	IN1001.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1979.24	You can do the get frame .	IN1001.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2318.79	Yeah , but it may happen that uh for ninety fra ninety percent of the frame it's different , so you see it fine , but suddenly you have one other frame , they don't know what it is and where it comes from .	IN1001.A.words.xml	happen	[]	[]	[]
2364.31	The first time , yeah , but after it's it take okay .	IN1001.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2562.43	Okay , to do this .	IN1001.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2596.49	No , because I was thinking if it's there , I mean we could use it uh uh we could uh you see but uh yeah .	IN1001.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2616.05	Fro from outside we can view them .	IN1001.A.words.xml	view	[]	[]	[]
3052.43	Ho how do you generate the Real Media , yeah .	IN1001.A.words.xml	generate	[]	[]	[Ho, Media]
3239.22	Yeah , but I think I think is it's too it's going very be very to be very good for them to visualise how you can organise things and maybe what they can do , how they and so this is important .	IN1001.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
138.1	Repeat it yeah .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	Repeat	[]	[]	[]
178.73	Uh we'll begin uh with the front .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	begin	[]	[]	[]
196.93	Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
331.31	You can make uh suggestions uh if you want .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
335.56	Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk and then you can add suggestions .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	finish	[]	[]	[]
395.32	And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	record	[]	[]	[]
409.67	Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , mean uh the the the the 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
467.14	Well any case , we'll discuss it now .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
511.19	And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , so Well 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	grab	[]	[]	[]
575.19	Let it be .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
923.97	And you can also have front with uh with fruit on it .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1276.41	W But you can better , yeah , dump the L.C.D. screen then .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	dump	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1406.55	We have we have to uh fill 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1423.86	We we do want to reach 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1622.17	And i you can also bring your your your note block .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1643.33	Uh I mean you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper If you've If you've 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1862.88	Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1870.19	And then you can save it immediately .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1914.11	No we must save this thing , yeah .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
2032.01	Blame our accountants .	TS3009d.C.words.xml	Blame	[]	[]	[]
590.78	So , go on uh artist .	IS1006c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
682.33	Let's change millenniums .	IS1006c.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
932.54	Pink 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	Pink	[]	[]	[]
955.46	Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod .	IS1006c.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[iPod]
1115.48	S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow , I dunno , that might be expensive but 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	record	[]	[]	[]
1200.05	Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	have	[these days]	[]	[]
1206.68	to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone .	IS1006c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1225.89	We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired .	IS1006c.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1405.17	Think fruit and vegetable .	IS1006c.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1446.12	Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1458.13	more uh uh look natural somehow .	IS1006c.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1671.86	Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend .	IS1006c.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1748.01	Maybe you could explore the two option .	IS1006c.D.words.xml	explore	[]	[]	[]
1830.62	You can paint it afterward .	IS1006c.D.words.xml	paint	[]	[]	[]
1840.22	You will do it .	IS1006c.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
511.74	I think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , but you can't just use 	IS1008c.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
597.5	So , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , but 	IS1008c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
750.93	You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T.V. off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons .	IS1008c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
777.8	And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish 	IS1008c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
786.82	And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T.V. and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control .	IS1008c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
805.68	Um , so again you can have a little L.C.D. light somewhere , the flip 	IS1008c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
817.41	So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design , which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it .	IS1008c.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
827.75	Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different .	IS1008c.B.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
854.25	As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences .	IS1008c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
895.14	So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines .	IS1008c.B.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
1073.66	Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and yeah .	IS1008c.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1136.53	But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote .	IS1008c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
546.34	Well do we w like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	w	[]	[]	[]
687.85	Okay , well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
704.54	rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	rank	[]	[]	[]
711.59	So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
727.99	So we can do this one first .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
753.65	Okay , well give it a number , sorry .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
802.66	Well there's some other ones , I will address that , yeah .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	address	[]	[]	[]
843.89	I'll give it a three .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
890.55	I'll give it a two .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
991.1	Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
1068.64	So I'll give it a two .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1194.8	It's hot , I mean it's a mango , come on .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1222.56	And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
1233.76	Just that it would se serve our audience .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	serve	[]	[]	[]
1270.7	And so we're gonna do that , so it will address it , fine .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	address	[]	[]	[]
1415.52	Oh wait .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1469.61	Oh wait , so maybe .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1814.96	I would break it .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	break	[]	[]	[]
1816.37	I would break it .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	break	[]	[]	[]
1867.67	Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , its all timed .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1906.58	Oh here you can you can view .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	view	[]	[]	[]
1915.43	Hold on .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	Hold	[]	[]	[]
2019.79	Get crazy .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	Get	[]	[]	[]
2030.88	like write up them here , 'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
2291.06	You'll lose 'em in your pocket , like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , there's always ways to lose things .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
2384.21	That really could get up and walk away .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2497.43	You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2505.46	'Cause I was like , it could go around the outside .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2552.71	I will I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , it's kind of an they were so not backed up , it would just be a sentence like we did a survey , this is what people said .	ES2008d.D.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
141.51	I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
173.89	Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
294.36	So we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
405.92	Yeah , we should change that 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
962.29	So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1187.15	Move on .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	Move	[]	[]	[]
1264.37	You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L.C.D. is .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1413.43	Do you know the new uh 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1660.44	You can buy a different kind of of of machine , but it's the same thing , but with another front .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1697.81	You can always take another pick .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1757.39	But we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
1833.25	You can take the SMARTboard .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1855.5	Have fun .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
1892.26	Round 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	Round	[]	[]	[]
1962.46	Let's start the design 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2030.17	Yeah , but you can scratch it off or something .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	scratch	[]	[]	[]
2182.61	Yeah , you can make it go 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2317.89	And it will sell .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
2388.37	Recalibrate it .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	Recalibrate	[]	[]	[]
2453.03	Have fun lads .	TS3009c.D.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
142.58	Can you use double-click or 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
231.19	But well , we we can have both , but whatever .	EN2002a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
657.56	So maybe you can just like choose the s same window for transcription and summary .	EN2002a.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
697.23	Yeah , uh change the contents of the same window , like from transcription to summary .	EN2002a.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
799.97	Like full meeting , meeting without disfluencies , and summarise .	EN2002a.B.words.xml	summarise	[]	[]	[]
949.81	Say that again , O. four .	EN2002a.B.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[O.]
994.49	I could tell you what I done in S.P. two .	EN2002a.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[S.P.]	[]
1034.73	I uh can have a look th at it .	EN2002a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1167.47	Or what do we need .	EN2002a.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1702.66	See .	EN2002a.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1759.99	Maybe you should make it exist then .	EN2002a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1923.42	We can go look we can look at now , afterwards .	EN2002a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2042.24	Yeah , th we will probably have it , yeah yeah .	EN2002a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2069.59	um the same things as in the comments , if I could read it .	EN2002a.B.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
209.3	See this .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
262.59	You can add your buttons .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
274.55	And so , we have buttons and using L.C.D. , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L.C.D. , and then do on and off .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[L.C.D., L.C.D.]
286.98	Then you ha you'll have volume control .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
289.48	So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
314.94	And it can also do the action .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
326.83	Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[Bobby]
336.87	Yeah , hi , and then you can use it .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
345.89	Mainly strawberry .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	strawberry	[]	[]	[]
347.16	So , you can have And then you can see the look L.C.D. and all the switches .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
363.04	We will send , we want to 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
382.05	You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
390.22	And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
416.54	Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or s 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	configure	[]	[]	[]
424.8	And you can have many colours on weekends .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
446.72	So , after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	propose	[]	[]	[]
483.12	Then we can discuss We can 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
488.39	Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
656.92	We can give at least five or six , seven .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
721.12	Yeah , we can easily plug it .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	plug	[]	[]	[]
759.25	Yeah , and you can do on L.C.D. using these going to scrolling all the option .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
795.07	You can select .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
845.21	Um , see in L.C.D. , like you will have blocks and you select which one .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
879.16	We will s We use titanium .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	s	[]	[]	[]
973.95	So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1000.12	Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[]
1319.96	Then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1323.5	And it will activate Um , plus , yeah , it's price is really 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	activate	[]	[]	[]
1459.27	Yeah , just remo 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	remo	[]	[]	[]
1515.0	So now on , we can increase our Still you have two more .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
1519.3	Maybe we can use it for our party .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1534.42	No , but point five point three .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
1586.3	And we can discuss all these things in our party .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1798.66	Uh , ye Will go to Italian restaurant , or 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[ye]
1803.39	We can decide .	IS1006d.C.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
151.98	We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this .	IS1008a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
177.47	We'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together .	IS1008a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
355.49	This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
372.5	You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing .	IS1007d.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
464.5	Oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
475.28	W w I'll I'll come to that point later on .	IS1007d.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
540.08	Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more .	IS1007d.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
562.36	Yeah yeah , for example the L.C.D. , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah .	IS1007d.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
592.57	Uh yeah yeah you should present that .	IS1007d.B.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[]
710.1	Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder .	IS1007d.B.words.xml	replace	[]	[]	[]
794.71	Maybe we can improve more on the design but uh this is the 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	improve	[]	[]	[]
1170.51	As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help .	IS1007d.B.words.xml	hire	[]	[]	[]
1274.06	So maybe I can put six to seven .	IS1007d.B.words.xml	put	[six to seven]	[]	[]
1354.55	we'll give them the give them the L.C.D. , we give what the customer uh wants , right .	IS1007d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1543.49	To improve on the design .	IS1007d.B.words.xml	improve	[]	[]	[]
1617.33	So we might lose the customer because of this .	IS1007d.B.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
1625.57	Yes exa what do you think , I don't know .	IS1007d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1689.14	Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons .	IS1007d.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
16.76	Can you just remind me , I don't have to tick the no n okay thing until I finish writing , but it's only if I go back to it I tick okay again .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	remind	[]	[]	[]
42.5	So if I'm working o if I've done a page , I'm on the second page , I tick it so um I finish that page and I go back to this , I can just write and then not tick until I finish writing again .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
69.32	And you can go on both sides as well .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
107.48	And I'll do that 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
137.85	So we'll send one , but weren't men I mean we could mention the fact that we're inviting other people , but I think it will probably just uh I mean it probably won't matter too much to the other linguists that we're having other people there .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
148.89	We can mention it , but it's not gonna be too essential and uh we might actually just end up making them worry that , you know , they're gonna lose their place or whatever , because uh I don't know .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	mention	[]	[]	[]
162.69	But we do we do have to decide a priority thing , so that's something else we can look at um a little bit 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
185.08	I'll do that today or tomorrow .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	do	[today, tomorrow]	[]	[]
189.09	Um now Claire , that's the other thing , she can deal with the Psychology .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	deal	[]	[]	[Claire]
202.79	'Cause she'll know which email address to use and and everything else .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
209.72	if one of us could email Claire .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	email	[]	[]	[Claire]
231.56	we might need to just remind her of the dates in case she doesn't know , so she gets the dates right .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
333.83	Um so yeah , so if if we've s if I've C.C.ed the original one , then you can tell her that that can be the basis for 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
360.13	in a way we could send out that first call to them , just as part of the same email , because I think they're more likely to think it was relevant to them .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
479.16	And you can run two in a row , but probably not up to three .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[]
535.24	Oh , so just have an hour and a half in the morning .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
557.01	So I think that's about as much as we could do , to have an hour and a half , then have a coffee break , then have an hour and a half , then have lunch , hour and a half , coffee break , hour and a half .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
611.13	Well I could look 'cause I I've got that there's the list , isn't there , of post-graduates I maintain in in linguistics .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
759.65	Like how long will people want to mill around for looking at 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
802.02	And we could probably get quite a few in there , at least six anyway .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
904.3	I can imagine it would seem a bit random just have like a poster session and bes uh yeah , just have a p a poster session um 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[bes]
938.5	the first-years who've only just arrived would do a poster .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	do	[first-years]	[]	[]
960.38	I think there's thirty talks and and say six , ten posters , whatever we can manage to fit in the room .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	manage	[]	[]	[]
971.99	We could have it in B. nine , but there's things all over the wall .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[B.]
1032.84	And we can sort of base it around that .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	base	[]	[]	[]
1055.27	Um we could even say something like um you know , first-years might want to give a poster or something like that because I don't know , maybe that's a bad idea , but 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	want	[first-years]	[]	[]
1101.38	So I've uh Okay , so English language um we'll put on the main call , and I'll just I I'll just kinda market it as an linguistics and English language or something like that , I think .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1121.55	Yes , and Informatics , we could think about it as well .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[Informatics]
1254.17	In fact , even by inviting um people from um Informatics and from or maybe from Philosophy and things , it might bias it in a particular direction .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	bias	[]	[]	[Informatics, Philosophy]
1333.74	Or we can just , you know , t uh take whatever we get and pick the best between us , which is 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1374.23	Yeah , so what you want to say is anyone who wants to give a talk on logic or philosophy of language , um but put a warning that if it's logic , then there's a good chance that no one will understand , or not that many .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1440.6	And then between us we'll have to have another meeting and and I mean at the same time as we're sorting through all the other titles and and deciding um how to divide up the sessions .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1464.78	And the reason she gave me was something to do with uh taking out like a whole day or a whole afternoon would be quite difficult , but I think that balance against the fact that most people want to be able to say well look , I can have just this one day off , as opposed to when I'll need an hour over three da you know , an hour each day for three days .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	have	[three days]	[]	[]
1481.79	It you can end up having to take three afternoons or three mornings or whatever off .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	end	[]	[]	[]
1490.98	Uh I think a lot of the time Simon Kirby has already said to me that anyone any of his students he wants to be on the first day , on the Wednesday , right , and that's because I shifted it I basically had it on Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday to begin with , and then eve it moved down twice to Wednesday , Thursday , Friday .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	begin	[the first day, Wednesday, Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday, Wednesday , Thursday , Friday]	[]	[Simon, Kirby]
1533.75	Um presu presumably you want to be there .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	presu	[]	[]	[]
1539.58	And then we can put them in a block at one time .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1671.62	Might even have to come in in the evening .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1676.78	Like maybe just get the chairs organised or whatever .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1679.58	We might actually have to go into the rooms and get things ready .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1721.84	Well , hopefully most people will d either have something like PowerPoint or they'll just have uh P.D.F. slides or something .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	d	[]	[]	[PowerPoint, P.D.F.]
1731.11	Hopefully , no one will have anything too specialized .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1807.77	If we gave them the whole month , that'd give us hardly any time .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	give	[the whole month]	[]	[]
1818.36	So give them something like give them something like ten days or whatever to get the title in , and then give them a week on top of that to get the actual abstract done .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	give	[ten days, a week]	[]	[]
1918.97	So give them a w yeah , a week for the title , and then they would have about ten days from then to actually get the abstract in .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	give	[about ten days]	[]	[]
1947.92	That would be a week anyway , but you can give them ten days to you can give them ten days to get the title , or you can give them it depends which way around you wanna do it .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	give	[a week, ten days, ten days]	[]	[]
1955.05	So what's gonna take them longer actually to decide what they're gonna do and send the title , or is it gonna be on the basis of the title , do they want more time to write the abstract .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1982.94	And this presumably will apply across the board .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	apply	[]	[]	[]
2008.52	They can send it to P.G.C. at ling as long as we can get the Wh I'll tell you what I'll do then , I'll go and see Mike th today and and get the password and everything .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[P.G.C., Mike]
2040.89	'Cause you can send from any email address you like .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
2068.72	You may already know , but the thing is if you want to send this call for abstracts , you know , when you do the philosophy and and thingy one , then if you want to send from P.G.C. , then uh I mean you might already know , but you can go f if if you did it from web-mail , you can just create a new account for yourself and where it sa it actually has a send from address , and you can just put P.G.C. at ling dot and just do it that way .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[P.G.C., P.G.C.]
2106.87	I'll send it from P.G.C. , so if anyone replies , it would just go to that account and any of us can access it at any time .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[P.G.C.]
2113.39	Presumably , you can access from web-mail or , you know , or I. MAP or whatever .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	access	[]	[]	[I., MAP]
2122.43	Yeah , if you want to to create a web page and just copy my email into it or something , and anything else you might wanna do , and then later on we can put the uh the programme in .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2189.25	So we can with Melissa and we'll just send out an email .	EN2003a.A.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[Melissa]
572.01	Yeah , some beep or something like that , so that we can go 	IS1009a.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
581.48	Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is .	IS1009a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
281.74	I do know so .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
328.81	Look , if uh i i 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
474.63	Uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , I guess .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	access	[]	[]	[]
651.49	No , but if if like this , I'll I'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , I won't draw it really .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
676.23	Uh , wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom oh , right , help .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[]
681.76	Uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh in in the 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
845.27	I will be needing that image , so leave it please .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
853.47	Go away .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
871.83	I wanna have a colour over here , come on .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
885.87	Uh , what would you say , we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	forget	[]	[]	[]
983.62	I'll mark it .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[]
1051.48	Nay that that that's true , that's true .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	Nay	[]	[]	[]
1107.71	Well , uh forget that .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	forget	[]	[]	[]
1113.32	Go away .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1226.06	Come on .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
1235.73	Go away .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1330.49	Forget that .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	Forget	[]	[]	[]
1549.61	Alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
1931.34	We can make a plain docking station for two Euros .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Euros]
1942.63	Yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2034.14	Reanimate it .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	Reanimate	[]	[]	[]
2242.65	Well , we might want it , but 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2380.28	We can make a docking station for two thirty .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	make	[two thirty]	[]	[]
2386.57	We can make a docking station .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2451.31	You can sell for twenty seven and a half .	TS3008d.D.words.xml	sell	[twenty seven and a half]	[]	[]
69.97	from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given .	IS1009c.A.words.xml	market	[]	[]	[]
94.57	So we should address that .	IS1009c.A.words.xml	address	[]	[]	[]
210.26	Francino who is our um interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it , of course , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock .	IS1009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
240.93	And maybe have an anar alarm-clock .	IS1009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
314.19	Oh , come on , close already .	IS1009c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
984.52	Go away .	IS1009c.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1533.62	And uh so what do we think on the concept 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1679.51	Put uh k I guess uh for yeah .	IS1009c.A.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
1712.59	Uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the uh I.D. is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[I.D.]
1752.88	You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches .	IS1009c.A.words.xml	receive	[]	[]	[]
1759.54	Um if you have any questions , you know , you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach , I suppose .	IS1009c.A.words.xml	contact	[]	[]	[]
200.44	And then talk about how the annotation for information density and stuff should maybe be structured in a similar way .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
281.82	In some way like i in the end it'll result in one annotation .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	result	[]	[]	[]
313.9	See , that's what I was thinking .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
332.69	Does anyone know any good standards software displays X.M.L. , I'm not sure .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
354.23	I can probably just Emacs them .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	Emacs	[]	[]	[]
422.85	You know , wha wha each turn , so if we 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[]
501.11	Let's actually just see if maybe K. right .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[K.]
578.13	Oh wait , somebody s s somebody explain that slowly to me .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
658.67	Just see , can we have this files somewhere .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
673.17	Let me see if I have that words X.M.L. file .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
711.47	Sorry , I'm just I'm trying to arrange them , so that we have one above the other , so to make some sense of that .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
956.18	But you'd think that the easiest way and the way that how it's intended to be would be just , 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1008.74	So this whole information we would then store in this Ah , no , that I don't have access to because I didn't download like there's this one meta information file where it describes the structure of all the files and describes which um which attributes they bring in .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	store	[]	[]	[]
1030.23	And then we would create the file of that type , which we probably couldn't call it segment .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
1036.48	We probably might have to have a different word for it .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1049.0	In the existing segments file .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	file	[]	[]	[]
1170.16	So maybe if we g if we go ahead , do you think it would be possible for you to do an like something like segments or maybe just a copy of segment which has an attribute for for each segment , um but it is like with a with a value with a density value .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1286.71	This probably would be a lot easier would I really understand how they are handling the data internally , 'cause then we c then I could say oh , it's easy to just tie it in if you just have it time-stamped that just reference by words and stuff .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
1324.85	But every word does does the word picking , like does it always have the same information value in your thing i does it depend on its position like 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1472.63	If you if you already have you have in the right order all the words with a with a score to them , and you have a file which has each word and a time stamp .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1689.01	I can just like k k I can sit together with you for twenty minutes and just show you the entropy code that I wrote for my other project and it probably and we should work together because it's we used t we have to we'd use the same matrix as I'm using in my latent semantic analysis , you'd use to calculate entropy scores .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[]
1705.96	And then we'd have um a score which actually which would be the same for the word in each position .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1772.52	Least like expressive , and l contain less information .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	contain	[]	[]	[]
1784.02	You could imagine it to f like be in all in all the contexts .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1815.68	Now in this case , we would do it by per mee words per meeting .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[mee]
1884.34	The same word the word yesterday would be would have the same score all over the place .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	have	[yesterday]	[]	[]
1957.32	But what I'm really like because the entropical um calculation is so simple , maybe we should look into making that score just as a preliminary score that we have .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1981.67	I like there is some hope that probably having just sentences where there's lots of very specific words , if you mark them as being more interesting than the words which are only very general words , that they would get us somewhere .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2039.3	What do you mean every sequence of the same 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
2222.02	You know what , as a byproduct of my L.S.A. I'll provide um a vocabulary like sort of a dictionary which for each word gives an entropy score entropy score , which just tells you of how much information the presence of a word tells you about which topic it is .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[L.S.A.]
2261.64	And I'll just provide that , because that's just not much more work than just the usual thing .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[]
2294.64	It it used is each word completely unique , like sort of does it treat each word , each occurrence of word , as a completely unique event .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	treat	[]	[]	[]
2398.84	T I mean , let's just keep on talking meanwhile and I'll try to start that up .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2465.59	if we get it on a word by word basis whatever you do it'll probably appear in a word by word basis , and what you have on a sort of segment but not quite segment base .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	appear	[]	[]	[]
2565.22	we can go with the script and sort of go for each segment to the starting and end times and say okay , this is from our time segment f here to this time segment there .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2573.9	So we take the some of those and divide them by by the number or something , create the average and put it in as the value for the segment .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
2591.27	Tha that's that's a fiddling play in the end , but that problem we'll always have .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Tha]
2673.18	And then you would map your information onto individual words .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	map	[]	[]	[]
2694.04	'Kay , and and then we could have like some type of just point in the end where the one scores from the all the individual word cells get multiplied all with like for each utterance or whatever .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Kay]
2705.05	You have get all multiplied with the same value all the ones that are within that utterance .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2714.95	And then we'd have to go back again and then put that back into that segment mode here .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2763.47	And their segments do overlap .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	overlap	[]	[]	[]
2784.14	So you could on their granularity you could on their granularity create a score like for each for each of their segments .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
2796.46	Well I guess I mean for you , if you know for each word , if you find that out , then it has to be possible , because if we know sort of this is going from word to word or it this is going from time to time and then there has to be a way then for you say okay , this concerns these following words , and then just make make a simple mean over them .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2822.21	in the X.M.L. file you had , but if we do that in the software , then we can probably make ways of playing with it in the software and sort of l you know like adapting some sort of control , like playing around with look like it's playing with different weightings for that the utterance-based one versus the word-based one and sort of look at it dynamically .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
2860.62	Yeah , we could probably like make a uh um graphic display initially , at least for our experimenting .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2865.63	We'd just place them in different ways and then see how they interact with each other .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	place	[]	[]	[]
2875.35	So do you think y like both of you then can map something onto their segments , like just each of you provide one value , like double value or whatever , like one decimal value or whatever onto onto exactly their segments .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2934.41	'Kay , I might just change my order of in which I do things and like forget my latent semantic analysis stuff until the weekend and try to really make sense of the 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[Kay]
3017.84	And that we could load into a prototype and see what types of disp what ways of displaying this information are there .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
3201.68	So that would show you how much relative to how he sort of how he's performing generally in that meeting relative to that how he's in a specific segment .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
3222.55	Yeah , guess I've asked this question fifteen times now .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	guess	[]	[]	[]
3244.65	Oh they w they do exist .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	exist	[]	[]	[]
3268.88	See , as soon as as soon as I'm halfway through my L.S.A. like basically as soon as I have the the matrix built , if of the document by word stuff , it's very easy to then calculate for each word a score , and I can just give you those scores and you can do with them whatever you want .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	See	[]	[L.S.A.]	[]
3297.34	Yeah , I think Colin , Dave and me will actually work on on the Java stuff , and it and we'll just see whatever you whatever you supply us , we'll try to tie in and visualise in some way or another .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[Colin, Dave, Java]
3309.52	Um I'll ask Jonathan if we can postpone the meeting to one o'clock .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[Jonathan]
3315.97	So that would give us a chance of meeting in for an hour before that to discuss the questions that we had .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
3401.44	Sort of like if basically if we have something like this segments file , but for each of you like just have one attribute .	EN2001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
130.26	Just go to explorer .	IS1007b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
145.48	Open uh .	IS1007b.D.words.xml	Open	[]	[]	[]
369.92	Yeah to run th to make it run .	IS1007b.D.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[]
726.45	Oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then .	IS1007b.D.words.xml	assume	[]	[]	[]
825.29	just give it a name and we call him .	IS1007b.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
860.89	And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that 	IS1007b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
913.58	Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones .	IS1007b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
994.69	So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features .	IS1007b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
311.65	So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption .	ES2009d.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
761.17	I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that .	ES2009d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1077.1	W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again that we're 	ES2009d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1465.89	Oh yeah , still have 'em .	ES2009d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1722.22	Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning .	ES2009d.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
2032.4	Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years .	ES2009d.C.words.xml	Dude	[like eighteen years]	[]	[]
703.62	Receive .	IS1009b.B.words.xml	Receive	[]	[]	[]
1239.88	Now for that , uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T.V. and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T.V. .	IS1009b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
1283.88	So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the T.V. will automatically it will switch on at that particular time .	IS1009b.B.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1293.89	So he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel .	IS1009b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1359.89	And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P.M. then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote .	IS1009b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[P.M.]
1378.3	Yes , and as John Reece said the buttons can be , uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently .	IS1009b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[John, Reece]
1391.84	So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel .	IS1009b.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1461.51	Not , uh no uh like it can it can be used as a T.V. control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that .	IS1009b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1495.47	Yeah and then you can use a timer as well .	IS1009b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1736.96	No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .	IS1009b.B.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
99.28	Go ahead .	ES2009c.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
289.86	Choose it .	ES2009c.D.words.xml	Choose	[]	[]	[]
389.91	It's an option , uh but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand , it may help us decide for now .	ES2009c.D.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
1046.95	See if we can cut some corners .	ES2009c.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1051.73	Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .	ES2009c.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1213.24	But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model .	ES2009c.D.words.xml	tend	[]	[]	[]
1628.6	Take precedence , yeah .	ES2009c.D.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
1645.3	Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p 	ES2009c.D.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[iPod]
1852.95	Yeah , get in there .	ES2009c.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1683.96	You always could have a look at the time stamps and then take the ones that uh belong together to form an utterance .	EN2001a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2627.85	Yeah , I w I w I would need the raw text pretty soon because I have to find out um how I have to put the segments into bins .	EN2001a.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2739.89	Think they say um quite a lot of numbers and before that , uh um there's this number .	EN2001a.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
2935.89	Um no , I have to bin it up and so I will only have counts for each each bin or something .	EN2001a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2965.8	Yeah sure , you sure , we could do that , but I don't that makes sense .	EN2001a.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2978.15	If we need just frequencies , maybe we should just calculate them by using Perl or something .	EN2001a.C.words.xml	calculate	[]	[]	[Perl]
3493.64	Uh I can get all the raw text , but it has to be ordered still .	EN2001a.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
3575.35	Um we would have to look at that .	EN2001a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
4317.96	Print out .	EN2001a.C.words.xml	Print	[]	[]	[]
4358.74	Did you also order 	EN2001a.C.words.xml	order	[]	[]	[]
4871.04	No , how long you would have to program something .	EN2001a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
126.57	So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy .	IS1007c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
144.85	We also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control .	IS1007c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
178.15	we will put inside the the remote .	IS1007c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
207.38	Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so .	IS1007c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[mm]
317.29	You you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
348.1	Yeah and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy .	IS1007c.C.words.xml	accumulate	[]	[]	[]
381.83	And yeah and so can you go to the next slide please .	IS1007c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
951.46	To have a help button .	IS1007c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
957.74	On the T.V. screen the uh how to use your remote .	IS1007c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1540.18	Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find and when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1568.77	Put 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
1689.65	Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T.V. you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that .	IS1007c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1735.91	So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on .	IS1007c.C.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
329.94	So uh maybe to list down the things other than the what I've already taken from you .	IN1007.C.words.xml	list	[]	[]	[]
336.31	And also to discuss generally .	IN1007.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
470.68	But uh maybe I can take the interceptor from you and run it once on my to have it .	IN1007.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
488.17	So then I can can share what I ca have read and uh 	IN1007.C.words.xml	share	[]	[]	[]
501.9	So I'll use this .	IN1007.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
505.55	Let's do the feature extraction that we have already taken , then the back-end for that .	IN1007.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1016.09	Yeah , use maybe you can use the board for that , yeah .	IN1007.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1423.25	To fit the the 	IN1007.C.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
2169.81	But I can come to yeah .	IN1007.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
281.03	You should write y the name I think .	IS1001a.C.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
689.6	We should have s uh special bu button on the T.V. to make the remote control beeping .	IS1001a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
50.64	Well , I heard that there was a new uh component speech recognition component , which was pretty much up to standard , so we might use that I put that in my drawing , but again I didn't not have that much time .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
75.91	Let me just 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
344.52	I'll show that in my design .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
347.57	So we'll get back to that .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
382.89	Okay , I t I'd go for plastic because I have a couple of curves in my design .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
616.47	And then I also have a standard edition , which wi we can also choose to develop too .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[wi]
663.63	Get back .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	Get	[]	[]	[]
732.12	Well , they b they basically can have speech recognition .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
796.01	So you can you can hold it really comfortable , that's basically the idea .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
812.13	So just imagine it goes that way .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
838.96	So excuse me for the uh inconvenience here , but as you can see , the keys moved .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	excuse	[]	[]	[]
881.01	Well we can shift that .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	shift	[]	[]	[]
1155.54	But that will bring extra c expenses .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1202.76	And we could have one here .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1475.32	To create a kind of disco effect when you 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
1486.02	We can also use one light for 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1518.75	Speech recognition , I where did I imagine .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1522.4	I did that pretty much over here , so that you could use it like this 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1527.78	and speak to it .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
1712.32	We could put our logo there .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1787.48	Well , you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	shift	[]	[]	[]
1953.24	Or they can design their own cover .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
1955.66	We could set up a a marketing uh agreement .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[]
2026.61	'Cause you can talk to it like this .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
2282.03	Uh you could use it for the channels and for the volume .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2351.52	Yes , you can colour rubber , yeah .	TS3012c.B.words.xml	colour	[]	[]	[]
694.41	well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , 	ES2013a.C.words.xml	channel	[]	[]	[]
13.27	crack on .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	crack	[]	[]	[]
14.5	Okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
72.06	So we'll just crack on , um like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	crack	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
111.35	Yeah , okay well I'll just uh I'll load it up then .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
641.47	Um conventional battery would seem to make sense .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	seem	[]	[]	[]
838.75	That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[]
1099.07	File open .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	File	[]	[]	[]
1494.43	Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1733.49	Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function , and such .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1787.41	Okay , this just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1818.48	So for example , um I'll just start at the top , you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to , obviously .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
1945.76	Um so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out , uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which I suppose is quite similar .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2016.16	Think that's well within the normal bracket .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
2018.0	Um your idea of the U.S.B. would I think would largely depend on the cost .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[U.S.B.]
2023.42	U.S.B.'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[U.S.B.]
2037.11	That one might have to be based on 	ES2003c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2063.94	programming it to use your T.V. , you might hook it up to the P.C. .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	hook	[]	[P.C.]	[T.V.]
2132.94	It would make sense to .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2145.85	International would make sense .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[International]
2182.55	Yeah , I would s that would be my my feeling .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	s	[]	[]	[]
2250.33	See everybody in a half hour .	ES2003c.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
573.89	Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
633.22	But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	stand	[]	[]	[]
638.48	So make it just a different colour or different shape , so 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
736.75	just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
744.32	to find out .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
748.82	Of functions I could think of .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
815.97	So switch to channel six .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
859.42	Um well play , pause .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
909.49	Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
935.05	To just keep it simple and standard uh features .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
951.65	But you can have a button that says um 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
981.7	So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
1014.42	But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , so you have 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[]
1056.49	And later we can d uh do the design .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1072.15	So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1107.4	Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1282.21	Maybe integrate it in the design as well .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[]
1334.05	So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1594.11	'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1638.37	Yeah , if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1823.48	I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , to make it more like a mobile phone .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1926.29	Uh does your uh Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	lie	[]	[]	[]
2137.03	You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much .	TS3004b.B.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[]
154.94	So you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .	ES2011d.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
159.6	And it comes yeah , I can change the vegetable .	ES2011d.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
181.89	So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .	ES2011d.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
189.74	And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .	ES2011d.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
875.94	Wait a minute .	ES2011d.B.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
889.13	I'll just I'll just reverse them all .	ES2011d.B.words.xml	reverse	[]	[]	[]
933.15	Say two .	ES2011d.B.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
1273.24	We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits .	ES2011d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1383.96	Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape .	ES2011d.B.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1851.1	Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence .	ES2011d.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
273.26	Now where do I put the 	ES2003a.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1002.36	Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of 	ES2003a.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
432.39	I will beat the dolphin .	TS3012a.D.words.xml	beat	[]	[]	[]
103.42	Actually uh you can t perhaps just uh just 	IN1009.A.words.xml	t	[]	[]	[]
633.73	So uh we might add there a lot of uh features .	IN1009.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
740.63	Yes , also uh to to extract the context .	IN1009.A.words.xml	extract	[]	[]	[]
761.31	You mi you might want to add uh this kind of this is not in uh my project , but 	IN1009.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
794.53	And have a special events trigger if 	IN1009.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
891.06	Yes , um uh but in fact you have to sit in front of the microphone , and it's uh yeah , people one speak and people two and people three and you are just uh subtracting the the level that you you kept in the other microphones .	IN1009.A.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
1146.65	And you can code Java .	IN1009.A.words.xml	code	[]	[]	[Java]
1154.94	You can choose Matlab .	IN1009.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[Matlab]
1185.17	I will take yours .	IN1009.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
83.19	And I can start if you want .	ES2011b.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
92.74	Um , how do I put this I'll just put the cable in .	ES2011b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
142.19	Oh wait , um .	ES2011b.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
158.5	Oh , wait .	ES2011b.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
260.1	The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television .	ES2011b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1057.2	You can hear it's under the couch yeah .	ES2011b.D.words.xml	hear	[]	[]	[]
1067.52	So need the other buttons .	ES2011b.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1195.8	of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of 	ES2011b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1256.92	And then you can have um if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing 	ES2011b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1280.6	Yeah , click o actually click on to have 	ES2011b.D.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1341.76	Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up .	ES2011b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1449.16	find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that's another thing they complained about .	ES2011b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
317.75	I'll get it .	TS3010d.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
390.85	Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two .	TS3010d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
560.05	Oh , we'll wait outside .	TS3010d.C.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
605.24	Say two .	TS3010d.C.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
864.3	It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .	TS3010d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1306.67	Oh , wait wait wait .	TS3010d.C.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1336.51	Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television .	TS3010d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1415.27	But then the print on it will g um change it .	TS3010d.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1418.28	Make it uh 	TS3010d.C.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
128.39	Uh opening acquaintance , tool training , uh how to use the things here .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
166.73	And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	have	[the end of the day]	[]	[]
178.53	uh we should take some practice .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
197.65	And we can use this pen to perform .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
216.93	draw .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
218.21	Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[etcetera]
232.11	Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
237.44	Uh you should explain 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
241.96	And you should explain why you draw that particular animal .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
261.47	And use different colours etcetera .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
287.67	Yeah you can press the next button , which is uh yeah .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
292.29	I'll show you .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
330.7	Uh could you press the next uh 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
601.97	Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[Euros]
664.93	Okay so the um uh this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	produce	[]	[]	[industrati, Industrial, Designer]
677.97	Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	specify	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer]
686.35	And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert]
979.9	we can go ahead with what we have .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
983.39	I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	summarise	[]	[]	[]
989.52	Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
1042.49	And then I have to prepare uh I have to defend our design , so make it good .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1077.41	Uh do they want all those functions on that small 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1094.2	You can always add a few 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1155.33	We could just start with the assumption that's only for T.V. and video .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1159.78	And um reserve the possibility to add other features .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	reserve	[]	[]	[]
1200.58	Let's see what we got to do .	TS3006a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
57.44	Okay , carry on .	ES2013c.A.words.xml	carry	[]	[]	[]
77.8	Um and we should each have a presentation to make .	ES2013c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
102.16	Um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
179.33	Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point .	ES2013c.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
213.86	Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T.V. , but it still should meet those parameters .	ES2013c.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[T.V.]
220.53	Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held .	ES2013c.A.words.xml	enter	[]	[]	[]
234.55	Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for .	ES2013c.A.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[Sarah]
281.51	Go back .	ES2013c.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
326.17	Um , did you do your Hit 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
659.18	Well actually some households do have three and four T.V.s and they would have a remote for each one , so .	ES2013c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.s]
800.88	Okay , we'll move the 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
977.27	Remember , we only have forty minutes 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
1354.61	This time it should come up both .	ES2013c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1830.38	Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow .	ES2013c.A.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
1977.3	or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it .	ES2013c.A.words.xml	die	[]	[]	[]
2260.92	And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can .	ES2013c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2344.7	Go to it .	ES2013c.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
38.95	So , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[mm]
48.31	Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
59.08	So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
72.61	We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
108.75	We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T.V. .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	button	[]	[]	[T.V.]
131.09	So now uh we will have three presentations .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
157.29	So maybe we can start with uh industrial design .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
172.92	Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
263.27	Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	afford	[]	[]	[Euros]
338.71	Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	listen	[]	[]	[]
475.54	Well we will discuss that after maybe 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
910.56	Maybe pear yeah or something like that .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	pear	[]	[]	[]
915.67	We can discuss that uh .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
924.25	I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	banana	[]	[]	[]
1033.78	Maybe we can keep the banana .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1228.72	You can do both with both hands .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1270.85	I can do this movement , and for righty as well .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1329.22	we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1337.08	So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1343.27	And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[prodyuc]
1351.34	That is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
1374.39	to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer, User, Interface, Designer]
1392.95	you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	receive	[]	[]	[]
1425.52	See you .	IS1001c.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
906.81	So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys , um so it's good you went first , and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others .	ES2005b.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
951.43	And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort .	ES2005b.A.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
983.99	Well maybe you could have a 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1055.19	I figured , just put 'em all together .	ES2005b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1071.04	Give it one button 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	Give	[]	[]	[]
1084.53	Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1133.48	Yeah , yeah , we could do that too .	ES2005b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1154.31	Right , so so the unirs the user interface uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1285.25	Just push it .	ES2005b.A.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
1589.62	You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B.B.C. one and it goes to that channel .	ES2005b.A.words.xml	programme	[]	[]	[B.B.C.]
1643.87	Right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise .	ES2005b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1673.01	Right , and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television .	ES2005b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1688.72	If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it .	ES2005b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2182.68	We could go comp yeah .	ES2005b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2184.99	We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball .	ES2005b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2192.37	And there's no buttons at all , it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works .	ES2005b.A.words.xml	yell	[]	[]	[]
2197.93	And then ch children will love it .	ES2005b.A.words.xml	love	[]	[]	[]
142.79	They can switch later .	IB4002.A.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
1017.99	I mean , if there are reception hours , so somebody could move to the reading room , and have people 	IB4002.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
1169.55	So maybe you and Bruno should take this office .	IB4002.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[Bruno]
1424.03	suggestion , if possible , we could move me and Yalina to the office where Andrei and Nancy are now .	IB4002.A.words.xml	move	[]	[Yalina]	[Andrei, Nancy]
312.11	Otherwise we could have uh we could imagine to have a whole table of of uh s well , of L.E.D.s .	IN1008.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.E.D.s]
318.15	And then y you can really start to to some regions of the table .	IN1008.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
529.26	Yeah , I can just explain my project .	IN1008.B.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
568.13	So you just have another f computer more or less you can use , but you can use it with your your own mouse and keyboard .	IN1008.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
581.11	But uh in contrary to to having al another keyboard and mouse that only one person can use , now the different persons can use the the screen um at the same time with the with the mouse .	IN1008.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[al]
761.45	And then you can start to visualise these uh different situations .	IN1008.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
839.09	Uh afterwards uh one could imagine that you for example you can detect that someone is a bit angry or is uh yelling .	IN1008.B.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
847.71	And wi with different colours with uh with different colours on on table you could uh display this this uh give some feedback .	IN1008.B.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
949.03	Everything from um multi switch administration of uh audio and how you can uh analyse it , uh what information you can get out of speech and so on .	IN1008.B.words.xml	analyse	[]	[]	[multi, switch, administration]
1070.16	Give a lot of information how it is audio programming and so on works , cetera .	IN1008.B.words.xml	Give	[]	[]	[]
1387.1	Well actually , just to have the the ICSLA e uh possibly to to branch ICSLA .	IN1008.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[ICSLA, ICSLA]
2558.09	I'll show you this afterwards .	IN1008.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
3070.63	Well , otherwise it could also just rely on the frequency band separation and detect that way the different persons and th then you don't really know where around the table these .	IN1008.B.words.xml	rely	[]	[]	[]
3099.65	That way you can separate where where is the the voice loud with uh or the loudest .	IN1008.B.words.xml	separate	[]	[]	[]
739.53	'Cause it I think if we have an L.C.D. , it will also sell a lot better .	TS3010c.D.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
744.84	And that might uh bring back the costs uh 	TS3010c.D.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
899.92	That should feel have uh a spongy feeling .	TS3010c.D.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
903.71	And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it .	TS3010c.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
922.8	To get a feeling for this .	TS3010c.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
930.98	So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends .	TS3010c.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1067.09	Can make several uh concepts .	TS3010c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1525.51	Think we have we have now two buttons missing .	TS3010c.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1535.98	And um , the to to uh have to uh numbers 	TS3010c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2048.97	See you at the next meeting .	TS3010c.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
412.36	But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[al]
821.17	Put that on the button bottom .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
1052.27	So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[ma]
1074.15	We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1139.28	Just give five with them , just in a box .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1215.55	But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1259.92	They can choose .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1291.15	Maybe put some different ones in it .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1298.27	Just make it some different colours .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1475.08	Just skip it .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
1681.09	Maybe you can make it like this .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1688.91	So that you just um It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
1712.8	Okay , so we'd have this .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1752.99	Because you already have the volume here , so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1761.37	So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1902.64	Let's give five .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1924.43	So you could put it like that , okay .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1979.04	But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	round	[]	[]	[]
1986.23	Just round it up .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	round	[]	[]	[]
2244.38	Make it in in yellow or something .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
2303.1	Okay , so just finish it .	TS3004c.A.words.xml	finish	[]	[]	[]
2322.23	But you'd definitely need a 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
103.14	All of the windows open , you can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building .	IB4001.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
282.88	So what I'd propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics , and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals , as to exactly where to put people .	IB4001.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
325.46	So we should leave a space for that .	IB4001.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
349.09	sort of keep that in mind , I guess , when 	IB4001.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
542.77	Well , the third option is just completely mix everyone up , which some people say is better sort of for a group environment , so that you are not stuck only with the people who are working on your project .	IB4001.B.words.xml	mix	[]	[]	[]
622.82	make an appointment for it .	IB4001.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
624.02	You just kind of go to someone's office and go down for a coffee or whatever .	IB4001.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
826.79	So take away three spaces and you're down to your fifteen , and you're right , if we do have a stagieur , whoever , who comes in , then we have nowhere Well , we can put them in the reading room , but that kind of defeats the purpose .	IB4001.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
862.02	Or again find people who don't work the same hours .	IB4001.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
965.04	Yeah , we could do that .	IB4001.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1395.8	I think it's just a question of work conditions , like if you are a stagieur and you co only coming in for two months , then you can put up with it , but if you're there , you know , for the full year 	IB4001.B.words.xml	put	[two months, the full year]	[]	[]
1489.42	So wait , we face the old town we face the old town now , and we are facing 	IB4001.B.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1644.6	Excuse me .	IB4001.B.words.xml	Excuse	[]	[]	[]
1660.78	I'll put her in grey , I guess .	IB4001.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1712.93	We can keep some of the people together that are together now , but 	IB4001.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1732.71	And then once we have more concrete ideas we can come back and finish it , 'cause if we just sit here and discuss , it's gonna take a long time and we're gonna start arguing and get cranky and 	IB4001.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
106.66	So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like and apart from this , it should be having a good look also , because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C.D. player , M.P. three player like any electronic devices .	ES2005a.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[C.D., M.P.]
32.26	Detailed design oh , come on .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
46.96	Could open that anyway , think .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
91.84	We agreed that we would implement both the L.C.D. and speech recognition , but I'll get to that in a moment .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
119.12	So you could could present that .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[]
262.09	So well , we have sin one curve , a design .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	sin	[]	[]	[]
270.31	Suppose yellow is a special colour .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
287.83	What do we scrap .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	scrap	[]	[]	[]
289.89	Well think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
327.38	Yeah , I could take out the push-buttons , but we need those .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
330.18	So , generally what I came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros , spe scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it , we'll just then we'll do it in black .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	account	[twelve and a half]	[]	[Euros]
347.3	We'll just deliver it in black , have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have , and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	deliver	[]	[]	[]
363.96	I'll just go back .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
393.01	to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
396.72	Just keep you just make new covers for the for it , like we agreed before .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
417.95	And yeah , we could take out the curve .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
423.48	Could we could take out the curve .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
443.95	Took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	Took	[]	[]	[]
454.63	So you can change any colour you want .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
467.45	You can take plastic , but I d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls , because they're all plastic .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
484.61	So which in in turn Rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[Rubber]
494.89	I al like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour , which would make this black a black and grey .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
517.78	To ensure the profit .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	ensure	[]	[]	[]
535.92	Stick that .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	Stick	[]	[]	[]
543.02	to have I think they would do .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
545.14	Th I think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea , because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
639.17	So it's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final , it's either turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , um or turn it yellow .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
664.3	Oh that's true , we could lose the c yeah , I forgot that , sorry .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
689.77	Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
694.78	we could make it yellow then , but 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
706.75	So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
913.01	Just create our own option .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
938.37	Maybe you can hear it .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	hear	[]	[]	[]
964.96	I'd use an remote control .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1010.42	So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1015.88	So just make that a two .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1040.85	You can use the L.C.D. in a good way .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1043.95	I think it's perfect , the w where it is , what it can do , if it useful .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1099.64	But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	configure	[]	[]	[]
1137.62	We could have ev even lost the selection button and uh done everything via L.C.D. selection .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1165.33	Oh yeah Just to be a prick , but of course you can talk to your remote control , it doesn't do anything .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
1170.28	But you c you can talk to it .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
1178.58	Well , we did take everything into consideration of course .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1386.11	They sh they should get kids , and just stick 'em in T.V. and say change the channel .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1395.63	Or your sh you should lose the L.C.D. screen probably , but I think that's I think the L.C.D. screen is more worth than speech recognition .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	lose	[]	[L.C.D.]	[L.C.D.]
1415.32	Let's see , what was left in the the Another one .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1480.72	Say , look , this is you're doing the wrong thing , you're s you're wasting your time now , because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
1488.06	So it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh because that's that's what would w you what you would normally do , either call or email someone .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
1565.06	You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	preview	[]	[]	[]
1596.86	Yeah , more communication between between uh that's the thing I noticed , that communication is very um very important , because if you get new information , it's essential f for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible , because you would avoid making doing extra work , because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition , you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	avoid	[]	[]	[]
1681.26	It would change , but not for me .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1716.57	Should i if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget , we should celebrate .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	celebrate	[]	[]	[]
1729.76	Uh okay , think that's about it .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1745.53	Okay , I should I think I sh I still have the the total report to finish up .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1772.67	Just oh , think of a catchy name .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1836.3	Step into the future of of remote controlling your T.V. .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	Step	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1847.0	Control your remote control .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	Control	[]	[]	[]
1909.12	I take f yeah , take a banana .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1943.62	Just write out triple , like a word triple R.C. , triple stripe Oh .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	write	[]	[R.C.]	[]
2055.64	So have to write my report now , I guess .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2077.55	Retire to my lair and finish the report .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	Retire	[]	[]	[]
2094.85	See .	TS3012d.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
120.45	Make a start yeah .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
171.27	Go up .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
173.8	Yeah go up .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
179.46	Go back .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
198.09	Let's go and check .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
200.05	I'll go and check .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
240.6	Yeah , so there's a project I think called X. house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[X.]
255.96	the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	feature	[]	[]	[]
259.2	Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
271.94	Uh so the user interface will consist of two parts .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	consist	[]	[]	[]
330.19	So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
351.6	Voice command w we could specify anything .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	specify	[]	[]	[Voice]
353.43	We could assign any button a command to any button , if we have enough processing power , I guess so .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	assign	[]	[]	[]
677.55	It i can become painful you can have tendonditis .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
690.23	Have to say ha ha .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
1113.16	This will think this will take more time to develop also .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1239.25	How muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no , one hundred thousand units .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1660.84	Well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that I can see 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1784.2	Maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1790.76	Change channel to eight .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	Change	[]	[]	[]
1836.12	Yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1859.71	Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1942.09	Just increase the cost .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
2087.3	So next time we should have a fight .	IS1001b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
96.78	outline our ideas .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	outline	[]	[]	[]
144.5	You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round , so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
158.5	But as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand , the L. uh the L.C.D. is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[L., L.C.D.]
194.46	Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	recommend	[]	[]	[]
478.31	I think w if it was just the sounder then th I mean something I've found with uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	hear	[]	[]	[dow]
1159.63	The curve that's really needed is up here , to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1307.19	Okay , well l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1455.52	I'd give it a three for this for that .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1484.61	I'd give it a three .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1516.91	I'd s I I'd give it a six , to be honest .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1543.01	If I were buying one , I'd go for purple .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1989.45	transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	transfer	[]	[]	[]
1993.41	computer ourselves .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	computer	[]	[]	[]
2212.32	um m would make to sales .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2225.49	Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	cheapie	[]	[]	[Wee]
2300.47	And I can get my bus .	ES2003d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
421.14	Could can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've 	ES2013b.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1102.05	Still , I'll do without that .	ES2013b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1192.28	do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard .	ES2013b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
1519.6	I'll do some research for the next meeting .	ES2013b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
84.84	'Scuse me .	ES2011c.C.words.xml	Scuse	[]	[]	[]
607.92	But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine .	ES2011c.C.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
631.75	So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just I guess I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T.V. like what channel you're on .	ES2011c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[arou, T.V.]
643.52	You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
654.56	'Cause you'll have to like but you can quickly s you can 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
673.31	So you're either you're you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	tap	[]	[]	[]
685.91	uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels .	ES2011c.C.words.xml	tap	[]	[]	[]
723.22	I would think so too , like 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
726.18	So I mean and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of m yeah .	ES2011c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
757.69	You can get to you know , you can 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
760.44	Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T.V. and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the yeah , yeah .	ES2011c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[T.V.]
919.89	If if you can get to , you know if so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T.V. screen .	ES2011c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[T.V.]
936.04	Mean 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	Mean	[]	[]	[]
947.28	I mean you can do it , you it's it doesn't seem that hard .	ES2011c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
993.28	So , do we need I dunno .	ES2011c.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1025.98	So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like okay now I hit this you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .	ES2011c.C.words.xml	hit	[]	[]	[]
1134.93	You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	name	[]	[]	[]
1180.07	I do I dunno .	ES2011c.C.words.xml	dunno	[]	[]	[]
1329.62	So you could make that 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1366.67	We could promote the banana one .	ES2011c.C.words.xml	promote	[]	[]	[]
1403.29	The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits .	ES2011c.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
74.95	Help help help .	TS3004a.C.words.xml	Help	[]	[]	[]
590.22	Take it easy .	TS3004a.C.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
746.53	Excuse me .	TS3004a.C.words.xml	Excuse	[]	[]	[]
965.79	O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .	TS3004a.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
981.49	Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small .	TS3004a.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
988.97	Uh like a a to have Yeah , maybe it would .	TS3004a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1024.1	Uh should you put it in a recharger or a just 	TS3004a.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1089.35	Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , or you can change your batteries , so .	TS3004a.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1174.92	And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you can still uh do the th the functions .	TS3004a.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
4.35	Just put it on the deskt desktop .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[deskt]	[]
155.15	Um , sh would you like to I'll just do it from here .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
166.37	Um , try second one maybe .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
174.96	Try it , yeah maybe .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
347.46	But after a while people may wanna return it , because if you have to to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
364.47	So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
374.84	However , oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the 	ES2003b.C.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
397.64	See , you could there're two options .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
414.18	So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
418.02	But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , you know , it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
482.62	And uh what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wanna use the T.V. , they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[T.V.]
490.92	Um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	account	[]	[]	[]
494.54	Uh , will people return the remote control , I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so , do our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button , it's not a practical .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	return	[]	[]	[]
1239.21	Sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one , but I think we don't have a specific audience , you know , like what is our target audience , what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1920.53	Well I can give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often , I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface , right .	ES2003b.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
576.33	Okay , now work a little with me .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
598.52	need um something like a mode that you can switch it .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
601.09	Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
609.42	I'll tell you why that's important to me .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
630.64	So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
660.22	The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
709.09	Uh here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[Morse]
720.67	That makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
889.12	Go ahead .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1055.0	If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1061.78	That's fo is uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
1113.44	Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1328.13	Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
1461.95	Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1645.0	Uh you could make a device , but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , but it you're the remote also can act as a recharger .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1655.58	So then you can choose , you have every decision .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1660.25	You can uh put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1681.75	You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , you don't need basic station .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1763.33	I would buy it myself .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
2094.63	And the design , it should differ .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	differ	[]	[]	[]
2210.22	M I personally would prefer it on the top .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
2235.11	We should just try to make that if it's possible .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2237.37	If it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2243.12	Also keep in mind again , the L.C.D. screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
2306.21	If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
2311.04	It is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
2390.26	I'll try to .	TS3012b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
93.57	This'll just take a moment .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
123.12	Okay we'll have to deal with it like this then .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
146.51	If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
209.56	Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
223.04	is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , uh , create this product , and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , uh Which brings us to our next subject , is , um , um , as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	create	[today]	[]	[]
249.36	Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	appeal	[]	[]	[]
309.07	Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
319.28	come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
348.34	to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
373.94	And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
417.4	Do come up .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
475.14	Do you have 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
495.68	That's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , that um , that um In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	overcome	[]	[]	[]
524.08	it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	combat	[]	[]	[]
550.35	Right , I'm gonna take minutes while , um , you guys express your favourite animals .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	express	[]	[]	[]
826.78	So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[wanna]
854.49	And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
871.49	to , uh , make fifty million Euro .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Euro]
876.18	Um , and make it for an international market .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1026.27	Any ideas will do that you have at this point .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1034.15	Can hold it .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
1042.05	I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1089.28	Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1095.76	So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1131.17	Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour .	ES2015a.A.words.xml	get	[the next half an hour]	[]	[]
78.41	Suppose I have to do my presentation .	IS1003a.A.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
85.57	So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager .	IS1003a.A.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[Ada, Longmund]
94.12	So um we will have to 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
101.51	um speak about m the project .	IS1003a.A.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
172.02	Maybe you can draw your favourite animal 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
175.54	and make a list of its favourite characteristics .	IS1003a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
223.51	So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control .	IS1003a.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
232.74	Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls , try to create something new and people would like to to buy .	IS1003a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
246.85	And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
254.4	so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do .	IS1003a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
263.49	And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .	IS1003a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
296.6	So I will manage all all the group .	IS1003a.A.words.xml	manage	[]	[]	[]
353.09	And i maybe you will transform it .	IS1003a.A.words.xml	transform	[]	[]	[]
507.2	Product manager okay , let's go , I will try .	IS1003a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
779.67	Just have to 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
781.76	present project , discuss a little bit about it .	IS1003a.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
53.41	Okay , hang on , reply coming .	IN1016.C.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[]
69.9	Um we can maybe get a head start .	IN1016.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
741.32	We s go straight to the semantics of the yep .	IN1016.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[yep]
782.82	How many of them did you get right .	IN1016.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1074.84	So I mean uh you could begin with s saying the a um the simple task of just determining whether or not the speech is related to the slide content , and which is sort of building upon what , you know , Dong and others have worked on in terms of , you know , is it discussion , monologue , from the original M. four data collection .	IN1016.C.words.xml	begin	[]	[]	[Dong, M.]
2059.38	Will it incorporate like uh an S.M.A. and uh 	IN1016.C.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
2147.67	Wh uh the I mean I'm just thinking from practical perspectives , you'd you'd have to the the AMI recognition system that we have now is either for these microphones or for the microphone array .	IN1016.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[AMI]
2162.05	So I mean that in itself , it would I mean you'd have some fun training some more speech recognition models .	IN1016.C.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
2239.3	Do they have slides or anything along that I don't think they would .	IN1016.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2309.41	I mean you just have to think of a a task a challenge that is relevant to that type of recording , which might mm you might use the same methods as what we've been pr talking about today .	IN1016.C.words.xml	use	[today]	[]	[]
2319.51	But the actual sort of what you're trying to measure might need to be slightly slightly different I guess .	IN1016.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2350.31	So you might wanna be doing something else basically , yeah .	IN1016.C.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
2629.46	Although I remember discussing this like um 'cause uh when Neville was working on his his stuff , which was just based on the slides , if um he he asked me all you know , could I pre-segment the slides for him uh , you know , because you wanted to s you wanted to have the topic segmentation .	IN1016.C.words.xml	pre	[]	[]	[Neville]
2849.52	After the after the hard drive crash we took the time to actually rebuild the the the system and actually train 'cause originally we sort of had the idea of oh we'll use a recognizer that's been trained on a large amount of telephone speech data and that should give us a better result .	IN1016.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2887.01	in terms of um you can have like uh a two second utterance , uh credit cards , and then twenty seconds of silence coming after it , which in which when you f when you first think about it , you just think oh silence , whatever , nothing will happen .	IN1016.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2941.29	But also it should actually affect the recognition on the speech segments as well .	IN1016.C.words.xml	affect	[]	[]	[]
3004.1	So use that for acoustic training .	IN1016.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
3013.45	But one can imagine a commercial system uh that that that s Steven Cox used from Nuance probably had all these things , built in end point detection , et cetera , et cetera .	IN1016.C.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[Steven, Cox, Nuance, et, et]
3095.66	We can just run some generic yeah .	IN1016.C.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[]
3191.11	Artem should familiarise himself with the A.S.R. systems or whatever .	IN1016.C.words.xml	familiarise	[]	[]	[Artem, A.S.R.]
3348.47	apply some pressure .	IN1016.C.words.xml	apply	[]	[]	[]
3410.96	And it's nice to get some feedback on I mean that feedback will probably come after your proposal possibly .	IN1016.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
3444.81	N yeah , sort out any bugs or whatever .	IN1016.C.words.xml	sort	[]	[]	[]
3545.38	It could go to thirty seven , thirty eight .	IN1016.C.words.xml	go	[thirty seven]	[]	[]
58.01	In this meeting we will discuss our final design .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
62.36	And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
80.95	And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
101.36	We'll have the prototype presentation first .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
104.31	Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[]
108.47	Then we will look at the finance .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
111.28	Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
131.06	Then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
145.8	we will do the this is prototype presentation .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
428.59	Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
441.03	And I can tell you 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
462.75	But maybe we can also use one .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
482.04	to save there .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
523.09	So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
531.24	Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
617.61	So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
637.47	So you can make 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
863.08	Say Or you can take the single chip .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
909.76	Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
968.0	Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
987.62	But it would definitely crop cost , a lot .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	crop	[]	[]	[]
1012.91	And we can save a Euro by a flat design .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[Euro]
1101.86	I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
1122.75	And we can keep our L.C.D. screen , which can provide extra information .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
1126.22	How to use the scroll wheel .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1127.98	How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1138.7	If you would erase these .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	erase	[]	[]	[]
1252.0	And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1278.73	Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
1313.32	decrease this one to four buttons .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	decrease	[]	[]	[]
1384.48	Ask for more money .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	Ask	[]	[]	[]
1398.67	Just to express our L.C.D. screen a bit more .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	express	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
1404.23	So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1524.95	I would buy it .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1529.52	I would buy it if I was six .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1541.28	But we can go on with the project evaluation .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1549.64	Let's see .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1550.7	I can sit down I think .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[]
1576.98	Go ahead .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1752.87	Think it's uh seven .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1823.91	I would give it a four .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2186.06	Yeah you can export it as image .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	export	[]	[]	[]
2258.53	And then it mediates the score , and you can get one Yeah .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2378.12	You can do more .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2385.17	Just put it on the market for everybody .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2387.89	You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
2396.49	So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2405.97	See how it works .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
2457.77	Or we can put these in the project folder as well .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2529.39	Yeah , I'll just put it in My Documents and uh That's okay .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2574.55	And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes , or something .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
2583.63	Hopefully my pen will download its software .	TS3003d.A.words.xml	download	[]	[]	[]
0.2	Help .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	Help	[]	[]	[]
85.93	I'll go over what we decided last meeting , 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
120.23	Um , our budget would have to affect um try not to reflect our budget , um that we might 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
131.42	have a bit of oh oh you can see it , okay .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
144.85	want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
179.07	Unplug me .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	Unplug	[]	[]	[]
535.92	Or , maybe move the laptop over .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
844.9	Look at that .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
1097.81	But I mean , general T.V. controls do do video as well .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1200.74	We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing um because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1358.4	Um , think that might appeal I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people , trendy kind of a thing .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[Japan]	[]
1452.56	I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1625.8	We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1638.84	because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that , it's just a number .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	want	[two days]	[]	[]
1844.69	But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
1906.74	Um , something like that should reduce the size of it .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	reduce	[]	[]	[]
2043.22	for example , if it was a C. or something like that , you could have it in a vague C. shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2121.65	Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2127.7	You could have different kind of casings .	ES2004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2131.0	So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
110.47	Today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design .	IS1000c.B.words.xml	talk	[Today]	[]	[]
131.68	take some minutes uh again .	IS1000c.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
134.26	Um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented .	IS1000c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
208.86	So did you manage uh 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	manage	[]	[]	[]
539.88	Yes well maybe Matthew can can give some more information on the 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[Matthew]
560.88	Maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel of uh I've it was a good idea maybe to to 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
609.8	Yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get uh after-sales I mean that would would be very good I mean those covers could go for for three , five Euro .	IS1000c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Euro]
631.44	maybe uh we can go a th Matthew's presentation because 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[th, Matthew]
641.01	Together indeed uh , because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use , what you were already mentioning .	IS1000c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[ma]
1070.14	S so do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition , I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[Euro]
1403.44	Well well m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up .	IS1000c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1600.15	Um so I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1617.0	we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features .	IS1000c.B.words.xml	implement	[]	[]	[]
1639.06	So when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip .	IS1000c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1687.64	Mm yes wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price .	IS1000c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[Mm]
1728.72	Yes but I can I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials which which come with a with another price .	IS1000c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1806.6	Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs , one one 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1828.98	with addit uh additional uh , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it .	IS1000c.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
1839.08	We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control .	IS1000c.B.words.xml	concentrate	[]	[]	[]
459.9	Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon .	ES2012c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1108.75	You'd know what you were fiddling with .	ES2012c.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1315.2	Well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , yeah .	ES2012c.B.words.xml	tie	[this year, next year]	[]	[]
1526.85	And that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly .	ES2012c.B.words.xml	whip	[]	[]	[]
1714.39	Yeah , you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip .	ES2012c.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1725.95	Yeah , and fiddle around with it and press it .	ES2012c.B.words.xml	fiddle	[]	[]	[]
1733.46	Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle an yeah .	ES2012c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1790.0	But do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that and it's microphone-esque , yeah , yeah .	ES2012c.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1832.36	Well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons .	ES2012c.B.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
1835.44	I mean uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness and and sc and then you can you can minimise the buttons and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff .	ES2012c.B.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
1876.59	But the television would be the display that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah .	ES2012c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1933.63	Play with play-dough .	ES2012c.B.words.xml	Play	[]	[]	[]
605.35	So I can draw , but uh 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
657.64	Well uh you can guess what it is , I hope .	TS3005a.B.words.xml	guess	[]	[]	[]
748.4	You can try out the eraser now .	TS3005a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
859.97	Yes , perhaps you can integrate them or something .	TS3005a.B.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[]
894.82	You should just give it to .	TS3005a.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
932.85	But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it .	TS3005a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
958.8	But if if it's if it's international you should uh look in think in Britain they have uh different things they can do with the T.V. , or so uh that you can choose what you want to see .	TS3005a.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[Britain]	[T.V.]
969.93	I dunno if you should uh take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal T.V.s that uh 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	aim	[]	[]	[T.V.s]
996.63	Yeah , we can leave that .	TS3005a.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
1073.91	Yeah , you can choose the code .	TS3005a.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1128.34	Guess not .	TS3005a.B.words.xml	Guess	[]	[]	[]
1163.38	Yeah meeting will close in five minutes .	TS3005a.B.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
1203.3	So I should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote , or uh , or how I don't really 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
990.94	Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust .	TS3003b.C.words.xml	Keep	[]	[]	[]
1364.66	Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think .	TS3003b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1380.68	change our focus on the project , and I think 	TS3003b.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1385.01	we can uh we can sell this .	TS3003b.C.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
1635.48	So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .	TS3003b.C.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
88.01	The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up .	ES2010d.C.words.xml	light	[]	[]	[]
331.2	I'd give it like three or four .	ES2010d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
363.16	I'll give it a one .	ES2010d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
934.34	Let you loose .	ES2010d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
448.8	Make mobile phones and T.V. remotes to make T.V. remotes .	ES2012a.D.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
575.16	Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T.V. players and T.V.s and D.V. players , like they aren't 	ES2012a.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.s, D.V.]
628.08	to make make people aware of the product .	ES2012a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1005.4	Um , well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with like you buy it with several 	ES2012a.D.words.xml	market	[]	[]	[]
1020.01	you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , but uh maybe thinking of that , it's considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it .	ES2012a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
664.93	And so think of this concept .	ES2002c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
776.28	Um should avoid s things like that .	ES2002c.C.words.xml	avoid	[]	[]	[]
786.99	Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea .	ES2002c.C.words.xml	tie	[]	[]	[]
830.01	Um we should definitely avoid the big square block look .	ES2002c.C.words.xml	avoid	[]	[]	[]
1476.63	Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit .	ES2002c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1722.72	So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons .	ES2002c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1869.52	B um I think the we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere .	ES2002c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
255.22	Just press the okay button , it works .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
315.11	Oh wait uh wait up .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
654.18	There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , so you can get a really good grip on it .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
671.03	But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
719.67	Okay , but I'll I'll go into that , because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
801.42	We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
811.07	We can use wood and titanium .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
877.36	And you can store the energy in the in the thing .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	store	[]	[]	[]
948.08	So , but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[energy]
969.05	I'll come to that later .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
998.28	You can scroll 'em , you can also push it .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
1209.02	Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1357.37	to think about .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1395.9	So maybe we should think about uh wood finish .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1425.15	It's in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1455.86	So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff , and we should uh use wood or something like that .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1537.55	It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1608.57	And uh skip and skip the L.C.D. part .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1724.52	Yes , they can work .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1728.82	I'll check it for you .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
1799.73	I'll do .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2005.29	Well uh you can use well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2133.83	So maybe they can combine these two .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	combine	[]	[]	[]
2298.15	I'll put it online .	TS3011c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
23.84	Like make the sign in bigger red letters .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
104.79	To actually do the re-install .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
274.43	You guys might actually have something in common 'cause she does , well , you know , stuff for the video coding and gesturing .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
293.22	Well uh no uh I will actually give her the the option .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
464.18	Just change it .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
477.63	Although if if you had a big thing and it was jiggling around like anybody's business , like real eye track traces , then you might find that a little bit disconcerting .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
496.89	It'll look like it's quivering , you know .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
519.37	Oh , remind me .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	remind	[]	[]	[]
593.5	'Cause I could get it backwards easily , you know , and so it is just as well for w for you to check this .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
651.24	Okay , but they may need help finding the something if they can't do X. fig , I suppose .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[X.]
688.17	Just ask them , look , you know say we you need something that does S.V.G. and then um if they if they come back and say ha , then y you may need to poodle around a bit looking for something .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[S.V.G.]
718.12	Oh , so well I can imagine there being uh shapes that you could construct in S.V.G. format that would fox the model builder in some way .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[S.V.G.]
783.99	Well but by self-intersection here , I'll draw here , if I can find the right end of the pen .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
798.66	Um I mean you know , some f rainy day you might wanna think about 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
807.32	I mean it you know , later on we can fix it if it if it turns out those parts it's not urgent now .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	fix	[]	[]	[]
1038.93	Well , she'll have to u use the C.V.S. eventually 'cause we don't really have a good way of doing this otherwise .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[C.V.S.]
1216.87	Um I'll have to look .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1263.55	So I mean this this might be a good case for or it might uh or it might be that you should just like , you know , talk to me about this stuff if I happen to be around at the time that you're doing it and not y so i if the writing stuff down on the Wiki gets to be too high a proportion of things , then then you don't necessarily wanna do it .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[Wiki]
1294.59	Um so it you know , we can do things more informally where f you feel the Wikis are getting in the way of things .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Wikis]
1325.57	So I'll I'll look at it .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1369.41	And uh and so , you know , you could just have sort of well the I think we discussed having it with an English voice-over or having it with no voice-over and then having it w just with cartoon noises or something like or you know when things break .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1393.96	Oh , so we could produce a Dutch voice-over for the same thing .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	produce	[]	[]	[]
1485.37	Or or you could just point to you know , have b great big arrow that points at the two pieces that broke .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
1596.19	If you if you're using it , keep it .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1733.07	Mean , people have been using tamgrams for ages .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	Mean	[]	[]	[]
1798.33	You really only need Robin , right , to to specify the rest .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	specify	[]	[]	[Robin]
1846.0	And I can imagine it's gonna take a wee while to I can imagine you know , so that might be the focus of discussions next week or something , right , that um what need out of this and 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	imagine	[next week]	[]	[]
1860.11	Yeah , so you might wanna try and come .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1862.28	If you get that far , try and come equipped with a list of the kinds of things you want out of it and and so we can look through and see .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1868.36	Um uh y Ellen might have views on what kinds of things once we have a list , right .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Ellen]
1877.24	So , but it'd be good to , you know , make sure once we have a list of the things that we think we're getting of it that it matches her intentions for what we were supposed to get out of it .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1885.06	So um , you know , if we do talk about that , then it might be nice to have her along for it .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
2179.02	See , I have to explain .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
2219.47	I mean I do spend time talking to you guys .	EN2009b.B.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
978.36	Put it colours .	IS1000a.D.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
979.02	Maybe it would help us .	IS1000a.D.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
140.38	Um so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to um 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
197.72	So we'll start with yourself on the basis that uh 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
738.69	So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
819.51	Well th the on the Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
891.09	Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
897.68	Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
913.94	Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut down your time .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
949.76	Limit the number of buttons , user friendly .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	Limit	[]	[]	[]
964.02	Well that's true , yeah , you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , that that makes sense .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1000.27	Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T.V. only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1383.67	Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1406.2	You'd want to try and av just have the one product that if 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1417.39	Um I dunno um talking about vo I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1615.8	We'll also know w when the next meeting is I um so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1623.47	And then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	report	[]	[]	[]
1643.88	And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	communicate	[]	[]	[des]
1674.1	Come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
1696.91	I would guess so .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	guess	[]	[]	[]
1769.34	Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option , but if I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , so uh so clap option .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2056.42	Can bring out when needed .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
2157.88	Channel up and down .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	Channel	[]	[]	[]
2292.32	Well you might get some research .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2300.42	Right so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2304.6	And we'll meet back at I'm not sure .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
2316.72	Come on .	ES2014b.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
107.62	Uh I'll open .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
109.13	Um you should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as I was struggling to our last time uh and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
128.03	Um now you can all give your presentations .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
132.65	We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
152.1	So does anyone have any overall 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
353.19	So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
580.69	I can give you that to click on .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
592.77	Just go up to view .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
755.95	So that might play on what we can do .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
794.24	Well there there is a for example on digital T.V. systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	view	[]	[]	[T.V.]
820.32	So now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	handle	[]	[]	[]
841.68	If if it's , for example , a trainable one then we're just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
884.71	I'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	communicate	[]	[]	[teletext]
1098.55	But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
1525.0	We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1555.45	Yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
1908.56	Well I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1918.4	If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it , but we're really doing that to sell the brand .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1929.41	Uh rather th uh to to to sell for Real Reactions .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
1931.95	And I can communicate this to to the more senior uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	communicate	[]	[]	[mm]
2249.61	The last remote you'll ever buy .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
2278.35	Um need to look into whether we can do that but uh I think we we have some m mobile phone-based products uh checking quickly our Internet .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2309.32	Yeah I think so , without it being too In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here .	IS1002b.A.words.xml	cut	[]	[]	[]
176.57	Um and according to Rolling Stone it's the freshest , funniest and scariest crime thril thriller to come along since Pulp Fiction .	IB4011.A.words.xml	funniest	[]	[]	[Rolling, Stone, Pulp, Fiction]
234.44	Send your complaints to Rolling Stone .	IB4011.A.words.xml	Send	[]	[]	[Rolling, Stone]
238.17	So on the next couple of slides I'll just go through some of um more detailed stuff that we might need for administrative purposes .	IB4011.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
464.04	Let it's a sort of different style from the other movies we've seen , and they have a twist , so it's not your general movie where you just kind of sit through it and go , oh okay , get up and leave .	IB4011.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1432.21	Yeah , but you'd get a different impression if you had bright blue sky and bright sunshine behind it .	IB4011.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1928.76	And then maybe replace the paragraph that you had on the first poster with either shorter sort of descriptions , not even of the whole plot , but just descriptions of the movie or 'cause I think that paragraph is too long , people don't r generally just stand there and then read the whole thing .	IB4011.A.words.xml	replace	[]	[]	[]
2089.28	Um I'd go for Sixth Sense , just because it's different from all the other ones and 	IB4011.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Sixth, Sense]
2217.72	I'll give two to American Beauty and 	IB4011.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[American, Beauty]
2248.24	Well you can keep the format , I mean th you didn't have that many graphics in the first one .	IB4011.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
2352.26	We can ask people casually , sort of what genre of movie they want , or 	IB4011.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
2361.62	Start again .	IB4011.A.words.xml	Start	[]	[]	[]
2363.4	Or go back to the fifties .	IB4011.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
647.84	Okay um I'll do some 	ES2006a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
653.53	I'll rub the features and let the drawing stay .	ES2006a.A.words.xml	rub	[]	[]	[]
687.43	Yeah , that'll do .	ES2006a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1055.43	I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .	ES2006a.A.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[mm]
1145.15	And then use the 	ES2006a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1188.84	Uh we can aim for I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries .	ES2006a.A.words.xml	aim	[]	[]	[]
403.08	So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research .	ES2002b.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
411.48	But anyway , um we might come to that later .	ES2002b.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
572.49	Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible .	ES2002b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[sorta]
793.23	And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide and do you know what I mean , so .	ES2002b.D.words.xml	lead	[]	[]	[]
848.32	Uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics .	ES2002b.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
866.36	So this is what I've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together .	ES2002b.D.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
880.54	Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition .	ES2002b.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
960.18	and I will admit I don't know what R.S.I. stands for .	ES2002b.D.words.xml	admit	[]	[]	[R.S.I.]
982.54	Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control .	ES2002b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
987.19	So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it .	ES2002b.D.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
1066.59	That's s that's sort of the um But I I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it .	ES2002b.D.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
2024.85	Um yeah , just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this .	ES2002b.D.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[David]
115.4	Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the .	TS3011b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
703.81	Okay , make 	TS3011b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
717.51	Of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .	TS3011b.D.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
748.04	Uh well , skip this .	TS3011b.D.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
777.86	So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them .	TS3011b.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
815.3	Volume , they are uh use a lot .	TS3011b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
908.45	And even if the T.V. set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T.V. , and it's 	TS3011b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
954.34	So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .	TS3011b.D.words.xml	beep	[]	[]	[]
1342.82	And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .	TS3011b.D.words.xml	attract	[]	[]	[]
1600.19	And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .	TS3011b.D.words.xml	watch	[]	[]	[]
1697.77	So then we should implement such a but 	TS3011b.D.words.xml	implement	[]	[]	[]
1857.48	So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people .	TS3011b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1864.77	But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too .	TS3011b.D.words.xml	attract	[]	[]	[]
145.72	So we can go to next .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
178.55	I mean do you guys know what I mean .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
219.76	Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	tie	[]	[]	[]
236.33	So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
252.33	'Cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's cool .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	appeal	[]	[]	[retro]
885.11	Yeah , like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	enter	[]	[]	[]
933.28	the better it'll sell .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
991.01	We need to decide , well so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want and exactly 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
1018.71	So we can make it small if we have a l locating device .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1098.35	A phone , whoa , that would wow , that would hurt .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	hurt	[]	[]	[]
1133.72	We could do that , because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1206.09	O or we could like take off this .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1289.33	Oh , then maybe voice 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	voice	[]	[]	[]
1304.15	But do can your can the department make 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1333.01	I mean more more come in a package .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1370.02	We could think about it and come back to it next meeting .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1470.6	Well , you could do some on both sides .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1484.93	have buttons .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1721.61	Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1741.94	So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons .	ES2010c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
183.07	Visit it .	TS3003a.D.words.xml	Visit	[]	[]	[]
849.35	Come on .	TS3003a.D.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
888.55	Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer .	TS3003a.D.words.xml	Guess	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer]
1374.24	Think it has to be shock proof 	TS3003a.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1403.81	Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it .	TS3003a.D.words.xml	Thought	[]	[]	[]
1414.32	But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too .	TS3003a.D.words.xml	drag	[]	[]	[]
18.69	we'll just go through the the final uh the final details .	ES2012d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
49.02	uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close .	ES2012d.A.words.xml	tidy	[]	[]	[]
182.91	Okay for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but uh uh 	ES2012d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
192.12	Yeah , uh no because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item uh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh 	ES2012d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
396.47	l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets .	ES2012d.A.words.xml	exceed	[]	[]	[]
470.67	uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so uh um you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , so uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget .	ES2012d.A.words.xml	fail	[]	[]	[]
521.16	Does anybody want to uh uh Andrew do you want what do you want to say about um 	ES2012d.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[Andrew]
761.94	It will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's it's uh yeah yeah so I I yeah I 	ES2012d.A.words.xml	appeal	[]	[]	[]
826.25	Need a need a calculator for that .	ES2012d.A.words.xml	Need	[]	[]	[]
87.9	Let's see what we can find here .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
131.97	And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
153.41	You can go first , okay .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
912.76	Well , I can tell you them uh from my laptop .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
927.61	Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and of course would make it more costly , I think .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
937.23	Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
947.03	And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
1063.83	Uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers uh of forty plus .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
1351.73	Yeah , and maybe you can make something fancy out of an L.C.D. remote , because it's new , as far as I know .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1406.71	Yeah , and we could make an a a separate menu on the L.C.D. uh screen for teletext .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1817.27	Okay , just make a separate remote for each uh 	TS3005b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2172.0	Okay , but we can work that out later , I guess .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
2264.09	Tap the thing .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	Tap	[]	[]	[]
2355.98	postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , because we're running out of time .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	postpone	[]	[]	[]
2370.69	I will uh write uh minutes , if I can create them out of this .	TS3005b.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1076.01	Oh I would keep it as a candidate , but I don't know , I think for the moment m m guess most of these are candidates , so we'll try to .	IB4010.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1085.11	Yeah , we should probably vote after everyone 	IB4010.B.words.xml	vote	[]	[]	[]
1132.93	I you you recognise them , or you can read the the text on the images .	IB4010.B.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
1661.52	um would keep this more or less this theme of uh history and war and action drama , while showing actually a very new and I would say humanistic view on on war .	IB4010.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1849.56	Um okay , so um yeah , that's that's the point , it's it's a bit grey , and actually if you look at my second page , uh in the trivia I found out that in fact they uh actually reduced the the colour saturation of the movie , just to make it look maybe a bit like the documentaries from the time .	IB4010.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1891.43	So yeah , so I I mean these four points could serve also as an introduction if you want to talk f fo for fi five or ten minutes before the movie , I don't know , in in the room .	IB4010.B.words.xml	serve	[]	[]	[]
2526.24	Wh what about a brighter background , because this one , I don't know how it would show on a wall or something like this .	IB4010.B.words.xml	Wh	[]	[]	[]
2584.55	I I would suggest 	IB4010.B.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[]
2625.39	Well you can nominate one or two , so that we or whatever .	IB4010.B.words.xml	nominate	[]	[]	[]
2629.36	Um I would nominate , well okay , my candidate , Saving Private Ryan .	IB4010.B.words.xml	nominate	[]	[]	[Saving, Private, Ryan]
2639.74	Uh I would nominate also Pulp Fiction , because it's a very good movie .	IB4010.B.words.xml	nominate	[]	[]	[Pulp, Fiction]
2704.57	Should we vote just for one film or should each of us say give 	IB4010.B.words.xml	vote	[]	[]	[]
2723.67	Uh you can write on your paper maybe .	IB4010.B.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
2757.61	I will just remove it this way .	IB4010.B.words.xml	remove	[]	[]	[]
2764.82	I would remove Schindler's List because it's too sad .	IB4010.B.words.xml	remove	[]	[]	[Schindler]
2787.3	Well I mean leave someth okay , so we're left with The Big Lebowski , Usual Suspects , Saving Private Ryan and American Beauty .	IB4010.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[someth, Big, Lebowski, Suspects, Saving, Private, Ryan, American, Beauty]
2803.02	So I would vote for American Beauty , because I haven't seen it .	IB4010.B.words.xml	vote	[]	[]	[American, Beauty]
2839.36	yeah , you can choose .	IB4010.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
2883.16	Well , beginning of May I guess , to choose the film for May .	IB4010.B.words.xml	choose	[May]	[]	[May]
2902.64	Yeah , we can do it like the Tuesday before the Ascensions and that's May third .	IB4010.B.words.xml	do	[Tuesday, May third]	[]	[Ascensions]
2927.85	See you on what , April twenty sixth , or what's the mm twenty ninth .	IB4010.B.words.xml	See	[April twenty sixth]	[]	[]
53.96	Yeah , put it back .	IS1000d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
792.18	So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess .	IS1000d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
870.36	Okay so look and feel , innovation 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
985.3	Get that one .	IS1000d.A.words.xml	Get	[]	[]	[]
1514.28	If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being applying to the the demographic yeah .	IS1000d.A.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1631.04	I'd probably go with three again for that one .	IS1000d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1902.31	That'll basically take us down to the budget .	IS1000d.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2040.34	So it would need twelve buttons .	IS1000d.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2070.1	So we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them .	IS1000d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2530.21	So just look at forget that one and look at that one now .	IS1000d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2553.68	So w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment .	IS1000d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
395.81	I'll try the red pen .	ES2014a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
411.05	I'll have a bash at it .	ES2014a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
430.82	We'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear .	ES2014a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
930.97	Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote .	ES2014a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1042.52	slide four 	ES2014a.B.words.xml	slide	[]	[]	[]
1109.09	I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control , so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise .	ES2014a.B.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
540.83	Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A. might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1117.63	So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[chilli]
1349.89	Absolutely , f for somebody who very often , if he would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1380.42	And just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	customise	[]	[]	[]
1492.37	First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
1538.58	I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	rest	[]	[]	[ch]
1580.12	Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	Press	[]	[]	[]
1658.63	Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	example	[]	[]	[]
1708.98	So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
1764.29	So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1877.46	Maybe we could start with the black and white .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1880.73	That that way we could upgrade later .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	upgrade	[]	[]	[]
1977.09	For the body design I think plastic , uh w yeah we could use the body , for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1991.72	Plast right .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	Plast	[]	[]	[]
2122.88	Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
2130.84	And finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside , it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time .	ES2004c.A.words.xml	ch	[]	[]	[]
430.954	So just walk through it step by step .	TS3011d.B.words.xml	walk	[]	[]	[]
862.1439999999999	Well , just give it a two .	TS3011d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
890.8739999999999	We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours .	TS3011d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
928.944	have the solar , I think .	TS3011d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1123.234	Then you would make a four .	TS3011d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1397.664	I'll give a two .	TS3011d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1477.624	Think .	TS3011d.B.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1751.214	You to take in account that your you m yeah uh 	TS3011d.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1875.164	But y you can if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder .	TS3011d.B.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
2145.4139999999998	Leave it here .	TS3011d.B.words.xml	Leave	[]	[]	[]
555.95	Then you can connect this one or this one yeah .	IS1000b.C.words.xml	connect	[]	[]	[]
819.03	Now you can move I think yeah .	IS1000b.C.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
832.88	It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , go to the .	IS1000b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1099.52	But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1194.25	So maybe we should think of yeah .	IS1000b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1201.23	Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T.V. and you can just walk away You don't have to be near the T.V. at all .	IS1000b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
1224.92	So I can take I think mine now there .	IS1000b.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1232.41	Hmm I can take mine it's okay , voila , mm so mm .	IS1000b.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1365.84	And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but uh uh .	IS1000b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1430.62	And then well personal preferences I would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the uh the f a T.V. and the remote video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T.V. they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
1481.66	Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V.C.R. option and you could play it or You can also think about having like um 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[V.C.R.]
1508.75	I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program .	IS1000b.C.words.xml	suppose	[a few days]	[]	[]
1534.44	In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities .	IS1000b.C.words.xml	browse	[]	[]	[]
1597.52	So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list .	IS1000b.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1796.56	Yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	suppose	[]	[]	[]
1874.61	three like this , actually , and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1894.0	Yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so .	IS1000b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2215.77	And uh basically you can look to the standards of other 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2233.42	Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them .	IS1000b.C.words.xml	browse	[]	[]	[]
2277.32	We can we'll we'll go and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good for the 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
11.52	Well uh I was expecting to get , yeah , though and I did did make it in time .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
117.06	So some the ba basically they only had to how the DOM works , um so I can do the next so I can ge generate D.D.F. files .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[ba, DOM, ge]
137.15	Uh 'cause I 'cause uh ju just so at least I can see how it works with the H.T.M.L. pages so I can generate um the X. so I can generate X.H.T.M.L. stuff and see how it all works there .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	generate	[]	[H.T.M.L.]	[ju, X.]
179.02	Um well yeah but if they will b but it doe does look like it does does that this is and things like that .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
190.48	Because I can just quickly generate quickly generate a web page and then just add and take yeah , add things to and take things away and don't see exactly what's going on at the time .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	generate	[]	[]	[]
234.53	So all have to do is just change it change that sort of thing so it's uh yeah .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
366.72	But uh I'll when and out of the output of the gest analyser does does do some of the processing already , which is what I'll m plan to use that as the basis for it .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
552.25	Ah well ca I can easy I can easy get to mapl uh to Maplin I know where it is off I used to live there .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	easy	[]	[]	[mapl, Maplin]
596.56	Well I'll make sure I make a I'll make sure of I got the f the phone number in my phone so I can call them .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1279.3	Uh have a look .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1279.86	If you th anything prob any problems with it um think there's a Wiki page up for that f for that piece of uh for yeah , for that thing .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[Wiki]
1364.3	Just , you know , pick pick some of them , redo them in in the Ja in the J.C.D. format .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[Ja, J.C.D.]
1372.35	I can easily d easily do that .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1566.76	Um and uh oh yeah , and I'll I can have a look at the model builder as well .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1575.24	Uh and it might worth seeing if we can add a little part builder thing into the um model builder .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	worth	[]	[]	[]
1592.2	But I'll wanna have a qui have a quick look and see see how easy it is to add this things to it .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[qui]
1604.74	Um so if I if I can use the model builder to automatically do that then that would sa that would save quite a bit of work and it'll d save a few bugs .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1706.51	So um but no that's that's fine , I'll d I'll have try to find I'll I'll have plen plenty of uh plenty of questions for you once I once I get to the last stage , I'm sure .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1751.12	So um yeah , well that's yeah , certainly keep me busy until this time next week when we can start suggesting things that might might need to look at for the next stage , I guess .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	keep	[next week]	[]	[]
1893.95	Yeah , I mean I can remo 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	remo	[]	[]	[]
1904.39	Yeah , I can remember when I start being a st when I was sta starting being a student .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[st]
1931.23	I'll I'll uh give you my report on Friday or something .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	give	[Friday]	[]	[]
2240.85	Well i i if if you want if you want the blinks mer merged into a fixation , it might worth making making a cr part of the requirement for the G.D.F. stuff .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	worth	[mer]	[]	[G.D.F.]
2247.76	So to remind me so to to just add that analysis to , yeah , to to it .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	remind	[]	[]	[]
2324.45	Um yeah , so might might worth us us having a look at that and just just seeing what dat is what data is already in the ASCII format and whether you want me to do any correction as part of the analysis .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	worth	[]	[]	[dat]
2571.49	So you can get some some results anyway , can't you .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2711.51	That'll gi that'll give us a starting point for us to sort to talk about it to look for what analysis we n actually need to do on it and things .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2718.6	C yeah , create all the uh switches and whatever else you need to do .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
2728.52	Well once I've had once I've had a bit of bit more look at this G.D.F. stuff , then start looking through that .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[G.D.F.]
2732.78	Start looking through that and make sure that works .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	Start	[]	[]	[]
2763.41	Well uh I use it that useful for generating this G.D.F. stuff , I can easily incorporate whatever functions it takes from into gest analyser when I'm do doing the G.D.F. stuff .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[G.D.F., G.D.F.]
2805.38	I mean but what , yeah , say what what I'll what I'll plan to do with it then is take the is take to the software , find out what functions are useful for us in that , and then use those functions to generate the stuff that goes into the X.M.L. file , the the G.F. format .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	find	[]	[G.F.]	[X.M.L.]
2865.95	Well so so it's so long as it's X.M.L. , N.X.T. will handle it , won't it .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	handle	[]	[]	[X.M.L., N.X.T.]
2942.25	well well will the will the will will do if the trains are tha as bad as today .	EN2009c.A.words.xml	do	[today]	[]	[]
59.8	Okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
240.91	Okay so just could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	list	[]	[]	[]
394.67	Just need to know so I can write it down .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
405.74	We can now have a little look at the 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
503.04	Like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
672.26	No can do .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
711.91	So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[Euro]
730.58	Does that mean that one button has a special form or 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
899.3	So at this point we uh , let me see , discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
935.5	Yeah , yeah go for that first .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1111.03	I'd go with three or four , maybe three .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1154.13	I mean I'd give that nearly a one .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1402.27	Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points , my four points , sorry , forgotten that .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1443.02	Uh as a note we'll do this 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1574.94	Okay uh do you know what , actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , I think .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1896.27	Um did anybody think anything was like really useful , anything was pretty un f 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[un]
2109.88	I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually , like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , um I don't know about anybody else .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2175.1	Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , I thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
2197.64	I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have like something written down , just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings , but 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2286.35	Ah well , maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2381.59	Just sit still I guess for a little while .	ES2002d.B.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[]
788.18	Have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something .	ES2012b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[mo]
906.66	Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the T.V. and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , you won't lose it .	ES2012b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1207.22	Okay well , I can do mine .	ES2012b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1319.28	So basically , what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that .	ES2012b.C.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
1368.58	E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that .	ES2012b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
353.48	Yeah I'll have a go .	ES2004a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
361.74	Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I'll have to have to go for something a bit random .	ES2004a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
421.2	Yeah and uh I'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is .	ES2004a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
705.18	Use all the ones at the same time .	ES2004a.C.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
486.81	uh to do in uh our design .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
504.06	So maybe uh we can uh use uh that .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
581.27	Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
593.56	And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[sen]
619.8	Let's see .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
659.77	The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	sound	[]	[]	[]
686.09	And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
703.62	See .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
712.19	Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
725.71	Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	recognise	[]	[]	[]
740.43	Uh um you can put it uh on top .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
767.21	So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	shift	[]	[]	[]
1404.97	So um uh you 'cause uh Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[Nokia]
1421.43	So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh Yeah .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
1615.37	Uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1722.36	See um yeah .	TS3003c.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
2010.75	Uh to make this side um like mm 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2037.14	And to put uh the the buttons for um 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2055.08	Uh rem 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	rem	[]	[]	[]
205.09	Go on .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
587.23	So uh I bet a big company in uh Korea or Taiwan , like uh Samsung , can give us uh a big discount on the chips , so 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	give	[]	[Korea, Taiwan]	[Samsung]
645.44	Combine them .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	Combine	[]	[]	[]
928.33	No , okay , but just just a wooden uh look .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
980.83	And uh , therefore use fresh colours .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
988.72	Uh , I'll I'll come to that in a second point .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
991.52	Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[telephon]
996.1	To customise your own remote control .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	customise	[]	[]	[]
1024.19	Uh to come back to your question , I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	come	[]	[Milan, Paris]	[]
1126.15	And third , I stick with it , the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1393.99	That you can switch switch easy .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
1625.93	If I got kids , and I could choose between uh two remote controls .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1633.74	One uh w with parent control and one without , and I would would buy the one with .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1779.95	And and you know w uh when you install another device , uh children can still go up to the T.V. , p pop open uh the thing and and and g 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1791.93	go to a channel .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1907.12	To put Yeah , to put it in always .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2141.3	Just leave the other numbers away .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
2148.38	Go on .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
2191.45	Go on .	TS3007c.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
98.75	So , you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[mm]
256.34	And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[ne, prevon, prevon]
268.2	And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[mm]
289.27	You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[mm]
301.54	Well , we'll have this on the screen , on the display .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
335.36	And we do have the logo on it as well .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
591.78	I would think yes , yeah .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
602.8	Yeah , so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
864.33	See .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
887.7	Yeah , it does have yeah .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
988.71	No , wait , a little bit under six .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
990.92	No , wait .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1307.06	Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1360.66	Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
1381.17	But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1522.53	It can come in the same colour as the the case .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1751.76	To express them mm mm no .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	express	[]	[]	[]
1795.48	Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1920.8	You can make some animals .	ES2006d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
351.2	W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to you know 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
704.23	But instead of this I will devise That's our concept .	IS1006c.B.words.xml	devise	[]	[]	[]
746.51	I would make a backlight of the L.C.D. screen with different colours .	IS1006c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
841.27	Okay , what uh there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	reflect	[]	[]	[]
864.07	We can make it in fact .	IS1006c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
984.23	That they can use it in darkness , like .	IS1006c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1089.76	To l to l lock it .	IS1006c.B.words.xml	lock	[]	[]	[]
1684.72	Well , we can make it smell like fruit .	IS1006c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1776.64	to make the like titanium panels 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
45.96	I'll show you the notes again .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
49.81	Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[]
64.06	I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
72.77	And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
80.14	Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
84.39	and then uh we can close .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
88.06	Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh I'll show you the notes .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
147.17	And then uh we can we can uh use the time better .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
150.26	Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[]
557.57	Let's say it like that .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
687.19	But um Well we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
778.32	We we have to get get on , go through this .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
833.98	Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
855.0	Yeah , but just do some We we 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
959.91	Well , look at the costs at this point .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
981.96	Kick it out .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	Kick	[]	[]	[]
993.98	We could make two different versions , one with and one without .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1013.2	Y t come on , w a remote control has a battery .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1136.96	We can also make it flat .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1161.94	Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
1232.91	And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1316.07	I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1328.2	I I'll talk to the managers .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
1346.95	Come on .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
1434.98	We have to dump our titanium , and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , project .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	hate	[]	[]	[]
1584.96	Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an I I like it .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	install	[]	[]	[]
1777.02	pay those uh papers uh that are expensive , I'm not going to uh 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	pay	[]	[]	[]
1784.73	Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop .	TS3009d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
189.3	Guess .	IS1006a.D.words.xml	Guess	[]	[]	[]
341.27	Yeah , mainly , and to break .	IS1006a.D.words.xml	break	[]	[]	[]
420.52	Oh like the phones , yeah , it could change colours , yeah .	IS1006a.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
442.01	Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator whatever I dunno if it's 	IS1006a.D.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
462.74	Or if we should have a targeted re remote control .	IS1006a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
469.25	So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , yeah , size matters , yeah .	IS1006a.D.words.xml	colour	[]	[]	[]
563.34	So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , if you if you like .	IS1006a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[ma]
668.0	Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .	IS1006a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
712.29	Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous .	IS1006a.D.words.xml	e	[]	[]	[]
719.88	Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions , that becomes more complex , but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls .	IS1006a.D.words.xml	watch	[]	[]	[]
802.79	I'll think of that .	IS1006a.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
650.63	Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features .	ES2008c.C.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
709.15	Uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track , next track and play pause .	ES2008c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
757.4	The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T.V. in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun .	ES2008c.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[T.V.]
777.66	So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels .	ES2008c.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
828.38	So we'd either have a small L.C.D. display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device .	ES2008c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
840.39	And that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often .	ES2008c.C.words.xml	allow	[]	[]	[]
877.28	There are disadvantages , an an L.C.D. display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're I well we're I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device .	ES2008c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
886.8	Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T.V. in the dark , but you need to be able to see your L.D.D. L.C.D. display .	ES2008c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V., L.D.D., L.C.D.]
1548.96	Like , to make it different fruits .	ES2008c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1921.84	And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button .	ES2008c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2050.49	Yeah , yeah , you can just and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button , but the volume control could double for that , for example .	ES2008c.C.words.xml	double	[]	[]	[]
131.95	Okay so we can go to the slides .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
148.65	Michael you can go ahead .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Michael]
165.46	You can pull it out first , maybe .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	pull	[]	[]	[]
232.1	And we we do have one more functionality .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
295.52	And you can tele yeah , once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	tele	[]	[]	[]
694.25	Go ahead .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
747.25	So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
766.22	Again I'll give seven .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
801.44	I'll give five .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
868.13	There I'll give it seven .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
995.81	Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[Anyb]
1062.32	You'll have to reload .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1183.35	I'll still give it five .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1336.85	To bring the cost 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1418.31	So we we'll put some extras , if there is something .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1428.49	To reduce the cost , it's okay .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	reduce	[]	[]	[]
1896.62	Integrate .	IS1004d.C.words.xml	Integrate	[]	[]	[]
548.65	You can zap away .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	zap	[]	[]	[]
704.53	Consider the m 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	Consider	[]	[]	[]
772.94	Well we'll uh consider it uh .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
775.55	We'll think abo we'll think 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
780.64	No , we'll look we'll look into that later .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
811.44	Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
860.31	Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the F. F. five .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	enlarge	[]	[]	[F., F.]
896.79	And I then can select I can select on the dings It goes to the next page .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
902.34	Well , you can read it , it's not too difficult .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
949.91	Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
969.59	uh and recognise the key .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	recognise	[]	[]	[]
1033.97	It has uh very little buttons and But it it uh it's it's quite um Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	recognise	[]	[]	[]
1254.16	Yeah , uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages , with different links .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1350.94	Uh you can draw it if you Yeah .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1390.66	We can put it on the on the back side .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1602.26	But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[]
1728.83	Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	centralise	[]	[]	[]
1753.6	But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1866.98	Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	summon	[]	[]	[]
1990.96	No but now y W would we have to choose a 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2069.5	C c can you make you make We can use uh the drawing board now , I think .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[board]
2130.3	As we we we we agreed , we do have a L.C.D. .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2159.26	They'd recognise it .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	recognise	[]	[]	[]
2253.5	But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2258.66	You can just put it somewhere They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2317.8	But it's easy to go If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2372.94	Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the Yeah .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	configure	[]	[]	[]
2414.67	And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	adjust	[]	[]	[]
2448.08	See you later mate .	TS3009b.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
222.61	And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through .	ES2016d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
238.34	And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus .	ES2016d.C.words.xml	access	[]	[]	[]
262.5	It's as simple as you , we could make it really .	ES2016d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
283.75	You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose .	ES2016d.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
614.93	That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing .	ES2016d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
622.98	Just just to use , to find it when it was lost .	ES2016d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
646.18	You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it .	ES2016d.C.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
721.19	stick it on the T.V. .	ES2016d.C.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[T.V.]
973.06	Charge about three hundred quid for it .	ES2016d.C.words.xml	Charge	[]	[]	[]
1178.35	I'd ignore that .	ES2016d.C.words.xml	ignore	[]	[]	[]
1246.74	Yeah you could maybe take out the L.C.D. dis display even , if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T.V. itself .	ES2016d.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[L.C.D., dis, T.V.]
1276.66	Make it a bigger dial .	ES2016d.C.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
34.48	Okay uh Agnes , you can help me for the slide when okay .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[Agnes]
40.93	Okay , welcome back .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	welcome	[]	[]	[]
59.56	Okay , and uh we'll issue some information from uh all of you .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	issue	[]	[]	[]
68.56	And uh I will invite uh the Christine and the Ed and uh Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	invite	[]	[]	[Christine, Ed, Agnes]
93.25	okay , to take the minutes of the meeting .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
168.89	So I will invite uh 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	invite	[]	[]	[]
177.19	So , I'll invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	invite	[]	[]	[Christine]
456.99	if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
486.95	Maybe you can uh add it in that .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
564.63	Uh let me go quickly , maybe if I can go back .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
575.87	So I can close this , not sure .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
678.2	Okay , that maybe Eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price and uh what's uh how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be we sell in the market .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[Eddie]
688.94	Then uh you can come back with your feedback .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
694.92	This remote control , okay , it can be for like universal , to use for any T.V. .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[T.V.]
734.48	Ed , so can you tell about 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[Ed]
908.54	Do you think you can make it or uh 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1099.43	Well , what I can uh suggest to you , Christine , okay , uh if you need some uh the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition , 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[Christine]
1112.92	I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I.B.M. , okay , because they're already in this uh speech recognition part , okay .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	recommend	[]	[]	[Intel, I.B.M.]
1121.29	And uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them , some kind of a technical tie-up .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1127.44	Okay , and uh if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information , okay , and uh you can uh let me know , okay , so what kind of uh the details you require 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	coordinate	[]	[]	[]
1140.75	okay , to add this feature 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1184.92	Yeah but but end of the day , you're the sales guy , so I will come back and sit on your head because uh you are going to give your sales projection , okay .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1236.16	So if you have any uh new ideas , okay , for uh your you can always come up and uh you can tell me if you need any uh s special , okay , coordination , okay , between any uh technical companies , which you can uh hide their technology backup , 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1278.92	Okay , I'll uh hand over to Agnes .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	hand	[]	[]	[Agnes]
1575.09	So for anybody need uh any help , for time being , on this uh subjects , okay , so please come back to me , and uh Christine , maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies to help you for uh make a design uh slim , okay , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[Christine]
1668.05	And uh I'll send you the the minutes of meet 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1712.03	Okay , what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break , okay , then uh we can discuss furthermore , okay , with our areas , and uh then we will come back again in the in the next meeting .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1721.81	So thanks for coming and uh I'll send you minutes of meeting , and uh please put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information .	IS1008b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
158.96	Well wha what I found um can you 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[]
272.9	So maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
349.44	may may could remind some kind of vegetable , some kind of 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	remind	[]	[]	[]
426.84	Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing .	IS1004c.D.words.xml	specify	[]	[]	[]
456.29	to buy a a n a cooler remote control .	IS1004c.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
566.2	Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation , so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
802.28	Yeah but you can u 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	u	[]	[]	[]
1133.83	Maybe you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
406.65	And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that .	ES2016c.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
455.71	So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try .	ES2016c.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
487.42	But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and 	ES2016c.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
505.73	We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further .	ES2016c.D.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
511.24	And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit .	ES2016c.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[Manuel]
521.73	We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for .	ES2016c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
559.62	So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups .	ES2016c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
602.55	So when you buy your remote you can buy 	ES2016c.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
611.7	Personalise your remote .	ES2016c.D.words.xml	Personalise	[]	[]	[]
1560.32	The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it .	ES2016c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1853.65	Could look like a fruit bowl .	ES2016c.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
577.7	Release your anger .	TS3009a.D.words.xml	Release	[]	[]	[]
699.09	Just save it .	TS3009a.D.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
822.89	Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control .	TS3009a.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
840.76	so you can uh use your television and your D.V.D. player with the same uh remote control .	TS3009a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
902.13	Maybe we could make one button to switch between D.V.D. player and T.V. and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something .	TS3009a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1089.12	I can imagine that us 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1153.17	Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1183.38	Yeah right right , and maybe we should use colours .	TS3009a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1303.3	And you can use 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1344.32	You can use it just plain but you can 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1348.29	To make it more trendy .	TS3009a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1393.96	Yeah but then you can use a a front .	TS3009a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1419.99	I will investigate .	TS3009a.D.words.xml	investigate	[]	[]	[]
212.86	Ah , wait , 's screw in .	ES2008b.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
215.3	Push the screw .	ES2008b.D.words.xml	Push	[]	[]	[]
447.93	But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often .	ES2008b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1514.07	I dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range .	ES2008b.D.words.xml	wanna	[age later, the fifteen and thirty five]	[]	[stick]
1789.65	And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your T.V. .	ES2008b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1803.37	Maybe I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages .	ES2008b.D.words.xml	e	[]	[]	[]
1922.12	I mean , like I said before , fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it .	ES2008b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[fru]
2219.99	Oh wait , never mind you can't save it to the 	ES2008b.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
257.75	Yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L.C.D. uh screen .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
264.97	Well , these would be the main buttons , h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
310.91	And so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	lay	[]	[]	[]
316.15	But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old uh phones .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	lie	[]	[]	[]
321.81	Y you you may get the idea .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
324.0	So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	thi	[]	[]	[]
334.24	Uh , you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel , but more fluidly and round .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	s	[]	[]	[]
350.26	And uh , in these bumps you could actually uh put some electronics uh that would you can make a more thinner uh design , and that would actually look very nice , yeah .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
388.92	Yeah , f uh , as colours , do you do you have the picture in uh 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
545.32	Uh , I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
815.9	Yeah , you can ch That's in a menu .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	ch	[]	[]	[]
822.86	I would give it a more a five or a six .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
892.42	Well , then uh then I'll go for four .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
899.98	so I'll I'll go for four .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
938.17	Well , if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , uh then you'd uh recognise it as , whoa , that is strange .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	recognise	[]	[]	[]
1003.26	No , it's it I I'll go for two .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1260.42	Just go on .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1326.5	Well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1381.0	Okay , well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1386.02	And that would solve the budget problem .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	solve	[]	[]	[]
1503.11	We we should assume it i that it is .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	assume	[]	[]	[]
1509.46	R if you uh promote a kinetic um I kinetic remote control , I mean , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
1523.48	No , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1749.39	Try to learn from your mistake .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
1993.89	Know what I mean .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	Know	[]	[]	[]
2135.63	Mean 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	Mean	[]	[]	[]
2297.26	But , well uh I we said uh , no I w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react uh on it .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	react	[]	[]	[]
2303.62	But if you you put a three on it , uh just figure well , everybody knows what I'm knowing , so they'll all just put a two on .	TS3007d.C.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
780.68	Which will also feed into the marketing , because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users .	IS1008a.B.words.xml	feed	[]	[]	[]
797.2	Um , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account .	IS1008a.B.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
56.43	Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype .	IS1006d.A.words.xml	propose	[]	[]	[Sammy, cr]
498.66	Let's uh , yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium .	IS1006d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
667.15	Let's say two , yeah .	IS1006d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
684.8	Change colour of t 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	Change	[]	[]	[]
774.42	You c push here the the yeah .	IS1006d.A.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
829.01	Let me understand well , because I'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button .	IS1006d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
925.38	Let's imagine .	IS1006d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
955.73	I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful .	IS1006d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1077.96	Let's go for one .	IS1006d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1249.5	Again , I'm See it .	IS1006d.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1323.23	Stay longer .	IS1006d.A.words.xml	Stay	[]	[]	[]
1394.93	So think of what we can cut uh here .	IS1006d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1519.24	Oh , we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want .	IS1006d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
804.63	Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
815.72	Um we must decide where , this meeting .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
830.14	And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
856.41	So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[Mike, Mike]
880.68	Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
928.79	For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
964.78	Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
969.79	Um I shall draw this .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1049.47	And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus and that can 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1054.47	Um the video button should be uh an apart button , because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1070.2	This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus Well we we can add another button here , but 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[Menu]
1097.42	No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[Menu, Okay]
1175.63	And oh I think as you can see so , the L.C.D. screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	look	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
1553.22	Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours , and they don't use uh wood .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1636.89	I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1712.59	Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so , so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1723.8	Red red , blue and green you give them or something , and then you can give them uh other ones .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1805.68	Yeah we should do that .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1820.81	Yeah , we can do that .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1836.59	And take it to our rooms and uh 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2034.56	Yeah , but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
2053.18	On the back Yes , you you can , yeah , push that in , so that it is always be there .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
2232.58	Well we can uh erase an animal I guess .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	erase	[]	[]	[]
2409.56	We can better uh draw a design on this .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2437.66	Or we'll get the email .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2448.73	Well we'll wait a few seconds and then we'll get an email .	TS3009c.B.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
328.55	You can you are .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	are	[]	[]	[]
1204.27	But even we can have some uh L.C.D. display , like you can uh de you can just button the number and then it go t because 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1238.36	But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1258.08	Yeah but since we are focusing only on T.V. remote controls so we can have more functions for T.V. uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
1343.94	So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	describe	[]	[]	[]
1366.59	So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T.V. .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1396.43	And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	generate	[]	[]	[]
1418.45	Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1466.75	And then we'll have the infrared L.E.D. source which sends the information to the main device .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.E.D.]
1473.97	Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T.V.s , so some T.V.s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[T.V.s, T.V.s]
1540.03	And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface , so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert, User, Interface]
1556.56	Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , so we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D.S.B. chip .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Marketing, Expert, D.S.B.]
1583.25	this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just yeah , so that we just use simple recog no but but 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1618.07	No , even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1638.79	Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that , because we want to have uh millions and in bulk , so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like then we'll have something like this um 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1663.7	we'll have volume 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1666.5	and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1678.84	No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and yeah .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1698.7	And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number , we don't want like B.B.C. or C.N.N. or something else because 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[B.B.C., C.N.N.]
1757.82	Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this processor and 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1764.5	This really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D.S.P.s .	IS1006b.C.words.xml	suppose	[]	[]	[]
1851.32	Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	suppose	[]	[]	[]
1863.75	They can make 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1872.64	Yeah we can have 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
134.14	You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
138.35	index finger of your other hand , or even I mean there's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
327.73	Uh the menu select button .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
365.29	normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down , maybe with with less contrasts on it .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
469.2	to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
537.16	Here , stick it on .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
631.08	Well that on the iPod , for example , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[iPod]
861.86	I'll give it a three .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
894.34	Um I'll give it a one .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
943.22	We might wanna keep it yellow .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1071.25	The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1083.28	So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1184.65	I'm give it a three I guess .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1408.64	Oh , we'll do we wa 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1623.36	I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information , like what's a single-curved case , how many colours , what do colours count 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	count	[]	[]	[]
1654.76	Do you think we could 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1736.78	People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	base	[]	[]	[]
1833.98	Take me to your leader .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
1841.41	Wow , maybe I should market it to some remote control company now .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	market	[]	[]	[]
1943.22	I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2360.69	Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , I am located 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	pear	[]	[]	[]
2395.24	Just if you like you'd have a remote for your remote , that'll .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2518.33	Lemme go to the web page .	ES2008d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
415.01	look and feel .	IS1003d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
417.75	So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think .	IS1003d.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
451.82	Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
666.48	Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
692.19	Yeah but imagine you y 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
959.61	Fine to coarse .	IS1003d.D.words.xml	coarse	[]	[]	[]
1313.7	No y i it did change , but just imagine we have 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1362.48	We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black .	IS1003d.D.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
1748.02	Tha that would that would make it .	IS1003d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Tha]
1913.21	Cute na 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	Cute	[]	[]	[]
2013.82	We should celebrate .	IS1003d.D.words.xml	celebrate	[]	[]	[]
49.3	I'll I'll fix it .	TS3008b.D.words.xml	fix	[]	[]	[]
555.41	Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that .	TS3008b.D.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
580.98	So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach .	TS3008b.D.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
670.48	And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls .	TS3008b.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
711.7	we could group them uh on one button 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	group	[]	[]	[]
715.68	and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh yeah , how do you say , 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
732.64	we can spare at buttons over there .	TS3008b.D.words.xml	spare	[]	[]	[]
916.07	Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit .	TS3008b.D.words.xml	compromise	[]	[]	[]
949.72	Yeah , I'll have a look .	TS3008b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1128.16	Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever .	TS3008b.D.words.xml	u	[]	[]	[]
1676.45	I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise .	TS3008b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1713.99	Yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah .	TS3008b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[ma]
1736.76	It should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course .	TS3008b.D.words.xml	cost	[twelve and a half]	[]	[Euros]
1787.81	Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course .	TS3008b.D.words.xml	connect	[]	[]	[]
2067.64	Should we by the way draw um 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
570.35	Come on my computer .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
571.67	Come on .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
602.06	Okay now I think for this one I could Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
624.65	Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
651.14	I'll write down our scores up on the 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
746.6	Okay , and p 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	p	[]	[]	[]
826.53	Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
936.88	Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
952.8	Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
961.35	Shake it and the buttons fall off .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	Shake	[]	[]	[]
984.13	So in the long term this can actually save you money .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
986.11	So we'll market it that way too .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	market	[]	[]	[]
1039.8	Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
1103.65	We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1115.47	Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
1137.83	So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1148.62	You could just press six enter , or one two enter .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
1205.57	Could I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1320.68	So you can have banana and kiwi and okay .	ES2015d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1323.59	Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , like maybe it'll become more 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
816.36	I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , channel five , and it will change .	ES2007c.D.words.xml	channel	[]	[]	[]
827.01	Oh , then forget about it .	ES2007c.D.words.xml	forget	[]	[]	[]
870.62	So it will look like something like this .	ES2007c.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
945.06	Yeah , so they can sit there and go like 	ES2007c.D.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[]
1072.28	That does get annoying .	ES2007c.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1398.67	It should work .	ES2007c.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1473.1	You could always insert , yeah .	ES2007c.D.words.xml	insert	[]	[]	[]
1569.16	and um just go creative .	ES2007c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1580.62	And then you can market it .	ES2007c.D.words.xml	market	[]	[]	[]
1720.35	Maybe make it like fruity colours or something .	ES2007c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1863.78	I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool .	ES2007c.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1942.32	and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour wow .	ES2007c.D.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
98.04	Wait for it , wait for it .	ES2009d.A.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
112.27	Wait .	ES2009d.A.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
159.06	That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users .	ES2009d.A.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
187.28	meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys .	ES2009d.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
708.6	Push button interface 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	Push	[]	[]	[]
748.56	So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
756.08	um or take out the back-up battery .	ES2009d.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
825.96	Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
967.46	which I will allow Sarah to take over .	ES2009d.A.words.xml	allow	[]	[]	[Sarah]
1077.54	Um yeah , I was just go on .	ES2009d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1459.58	Be fun with Legos too , like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos everybody knows best spaceships ever .	ES2009d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Legos, Legos, Legos]
1672.77	forty ish I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval , um .	ES2009d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1944.7	Yeah what I'm gonna I'm gonna put um I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports .	ES2009d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1991.75	Exactly uh I will save this into the 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
2007.76	Come on give me some information .	ES2009d.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
2018.95	I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet .	ES2009d.A.words.xml	imagine	[ten y fifteen years]	[]	[]
2098.23	I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball .	ES2009d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[David, Burns]
343.2	Programme it .	IS1007b.B.words.xml	Programme	[]	[]	[]
358.6	Do they have to work together or two separate choice 	IS1007b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
409.03	You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it .	IS1007b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
486.2	So you can open uh three .	IS1007b.B.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
504.37	can you show the next slide .	IS1007b.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
534.61	For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on .	IS1007b.B.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
610.37	You can navigate on T.V. screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T.V. connected to internet so we end in order to access the T.V. programmes by X.M.L. and we need some to do some preprocessing .	IS1007b.B.words.xml	navigate	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V., T.V., X.M.L.]
697.8	So I come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons .	IS1007b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
807.7	So it'll beep if you wanna find it you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device .	IS1007b.B.words.xml	beep	[]	[]	[]
1074.96	Yeah , then we can conclude that .	IS1007b.B.words.xml	conclude	[]	[]	[]
1244.06	Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change .	IS1007b.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
230.01	Oh yeah , just progr programme above , I think .	TS3008d.B.words.xml	progr	[]	[]	[]
419.39	You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[wai]
452.04	We'll discuss them in the usability lab .	TS3008d.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
957.64	We can make it a one .	TS3008d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
993.91	Okay yeah , I'll I'll agree .	TS3008d.B.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1078.1	Uh , I will I will make it a three , because uh yeah .	TS3008d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1865.15	And then we can get a docking station .	TS3008d.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1890.5	But what what can we do 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1933.76	We'll go back uh tomorrow .	TS3008d.B.words.xml	go	[tomorrow]	[]	[]
1977.2	If we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2369.58	But then we could make a docking station .	TS3008d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2719.64	We can do it here then .	TS3008d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
377.82	Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set .	ES2009b.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[wanna]
381.76	Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does .	ES2009b.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
450.35	Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control .	ES2009b.C.words.xml	Revolutionise	[]	[]	[]
454.39	Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with .	ES2009b.C.words.xml	attain	[]	[]	[]
482.44	I can plug you in .	ES2009b.C.words.xml	plug	[]	[]	[]
817.99	And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not .	ES2009b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
986.0	We could have the casing , the the face plates .	ES2009b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
95.28	No , no , you you can start .	IS1005c.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
304.97	Could you please show the presentation number three .	IS1005c.C.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
331.7	Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second .	IS1005c.C.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
364.69	I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it uh later .	IS1005c.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
397.51	And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it .	IS1005c.C.words.xml	conclude	[]	[]	[]
494.06	Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control .	IS1005c.C.words.xml	cover	[]	[]	[]
517.05	And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this .	IS1005c.C.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
546.22	For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb .	IS1005c.C.words.xml	manipulate	[]	[]	[]
883.97	Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside .	IS1005c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1218.92	You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape .	IS1005c.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1313.59	So using some L.C.D.s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L.C.D. responding to fingers .	IS1005c.C.words.xml	touch	[]	[L.C.D.s, L.C.D.]	[]
165.19	So maybe you wanna make some notes of that .	IS1009a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
260.02	Then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal .	IS1009a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[white, board]
268.72	So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board .	IS1009a.A.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[white, board]
274.68	You wanna go Eileen and 	IS1009a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Eileen]
288.1	And remember you have to press so it works .	IS1009a.A.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
403.81	So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera .	IS1009a.A.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
625.75	In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know .	IS1009a.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[ge]
650.78	Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , but I think they only work to certain degree and 	IS1009a.A.words.xml	clap	[]	[]	[]
79.6	Have to get up .	IS1005b.D.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
84.65	Excuse me .	IS1005b.D.words.xml	Excuse	[]	[]	[]
137.08	Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls .	IS1005b.D.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
279.59	And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance .	IS1005b.D.words.xml	note	[]	[]	[]
369.53	In particular , do they want an L.C.D. d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control .	IS1005b.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[L.C.D., recognition]
411.79	Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um I think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control .	IS1005b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1464.6	Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need .	IS1005b.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1469.33	And then we can move on to the more advanced features .	IS1005b.D.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
1605.4	To have some feedback .	IS1005b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1611.83	We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel .	IS1005b.D.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[Petre]
1982.38	Uh um , you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
2045.49	But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
59.92	everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , yeah , double curved , um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different uh , separate it from the other remotes out on the market .	ES2007d.C.words.xml	separate	[]	[]	[]
158.93	change that .	ES2007d.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
525.28	Yeah , have some have some .	ES2007d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
670.13	If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two .	ES2007d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
848.19	Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R.R. teams , .	ES2007d.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[R.R.]
139.58	You're just gonna believe me , we'll go from there .	ES2009a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
160.92	Prove it yeah , okay .	ES2009a.D.words.xml	Prove	[]	[]	[]
521.67	Probably classical , to totally geek it out , yeah I think .	ES2009a.D.words.xml	geek	[]	[]	[]
627.29	Slide it in there .	ES2009a.D.words.xml	Slide	[]	[]	[]
645.52	Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back .	ES2009a.D.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
652.03	Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide .	ES2009a.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
659.99	Oh , now I can think of so many other ones .	ES2009a.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
703.81	It must make all the difference .	ES2009a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
869.0	And negotiate that .	ES2009a.D.words.xml	negotiate	[]	[]	[]
1002.56	Start your minutes .	ES2009a.D.words.xml	Start	[]	[]	[]
270.03	I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy .	TS3008c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
322.69	Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time .	TS3008c.C.words.xml	lie	[]	[]	[]
491.63	Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh maybe a kind of uh whole uh 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[bri]
509.54	Maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
658.28	Maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t to the remote control .	TS3008c.C.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1153.88	Yes , you can put a logo on top of it .	TS3008c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1221.63	Maybe maybe we can make a T.V. guide on it , for the channel you're on .	TS3008c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1235.96	You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button .	TS3008c.C.words.xml	zap	[]	[]	[]
1389.63	Y yes , you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions .	TS3008c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1432.8	Yes , you can put uh a little L.C.D. display on it with uh with lots of information .	TS3008c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1450.92	You can throw with it and 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
1656.19	I will rule the world with it .	TS3008c.C.words.xml	rule	[]	[]	[]
1772.51	We can have uh different uh uh fronts of the 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1840.03	It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1920.29	Yes , w we can do that on the on the 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1931.37	We can make this as a style too .	TS3008c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1942.56	No , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic .	TS3008c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1997.4	Uh , they began with uh t typical uh leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all sort of colours , and w kind of fon of uh of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2038.91	Then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new uh with new colours , new yes .	TS3008c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2113.55	Yeah , or or when you use the buttons as black , it you can use two colours as well uh 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2308.31	I will make one in the next uh twenty minutes .	TS3008c.C.words.xml	make	[the next uh twenty minutes]	[]	[]
81.6	will talk about some 	IS1007c.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
931.78	Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T.V. .	IS1007c.A.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1239.22	You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , instead of use the yeah .	IS1007c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1335.54	Push push .	IS1007c.A.words.xml	Push	[]	[]	[]
1389.42	Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others .	IS1007c.A.words.xml	u	[]	[]	[]
1549.66	You will listen to a peep , special peep .	IS1007c.A.words.xml	listen	[]	[]	[]
1884.5	Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary .	IS1007c.A.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
2027.76	Or we can switch on or switch off the the special , yeah .	IS1007c.A.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
2045.45	Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting .	IS1007c.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
42.24	So we should probably prioritize our packages .	EN2001a.A.words.xml	prioritize	[]	[]	[]
1167.5	But if you were doing a search over the whole corpus you'd have to load them all .	EN2001a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1644.2	Think so .	EN2001a.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
2460.68	Yeah , and then we'll maybe have to prioritize somebody into just integrating it .	EN2001a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
4176.88	Yeah , we can ask Steve if um we can get space .	EN2001a.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[Steve]
4185.66	Yeah , uh we could do that .	EN2001a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
5039.92	Suppose we're just getting on with all our 	EN2001a.A.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
379.48	how we can make it work .	IS1007a.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
461.76	We can think about an interface with uh well 	IS1007a.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
674.62	Yeah in the dis display on the T.V. screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f 	IS1007a.C.words.xml	navigate	[]	[]	[dis, T.V.]
751.96	Please , Norman , draw uh 	IS1007a.C.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[Norman]
879.22	reflect about it and uh 	IS1007a.C.words.xml	reflect	[]	[]	[]
881.28	discuss it in the next meeting .	IS1007a.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
98.74	I'll go first .	ES2009c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
180.03	So we'll have to look into that .	ES2009c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
189.42	Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .	ES2009c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
214.07	Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more .	ES2009c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
227.04	And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .	ES2009c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
281.03	Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .	ES2009c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
300.42	Just to set us apart a little bit .	ES2009c.B.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[]
337.73	Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer .	ES2009c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
343.79	My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on .	ES2009c.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
526.6	As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , it has a consistency of those stress balls .	ES2009c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1057.43	We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1228.24	I would have to side with that , I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1334.5	Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery .	ES2009c.B.words.xml	install	[]	[]	[]
1347.62	Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	cover	[]	[]	[]
1419.94	Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .	ES2009c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
176.1	Mar 	IB4005.D.words.xml	Mar	[]	[]	[]
1097.14	Yeah , you mean you can display some new journals or a new proceedings and Yeah .	IB4005.D.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
1474.12	But then you can create on more spared place in that big three piece room , no 	IB4005.D.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
1542.53	But then you can move administration to the single room .	IB4005.D.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
1555.86	Yeah , and give that room to f some professor with a student or from for visitor with the visiting place or 	IB4005.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1818.76	But even like you can put mm Paola in administrate office like 	IB4005.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[mm, Paola, administrate, office]
90.86	So just do normal battery .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
127.52	But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it's it's flat , and the screen screen is just Well you just have to hold it like this then .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
161.33	Let's do it then .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
257.55	So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	adjust	[]	[]	[]
266.81	Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
339.38	Let let let me see what's more what's more popular .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
350.08	Let me see .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
385.95	Let's drop the speech .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
404.97	And then and then use um 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
468.02	And then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
481.7	And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
491.25	Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Click	[]	[]	[]
494.04	Click again , it's okay .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Click	[]	[]	[]
498.64	Or or under each option , you set a you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
507.61	And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
531.39	Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	menu	[]	[]	[]
684.25	And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
730.39	Then then then you should do everything in the menu .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
770.94	There goes the special co Well That would make it less appealing .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
864.83	Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
895.05	So do d Uh make it a special colour then .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
899.56	Yeah ma make it a special colour then .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[ma]
905.77	Make it a special colour and then it look fancy .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
912.36	Let's let's save it .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
917.76	Let's do it like this , I mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1035.93	Let's make it big .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1068.4	Um well they are in a Word document , which I will open now .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[Word]
1122.91	So do you think 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1127.41	You can you can ma Yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	ma	[]	[]	[]
1131.19	I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
1246.81	You j you just push it in for Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then Yeah .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
1444.09	The button has also colour .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	colour	[]	[]	[]
1489.54	But then we would have to drop the screen .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1581.37	Yeah , uh I would go for the six too .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1632.93	Okay I will go go for two .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1650.54	uh turn around .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
1702.36	Yeah just add them and then uh divide them .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1710.73	I all made it po I I all made it I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	count	[]	[]	[]
1855.57	Fancy look and feel , that's good .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2279.28	You can copy and paste the picture if you want .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	copy	[]	[]	[]
2327.79	Type in your report .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Type	[]	[]	[]
2356.22	Just compare uh 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	compare	[]	[]	[]
2462.42	Do like this .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
2486.07	I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2680.45	And we move more to to working together as team , because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
2691.26	And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	arrange	[the next half hour]	[]	[]
2781.23	I mean uh uh I've made yeah , uh I've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2842.26	Well , it It's use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
2896.77	Check your email .	TS3006d.D.words.xml	Check	[]	[]	[]
470.98	Give it a four .	TS3010d.A.words.xml	Give	[]	[]	[]
538.04	we can put it in it .	TS3010d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
974.98	Um , so if uh I'll have a look .	TS3010d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1234.61	So , wait .	TS3010d.A.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1237.37	I'll have a look .	TS3010d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1747.39	Well , what do I have to say .	TS3010d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
124.99	You may need to 	ES2011b.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
135.74	But sometimes you have to do it it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F. eight .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[F.]
628.1	Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T.V. .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	input	[]	[]	[T.V.]
700.59	And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T.V. which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I.R. but we'd probably wanna use radio instead .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[I.R.]	[T.V.]
711.32	That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
944.41	Well you would have to have a button on a T.V. or on your wall or some place since the T.V. already has power .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
972.15	It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
982.93	Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T.V. so if you need to find the remote , click the button .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1044.65	Um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , I think that's what the phone has , I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
1101.41	Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V.C.R.s .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1237.83	Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1419.47	You can put on your songs and then put on a different set , that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1476.44	and menu maybe .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	menu	[]	[]	[]
1496.22	But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[wanna]
1548.29	Yes we can try that .	ES2011b.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
18.43	Um , yeah , go for it mate .	ES2003a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
85.24	Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , but uh personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design .	ES2003a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
256.21	Oh , um , you can clip them to your belt .	ES2003a.B.words.xml	clip	[]	[]	[]
259.01	You should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well .	ES2003a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
301.96	It'll follow you if you 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	follow	[]	[]	[]
308.26	You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , I wouldn't worry too much .	ES2003a.B.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
311.23	Should have good range .	ES2003a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
432.76	have a dash .	ES2003a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
656.53	Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now .	ES2003a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
722.26	Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project .	ES2003a.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
845.65	Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T.V. , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[T.V.]
953.03	Okay , well we're beginning to run out of time now , so , we've got a couple of ideas , we can we'll have to work fast , um , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind .	ES2003a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1033.18	and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well .	ES2003a.B.words.xml	allow	[]	[]	[]
1100.31	I'd say we finish this one up , we get started , I'll get in , I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody .	ES2003a.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1118.69	Um , as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here , um unless we get told otherwise , and just take the laptops with us .	ES2003a.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
276.06	Let's see .	TS3012a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
291.84	Prefer pen and paper .	TS3012a.B.words.xml	Prefer	[]	[]	[]
313.87	Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb .	TS3012a.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
319.01	I'll just finish up real soon , because I'm 	TS3012a.B.words.xml	finish	[]	[]	[]
340.44	Do that in my spare time , so that's basically an 	TS3012a.B.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
346.95	Now we can forget this ever happened .	TS3012a.B.words.xml	forget	[]	[]	[]
716.93	Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product .	TS3012a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
122.05	Yeah , do you think that's part of the name , yeah .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
224.24	You can get A.G.N. without emission lines .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[A.G.N.]
401.47	Yeah , we should do .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
430.56	Extend .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	Extend	[]	[]	[]
525.86	Yeah , we could come to blows over soft excess .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
579.42	Uh I can agree with taking that out .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
767.18	And should come out .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
826.89	Uh line emitting gas I don't like , yeah .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	line	[]	[]	[]
1518.85	Galaxy with the galaxy .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	Galaxy	[]	[]	[]
1909.09	Damped Lyman alpha Q.S.O. .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	Damped	[]	[]	[Lyman]
1999.2	So we should do 	EN2006b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2538.71	I do think it's a process , I think .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2780.4	So you can have that .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2787.0	So maybe we should do that there as well .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2829.45	Uh do you th I think that goes out .	EN2006b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
402.44	So you you should first train the P.L.S.A. stuff , then you initialise this link uh spreading thing , and then you iterate over okay .	IN1005.C.words.xml	train	[]	[]	[P.L.S.A.]
559.09	But but maybe you you could have some some other labelli li or the task like if if you imagine you have some labelling on of of the web pages like like like for example you you look at at at at at a set of pages , and you have the m the directory entries of these pages , so so f like Yahoo or entries , so you have categories and and entries , so for example you have I dunno , cars , S.U.V. , etcetera .	IN1005.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[labelli, li, Yahoo, S.U.V.]
765.1	So let's say you have you have a a page which is labelled , and you say okay , the the label page two should get should be the one w which it is the most similar to , or any kind of classification rules you can imagine .	IN1005.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
811.47	Then you can evaluate how wrong you are or cu how close you are from the real assignment , the right directory category .	IN1005.C.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
863.0	So you you would train it you this is this is t t all all those links are known .	IN1005.C.words.xml	train	[]	[]	[]
892.59	But but maybe you can you can do just a two step process , first one you have this uh unsupervised task over both P.L. and P.U. , and then you from these unsupervised starts you can know which document of P.L. is close from the document of P.U. or the reverse .	IN1005.C.words.xml	do	[]	[P.L., P.L.]	[P.U., P.U.]
910.4	And you can infer some label to a document of P.L. .	IN1005.C.words.xml	infer	[]	[P.L.]	[]
992.84	But but here you can you you say given a random page of P.U. , which of those two model is more likely to to to to to say for example that thi the page of P.L. which is the most similar , so you so so from this so you take any distribution comparison things , so so Hoffmann in his paper was doing just cosine similarity , but you can do anything .	IN1005.C.words.xml	do	[]	[P.L.]	[P.U., Hoffmann]
1029.29	And so with that you can you can determine for example for a document o of the set two to the most similar 	IN1005.C.words.xml	determine	[]	[]	[]
1075.71	So you would have a set of keywords , the set of image label with keywords , and he has a set of unlabelled image with some , and it would check whether the the label he assigns , so in this case annotation word h are correct .	IN1005.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1226.98	Yeah , you can have tree setups , uh yeah .	IN1005.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1326.5	It's it's more like if you were giving the people you you said to them okay , uh divide me this bunch of documents into five topics , and you don't give them the topics a priori , you know .	IN1005.C.words.xml	divide	[]	[]	[]
1338.74	So the two person could come up with very different one is very interesting i in 	IN1005.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1443.34	But eve ev even someone would would provide very different labels , like like someone would say it's a page in English , someone would say it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a web page uh wh which has very few uh information in it or anything .	IN1005.C.words.xml	eve	[]	[]	[English]
1490.21	If you just take one of them alone , so you take all the P. of Z. given D. and all of the P. of W. given giv given Z. , you you you can do anything with that .	IN1005.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[P., Z., D., P., W., giv, Z.]
1536.45	And if you look at the two the d all possible pairs of marble , you would have some mu much more agreement between people than than if you look at the predefined sets people would would just cut at some precise uh point .	IN1005.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2092.93	And then maybe you can find some patterns that are then then once you have the once you have the task , you could look at at which pages are completely missed by one model , which others are are successful with one model , and and you can maybe infer some some rules afterwards .	IN1005.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2110.8	But if you have no task , you can uh blindly select s good alphas .	IN1005.C.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
2118.61	Like like if if you look at uh if you look at your task and you see that , I dunno uh , the the long pages for example have good P.L.S.A. model without fusing links , so then you can infer some heuristics like okay , the alpha should be proportional to the lengths or anything like that , or to the number of image in the pages , or anything .	IN1005.C.words.xml	infer	[]	[P.L.S.A.]	[]
2140.16	But you should have some some task where you can individually look at the performance on every on every page .	IN1005.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2148.69	And and and and at as a second step you could infer some kind of rule about how to select alphas with respect to the task .	IN1005.C.words.xml	infer	[]	[]	[]
2269.68	So you you can select only the links which are within the article or within the categories or it's it's it's well-structured , it's it's uh easy to manipulate and 	IN1005.C.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
2284.31	You can even isolate the directory from the categories of Wikipedia .	IN1005.C.words.xml	isolate	[]	[]	[Wikipedia]
2336.26	But you could just use the whole corpus like this , and and for some of them you assume you don't know the the category assignment .	IN1005.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2344.69	And then you can run this set of experiments over Wikipedia .	IN1005.C.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[Wikipedia]
2369.33	But you can you can think also at at other uh task like that .	IN1005.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2373.05	Like for example you can take proceedings and assume the categories are the keywords of the of the d of the documents , and then if you have the archive of a journal , you can you can use the l the links between uh the citation links .	IN1005.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2388.84	So if you want to have a bigger stuff so Wikipedia would be kind of very small with lots of Engli in links , and then if you take a journal you will have less links and and more documents .	IN1005.C.words.xml	have	[]	[Engli]	[Wikipedia]
2409.12	So you you you can find examples which are not the web I think it's good to work in closed set .	IN1005.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
93.04	So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff , then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
111.2	And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
180.1	So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	fulfil	[]	[]	[]
190.42	And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[interf]
205.97	And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	consist	[]	[]	[]
220.8	So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[white, board]
372.21	Olivier , do you want to 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
377.85	Okay I go , but next time you'll do something I'm sure .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
393.86	Maybe I can draw like 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
435.65	Let's move on .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
476.74	On yeah you you can suggest points like this .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[]
592.04	Fit in your hand , yeah .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	Fit	[]	[]	[]
604.68	To , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	resist	[]	[]	[]
655.67	But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	bulk	[]	[]	[]
665.78	Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
692.87	Maybe we can have uh 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
697.32	Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
764.11	Okay so try to find that for next meeting .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
776.35	So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
788.59	So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[User, Interf, Interface, Designer]
805.28	And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[Market, Expert]
822.55	And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
858.05	Anyway you will receive some messages .	IS1001a.A.words.xml	receive	[]	[]	[]
120.98	As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , um become acquainted with each other , um have a little training on tools , uh create a plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total .	ES2013a.A.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
153.36	Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you , Sarah .	ES2013a.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[Sarah]
160.53	Um and we'll get on with it .	ES2013a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
163.65	Okay , so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design .	ES2013a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
191.76	And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around .	ES2013a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
437.58	Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best .	ES2013a.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
560.0	To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking .	ES2013a.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
590.44	You'd have to sell four million .	ES2013a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
205.46	I've save it on my computer , my presentation .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
249.07	Wait .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
334.64	Open it .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	Open	[]	[]	[]
402.94	Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
409.25	With a little bit of science , uh you I will show that uh in in a few minutes .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
414.21	And then uh what I'll think about it .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
488.01	And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
500.82	And that will send it to your television .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
521.72	Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
529.03	Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
539.41	We can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
549.0	And on the T.V. you can uh switch into the menu .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[T.V.]
558.73	Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
564.18	Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	have	[a week]	[]	[]
567.79	And also the bleep , when what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
596.28	Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
646.12	And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
668.62	And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
682.25	But Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Nokia]
691.53	To change covers .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
697.41	And then you can put a red cover on it .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
712.79	And then you can buy the covers .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
733.25	Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1571.65	'Kay , we'll just have to do that .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Kay]
1684.61	To change to the next channel , just one button .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1687.25	To move up , move down .	TS3010b.C.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
199.47	somehow stupid , so so first do the frame by based uh estimate , and then you you get stick to hundred hertz sampling , ten millisecond sampling or uh something , and then you just pick up the trajectory .	IN1007.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
400.38	So please stay .	IN1007.A.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
674.58	But he will have it again .	IN1007.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1014.18	You may almost want to dis uh um i b uh uh uh yeah , uh b use the white-board , I mean uh and uh that's why we have it here , right , so that 	IN1007.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[dis]
1234.89	Uh where you really w if you want to g do a good voice speech , uh you'll want to get the lower bands correct .	IN1007.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1318.68	The only problem would be if but you know , nobody can beat p Petr uh Petr Motlicek anymore in I mean if even if if Nokia knows everything if you if you sell it tomorrow who did you work for th the uh uh text no , t H.P. H.P. .	IN1007.A.words.xml	beat	[tomorrow]	[H.P. H.P.]	[Petr, Petr, Motlicek, Nokia]
1334.1	They will take half a year before they would even realise what it is .	IN1007.A.words.xml	take	[half a year]	[]	[]
1369.1	To get the uh 	IN1007.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1389.05	When you comp uh w what you com when you compress the effectively they'll want the signal which we are modelling .	IN1007.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1398.94	Essentially if you were in spectral domain you would compress the power spectrum .	IN1007.A.words.xml	compress	[]	[]	[]
1419.48	So you can always expand it back so that you get the c that you get a fit to the to the original thing , except that if it is different .	IN1007.A.words.xml	expand	[]	[]	[]
1436.32	So we can tell you a little bit more about it .	IN1007.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1559.4	I should know .	IN1007.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1560.09	But statistic and uh and something approaches .	IN1007.A.words.xml	statistic	[]	[]	[]
1619.96	Yeah , uh but um so whatever you g whatever you get hands on from Les Atlas uh for over past five years uh regardi this two years ago , last year on one of the ICASSPs he had like five papers , right .	IN1007.A.words.xml	regardi	[over past five years, this two years ago, last year]	[]	[Les, Atlas]
1671.06	To fill in , yeah , with all kinds of parameters .	IN1007.A.words.xml	fill	[]	[]	[]
1866.88	We'll we'll uh we will we'll try something , let's see what we can do .	IN1007.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1926.2	So if we uh if uh if we you can hold him to his word .	IN1007.A.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
1938.34	Browse through the meeting .	IN1007.A.words.xml	Browse	[]	[]	[]
2000.88	I've it's uh i it I should have at least four .	IN1007.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2177.55	Because just to make sure that and yeah .	IN1007.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2284.61	But it just like it's a little bit like writing thesis , all the time re-writing and change the do make a little changes and uh uh and 	IN1007.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1.45	Wait for the marketing director actually , so .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
32.9	We're about to start , so have a seat .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
45.43	I'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
47.24	Okay , that was just to get to know each other , have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project , so 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
60.2	I will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
82.89	And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts , so .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
89.78	Take it .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
114.95	You should close it on your own notebook , I guess .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
200.6	Okay , just talk ahead .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
245.41	Okay , we can we can hide those under a menu or something , okay .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	hide	[]	[]	[]
298.59	Preview what's on the channel .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Preview	[]	[]	[]
303.74	That sounds too It's possible , but uh I think it's expensive , but do continue .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	continue	[]	[]	[]
349.62	Let's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , so it recognises your favourite channel .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
379.6	No problem , it's it's okay , that's Yeah , go ahead .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
467.29	Okay , so have it more make it more durable actually .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
496.68	Make it make them bigger .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
665.41	You mean integrate them all into the circuit board .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[circuit, board]
736.7	I'll get back to my thing then .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
780.54	Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
854.47	Or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	sh	[]	[]	[]
858.23	And sell the covers separately , for example .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
860.51	That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	p	[]	[]	[]
906.56	What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L.C.D. screen but with a preview , but y I'm not sure if it's even possible .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
929.13	I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your T.V. and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[T.V.]
935.39	I think it's easy to implement , we should go for that .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1031.51	Um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1054.1	Let's see .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1097.59	you could For example , if your buttons are faded , after I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1125.47	Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , I'm not sure which which is easier , so 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1167.32	I mean it should be very intuitive , s Yeah , it should speak for itself .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
1189.39	Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T.V. .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1336.76	Yeah , then then you could do everything I suppose , because usually the T.V.s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it's okay .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[T.V.s]
1387.73	I mean what do you want , do you want , but 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1403.51	Let's see that you what would be handy .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1410.68	Let's see one , two God damn it .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[God]
1420.79	Let's see what I think this should these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1428.79	Think it's like this .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1431.47	Withi within the Yeah , just take it .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[Withi]
1441.06	Do you take triangles or 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1443.92	Um I think it should be I think it Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1488.5	We could do that .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1527.61	Yeah , that's true , you should I think the bu the power button should be on top , 'cause it's the first thing you do , turn it on .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1544.81	Turn the sound off .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Turn	[]	[]	[]
1569.27	Take this out and here see 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
1595.5	Okay , should we chan okay , this two , channel 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	chan	[]	[]	[]
1671.77	Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	insert	[]	[]	[]
1697.15	It's a very small Yeah , I'm drawing it big now , but So you can put your remote on flat for example .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1792.01	Maybe yeah , or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1796.28	We are going for twenty five Euros sales price , but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , uh we just have to see what it looks like .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[Euros]
1888.35	Yeah , draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , so the more less important 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1899.24	Just play a little with this , put l shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1904.96	Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	post	[]	[]	[]
2037.44	Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	pay	[]	[]	[]
2054.17	Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , because if apparently it's what people want , it's supposed to be a luxurious remote , maybe it's not even that expensive .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2061.55	Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2084.33	Yeah , we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2126.74	I mean we can stick it in in there , I think .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
2140.66	Let's take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap uh came up with .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2146.2	I'll just make it a little bigger now .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2160.24	So then we should probably put it here .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2168.71	Think it's a good place , people don't 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
2213.31	You would prefer it n Okay .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
2218.87	Okay , but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2279.95	For up and down , ma make it a circle on it , because it 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[ma]
2297.76	You can make it as big as you want .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2359.43	You could have it for example 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2386.78	Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space .	TS3012b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
607.11	Um to save you getting off your backside .	ES2003b.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
681.19	V.C.R. presumably into that then there's a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , so forth .	ES2003b.A.words.xml	stop	[]	[]	[]
718.33	something that is more programmable , that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want .	ES2003b.A.words.xml	specify	[]	[]	[]
730.62	Um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , and have a disp you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Ebenezer]
1201.96	I mean I w I would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white .	ES2003b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1214.67	Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down .	ES2003b.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1218.14	Um I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first , you know , oh colour's out , we'll have to replace it won't we .	ES2003b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1355.5	I th the thing I like about the uh the uh joystick is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for for T. T. for T.V. remote alone , you could put 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[joystick, T., T., T.V.]
1375.68	You can pack all that onto was onto a single control .	ES2003b.A.words.xml	pack	[]	[]	[]
1527.62	Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
2026.45	You know I think I mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that , save us the bother , then that's you know vast amounts of sales .	ES2003b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
156.77	Just have a look , are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
185.02	Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	Fir	[]	[]	[]
266.1	so you can read .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
286.48	So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
299.72	Use pen format .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
304.79	and a different colour can use here no I just take the pink .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
320.89	Okay uh just take what I'm going to draw is an elephant .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
327.7	Just draw slowly , because otherwise it won't work .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
387.73	for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
492.71	Uh do you have to write down why uh that doesn't matter , just it's to get used to the whiteboard , but it's okay .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
498.8	Just make a new blank new blank page .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
568.78	Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , so that no , to the yeah .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
599.52	Use your fantasy .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
758.13	So can someone make a 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
766.61	Uh so we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything , so just have a look how it we think about remote controls .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
847.11	So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1016.63	You can put games on your remote control .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1027.87	Oh maybe that's a good idea , just to put it on your television and just s recharge , you never have to use any batteries .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1223.19	Just think about it .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1273.88	Just if what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have .	TS3004a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
74.59	Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch .	ES2011c.A.words.xml	hope	[]	[]	[]
88.02	Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting .	ES2011c.A.words.xml	review	[]	[]	[]
646.96	But but imagine someone with s 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
654.28	Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
718.68	I mean with that many options , you'd uh I'd think that the screen would be better , because you could have that menu option , sort of 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
771.8	So it would have all these different options of changing 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
834.74	So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before .	ES2011c.A.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
916.52	Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah .	ES2011c.A.words.xml	flip	[]	[]	[]
1164.29	And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there .	ES2011c.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1228.07	Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit .	ES2011c.A.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
1244.17	And like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there .	ES2011c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1260.16	It's almost like your thumb is farther up , so if if you could squish it lower then 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	squish	[]	[]	[]
1439.1	Um , so what d but what do we know about 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1589.83	So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach .	ES2011c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[mm]
1595.76	See you soon .	ES2011c.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
195.49	Well we will try .	TS3010a.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
860.63	And it should work with as many uh as possible of them .	TS3010a.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
840.76	Um so so can I just ask w w now you just uh aligned d uh sorry , you circle the word in the in the outline which didn't 	EN2006a.D.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1472.8	Did did you resolve the the li the different um segmentations , like uh the main problem was 	EN2006a.D.words.xml	resolve	[]	[]	[li]
200.05	Okay , I'll draw .	ES2011a.C.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
200.66	I'll draw one .	ES2011a.C.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
203.5	Make sure my things here .	ES2011a.C.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
659.66	I think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you I mean you always know where your T.V. is , so just have a call button , I've always wanted that , so like you can push a button on your T.V. Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .	ES2011a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
793.03	Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah .	ES2011a.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1075.1	What effect should the thing ha should it have , okay .	ES2011a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
124.04	Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh 	TS3010c.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
132.84	uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already .	TS3010c.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
147.63	The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine .	TS3010c.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
157.38	Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel .	TS3010c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
302.77	But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case .	TS3010c.B.words.xml	recommend	[]	[]	[]
1249.27	And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger .	TS3010c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1952.44	turn it inside .	TS3010c.B.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
4.5	Because otherwise I will already open it .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
127.71	People , welcome back .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	welcome	[]	[]	[]
188.61	We'll come to that later , I g I think .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
201.81	Um we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
448.1	You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
627.22	And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
880.64	I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	hook	[]	[]	[]
1109.28	And click it to muten the device .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1122.3	uh make it a little different than the traditional ones .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1492.75	But but do we want the curved uh uh design , or 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1565.65	If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably you're probably right .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1570.96	But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1641.76	Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it , because 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1668.94	I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Ruud]
1674.87	um add or or maybe thoughts or 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1683.05	Roo , do you have any other 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1742.53	Keep it in mind .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	Keep	[]	[]	[]
1786.74	Yeah , it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1797.53	Um maybe one of you could write it down .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1881.51	Except for the yellow of course , but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2025.98	Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2071.58	You could place a um uh this this would be the button .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	place	[]	[]	[]
2078.43	And you could place 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	place	[]	[]	[]
2137.72	Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2253.64	With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions .	TS3011c.A.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[]
93.56	So we uh we will wait for Anna , a few minutes .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[Anna]
126.94	So I will try to get my presentation running .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
167.57	Just try .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
212.93	Yes and you can put can clip it uh on your 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
240.34	So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
255.03	See what our roles are in this project .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
267.9	to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	communicate	[]	[]	[]
277.53	we will also try to uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
288.56	Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
301.7	Uh then we will uh discuss uh , well , how it should be and uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
309.62	wh what uh what our new product should look lite like .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	wh	[]	[]	[]
352.04	I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
357.68	But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
401.41	then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
426.45	Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
445.88	And um well it should work uh I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
478.02	Yes well we will then find out ho how it works .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
492.0	So , we'll come to that later .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
495.3	So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
504.97	I would suggest uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[]
508.8	Well , yes , um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
553.6	Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna , maybe you can start .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	someo	[]	[]	[Anna]
556.82	Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
594.54	So draw it .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
595.05	We will try to guess what it is .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
790.23	Can you can meet them in Africa , I think .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[Africa]
936.67	Let's see .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1033.78	Let's continue to uh to the real stuff .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1059.08	designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh People uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[Mael]
1095.07	Uh we will try to uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1165.08	And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1182.06	Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	mention	[]	[]	[]
1198.92	Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1285.38	to specify in this first phase of of the project .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	specify	[]	[]	[]
1341.49	Uh w y you two should should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	should	[]	[]	[]
1389.54	w we can leave that out , I think .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
1457.14	well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions .	IS1000a.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1487.12	Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
0.02	'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is , so in that sense so it does kind of make sense , yeah .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
919.73	Let me just get this going first .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
963.21	So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process , um and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
981.76	The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
994.38	Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1029.76	So just go through it in the components .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1073.88	I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
1090.69	um but um I could check back for you , but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
1129.96	Um and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1415.13	So you could trigger that to a light , like I said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	trigger	[]	[]	[sorta]
1586.93	Does it need with a square thing wha 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1844.5	You could put a game on it .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1888.37	Um maybe you wanna draw onto the 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2130.2	Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
2132.27	Um it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , but not for channels right .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
2235.31	That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2322.56	Feel like fruit .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	Feel	[]	[]	[]
2365.27	Okay , can I just swipe your power cable , I don't think it matters .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	swipe	[]	[]	[]
2399.93	I'm gonna take the microphones , 'cause it's too lazy t take them off again .	ES2002c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
918.43	But so yes dependable , and have a good medium range size .	ES2012a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1046.26	Well you could come up with like novelty ones , like they've done with the the mobile phones , you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like oh I want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money .	ES2012a.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
269.75	I'll wait .	ES2010d.A.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
326.28	Oh , and ma it's a prototype , right .	ES2010d.A.words.xml	ma	[]	[]	[]
346.24	Imagine , since we obviously don't have that .	ES2010d.A.words.xml	Imagine	[]	[]	[]
374.55	Go right ahead .	ES2010d.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
421.69	I'd go for a three or four on that one , so okay , let's go for a three point five .	ES2010d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
500.47	If so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit .	ES2010d.A.words.xml	proceed	[]	[]	[]
521.6	Do I just put quantity being one battery , or 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
583.96	Okay , so we can just go um .	ES2010d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
655.4	We can go to 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
682.64	Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership , um teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas .	ES2010d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
765.04	Did you work well together in there , and 'kay .	ES2010d.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
881.27	But I do like iPods , go figure .	ES2010d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
890.67	I mean how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates .	ES2010d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[Nokia]
93.12	So that we can move onto the second uh phase .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
137.47	Uh this time I will take the minutes .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
153.65	So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
574.62	Yeah you can take your time .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1136.82	So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	suit	[]	[]	[]
1262.38	Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1393.12	uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
1489.48	make that um 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1505.87	For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1535.32	So to keep it simple .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1562.0	But do you need 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1566.54	But do you need the buttons for one to zero .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1577.11	Maybe we can use uh 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1594.5	Just look if you look at telephones .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1642.36	Yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	reconsider	[]	[]	[]
1681.93	You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1687.63	And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1701.66	To operate only the T.V. yeah .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	operate	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1764.56	Do you think the docking station will 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1824.57	So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	implement	[]	[]	[]
2020.51	target the real elderly people .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	target	[]	[]	[]
2108.08	I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2124.58	So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , uh requirements , and the trends which are uh going on .	TS3003b.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
62.43	To discuss uh , yeah , the project Alexandre and uh Jean-Marc uh proposed 	IN1014.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[Alexandre, Jean, Marc]
78.09	And so we will start with uh an introduction .	IN1014.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
120.44	Maybe you can access through the network .	IN1014.C.words.xml	access	[]	[]	[]
139.08	Should work .	IN1014.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
156.59	And mayb maybe you we can do that at the white-board .	IN1014.C.words.xml	mayb	[]	[]	[]
454.45	And they w they uh already worked on uh a European project called InDiCo , where they they have uh release , deliver , a full um kind of conference uh uh software .	IN1014.C.words.xml	deliver	[]	[]	[InDiCo]
469.47	And uh to to manage uh all the the conference aspects uh uh we have in a conference automatically .	IN1014.C.words.xml	manage	[]	[]	[]
728.02	To c to capture 	IN1014.C.words.xml	capture	[]	[]	[]
1895.38	But um what we have , what we can do and how we will be able to do , I was thinking uh for instance uh in th in what we have um uh because I don't know a lot about um using uh like uh D.L.L. , M.F.C. , uh uh Microsoft software .	IN1014.C.words.xml	do	[]	[M.F.C.]	[D.L.L., Microsoft]
1930.84	And and actually I c um I can start playing and uh looking at the this uh in detail .	IN1014.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1968.72	Then um the audio video card um so so uh first uh we need to look at this , to look at the demos that are uh i with the what they call the S.D.K. uh software development kit .	IN1014.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[S.D.K.]
2403.3	Ye well , we would look both at .	IN1014.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2542.27	Let's see .	IN1014.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2542.79	From fro for checking Darren's code , et cetera we can expect until uh 	IN1014.C.words.xml	expect	[]	[]	[Darren]
2676.8	And we can ask help uh 	IN1014.C.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
3040.95	Uh maybe we can in the process we can ask for 	IN1014.C.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
3052.9	To work on that .	IN1014.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
3293.34	And I would okay , maybe you won't like my answer but I would say that um we ch we we start but we h we really have to start on working wi uh reading all the code from Darren .	IN1014.C.words.xml	okay	[]	[]	[wi, Darren]
3338.38	Let's do that .	IN1014.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
3603.88	Uh and uh and from there it would m yeah .	IN1014.C.words.xml	m	[]	[]	[]
3667.96	But uh uh the the student should have knowledge about M.F.C. with oh okay .	IN1014.C.words.xml	have	[]	[M.F.C.]	[]
198.23	You know you could you could do it yourself actually .	ES2010b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
203.24	Put it in Project Documents , yeah .	ES2010b.C.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[Documents]
228.64	Um well , the function of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera .	ES2010b.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
249.35	Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
266.77	volume going up and down , and then mute , 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	mute	[]	[]	[]
271.99	And then functions for V.H.S. , D.V.D. , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter .	ES2010b.C.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[V.H.S., D.V.D.]
294.88	And we can decide if that's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T.V. itself , for example .	ES2010b.C.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[T.V.]
451.35	Wait .	ES2010b.C.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
536.87	Wait , is that like your 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
678.74	You know like go to the base .	ES2010b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
715.22	Help me .	ES2010b.C.words.xml	Help	[]	[]	[]
1012.39	It'll give you the sports .	ES2010b.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1024.44	You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , you know it's like 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
1163.32	We should go for the lowest denominator .	ES2010b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1295.92	Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery .	ES2010b.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1331.76	Well , then we could If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic .	ES2010b.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1381.06	Well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it .	ES2010b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1642.68	And then add a 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
91.56	I shall close the door .	TS3011a.C.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
610.72	Well , I'll give it a try .	TS3011a.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
803.72	So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities .	TS3011a.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
816.51	Uh I also will propose some uh um 	TS3011a.C.words.xml	propose	[]	[]	[]
829.36	Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .	TS3011a.C.words.xml	remind	[]	[]	[]
882.9	We should discuss that .	TS3011a.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
884.62	Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other .	TS3011a.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
901.63	But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .	TS3011a.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[Bluetooth]
929.29	So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look , but take these things into account when you start the discussion .	TS3011a.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
952.07	Yes , so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment , and the way of communicating with these equipments .	TS3011a.C.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[]
1076.59	No , we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device .	TS3011a.C.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1146.35	And um it's very easy for a user to to switch w yes , to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C.D. , on on a chapters , you know , on a D.V.D. player .	TS3011a.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[C.D.]
1266.72	Do do you 	TS3011a.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1320.56	Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago , but I've seem to forget them forgot them .	TS3011a.C.words.xml	seem	[]	[]	[]
319.18	And I will add also that we did that on the uh w the words after filtering them from the removing the the stop words .	IN1016.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1115.9	Link uh 	IN1016.A.words.xml	Link	[]	[]	[]
1283.05	Or maybe we should finish with this first .	IN1016.A.words.xml	finish	[]	[]	[]
2472.22	And we could uh do automatical uh speaker rating if there are good speakers or bad speakers depending if they just read uh 	IN1016.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2795.39	Yeah , aro around February or March .	IN1016.A.words.xml	aro	[around February or March]	[]	[]
2802.9	So to find something for that .	IN1016.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2827.31	But try to finish with the um measures and the call routing .	IN1016.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2832.61	'Cause I was talking with that uh about that to Herve uh since I was uh I will recycle this poster for I.M. two , you know , about uh about this .	IN1016.A.words.xml	recycle	[]	[]	[I.M.]
2843.9	Maybe fuse it with uh Ian's work and uh do a journal paper he was suggesting .	IN1016.A.words.xml	fuse	[]	[]	[Ian]
3261.82	But who really can do uh when somebody will really be able to do that , I mean detect the speech from non-speech , it will be a little revolution , no , in the 	IN1016.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
3384.61	And even uh a first uh uh submission using this work um will make things clearer for me uh writing them down and f for it will help I think for that also .	IN1016.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
3514.77	Yeah and I think uh that will be exactly one hour and uh uh fill the tape .	IN1016.A.words.xml	fill	[]	[]	[]
340.96	dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog .	ES2004a.A.words.xml	som	[]	[]	[]
578.71	One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that .	ES2004a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Euro, Pound]
708.61	Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like 	ES2004a.A.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[wanna]
794.46	Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L.C.D. di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .	ES2004a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
806.03	And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .	ES2004a.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
816.27	You mean to save it lesser number .	ES2004a.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
950.91	It might it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .	ES2004a.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
957.38	But it might have its cost implications .	ES2004a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
403.0	Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .	IS1000b.A.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
554.16	Um , s hang on .	IS1000b.A.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[]
626.82	And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful .	IS1000b.A.words.xml	pay	[]	[]	[]
631.65	Yes , I'll just get this up .	IS1000b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
725.37	This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um .	IS1000b.A.words.xml	pay	[]	[]	[]
770.45	Just follow that link .	IS1000b.A.words.xml	follow	[]	[]	[]
1199.52	So if the b T.V. in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off .	IS1000b.A.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[T.V.]
2013.15	But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote .	IS1000b.A.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
54.34	I'll briefly go through the uh 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
118.18	Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
125.97	Um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
131.94	Um and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you uh um 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
139.47	mm uh use it .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
158.68	uh I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
162.34	Uh before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that um the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
191.49	Um and and then we'll as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out , and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and I uh 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
267.69	Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[teletext]
312.74	But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	introduce	[]	[]	[]
812.14	We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
845.53	Now do we know whether they 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
864.34	That would 've speech recogn right .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	recogn	[]	[]	[]
915.63	It c well it I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I.T.V. and you're watching B.B.C. then then it might um change itself , so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[I.T.V., B.B.C.]
936.19	just to activate it .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	activate	[]	[]	[]
998.02	uh would appear to be essential .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	appear	[]	[]	[]
1009.66	know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey , um 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[grey]
1032.26	Do , please .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
1071.99	print actually print it on the uh 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	print	[]	[]	[]
1093.46	could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1097.76	Anyway , sorry , carry on .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	carry	[]	[]	[]
1099.53	Do you want to just carry on with 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1149.03	S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um 'cause we're 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1492.48	actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the uh such a source , um you know , compromise the our our need for uh you know , it it being 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	compromise	[]	[]	[]
1535.62	but uh uh I think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , you know , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	bite	[]	[]	[]
1556.06	Um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that , but again , except that um you know the risk of losing it .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	end	[]	[]	[]
1810.16	you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's uh , you know never needs replacing .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1818.85	Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , uh um you know , one some sort of typical usage .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1827.1	You know , the the the battery will last 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	last	[]	[]	[]
1829.64	know , five , ten years .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	know	[five ,, ten years]	[]	[]
1842.05	uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1850.88	Yeah , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll give 'em a new one .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1992.9	I would think is 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2025.11	Oh , I must admit I hadn't um I'd I'd missed that .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	admit	[]	[]	[]
2028.26	That does sound excessive .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	sound	[]	[]	[]
2081.13	Um 'cause we're we're getting um right , so I'd I need to sum up very quickly here um .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2221.52	Okay , so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting , thank you very much indeed .	ES2012b.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
249.41	I'll go .	ES2010a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
283.76	Yeah , it does look like a cat .	ES2010a.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
555.25	Yeah , if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A. .	ES2010a.D.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
236.7	Let's say you are doing uh for every twenty millisecond processing one one feature vector .	IN1013.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
512.21	But now what I r really trying to do is somehow approximate that uh carrier signal , to do something with the carrier .	IN1013.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[signal]
566.17	And you can decide how many bands you want more or less .	IN1013.D.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
687.56	You just apply L. L.P. , so auto-correlation let's say , or you can do power spectrum , whatever .	IN1013.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[L., L.P.]
761.98	So you can really use t like in uh L.P.C. system .	IN1013.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[L.P.C.]
766.45	Or you can replace it by some cosine , one cosine generated in a cen centre frequency of that Gaussian window .	IN1013.D.words.xml	replace	[]	[]	[]
951.6	And you can understand pretty well .	IN1013.D.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
954.85	Or if you're adjust uh th find one one line , one speaker and dom dom dominant one in the spectrum of that c uh carrier Hil Hilbert carrier , and you just transmit this parameter .	IN1013.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[Hil, Hilbert]
1039.4	Like great , keep the phase zero and it works .	IN1013.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1096.36	But you just uh get it in in this way , in in the way of Rob's , right .	IN1013.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[Rob]
1100.52	But you can also get the s short time Fourier transform uh and keep it right .	IN1013.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1113.66	And you can put this together , right .	IN1013.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1129.98	But uh you can use it for like two , three kilo-bits per second and it works .	IN1013.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1306.08	You can go down of course .	IN1013.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1389.99	And you are trying to find to uh yeah , to find the harmonics in a temporal domain , right , for that .	IN1013.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1613.7	So we might use this one information for that .	IN1013.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1686.83	Maybe if you we uh really want to improve the the quality , then we will need it , I don't know , still .	IN1013.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1715.13	How does it look like or sure .	IN1013.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1724.73	Let's say amplitude modulation when you have ju just the carrier and that modulation signal , right .	IN1013.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[ju]
1756.01	And well I can again play it and it works on two kilo-bits per second .	IN1013.D.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1832.13	But you can understand well .	IN1013.D.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
1875.38	So before you're applying uh power spectrum , you can again get the you have got a complex f freq frequency or complex spectrum , you can get the phase , right .	IN1013.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1920.93	Re well , you can understand .	IN1013.D.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
1964.4	It's the phase no , you can again put the that envelope with this phase together because envelope is twe 	IN1013.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2239.49	We can do a Hilbert envelope approximation with one second .	IN1013.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Hilbert]
2243.58	But then we can split that signal into , I don't know , ten ten uh segments with the one hundred milliseconds or even less , and we can apply some other technique for that , you know .	IN1013.D.words.xml	split	[]	[]	[]
2441.62	Maybe Hynek will know much more .	IN1013.D.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[Hynek]
2691.77	Like try 	IN1013.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2933.19	Well I can imagine kind of like J. PEG operations , which might be more less like it's source coding and then we also channel coding because we just smooth the or just I don't know .	IN1013.D.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[J., PEG]
221.38	G go on ahead .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
388.63	Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	chat	[]	[]	[]
412.66	Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
539.42	Well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
622.36	Um , uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
645.96	Um okay , if we can move on to next presentation then please .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
651.99	Do you wanna 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1023.45	So want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1125.48	Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , well I don't I'm not really sure how much that will retail at .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[Euro]
1258.5	Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1298.16	Um okay , so um so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition if we can .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1354.16	Uh okay , well do you wanna um give us your presentation and then then we can I don't know um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we're Yeah , exactly , yeah .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1820.02	Okay , so just stick to to regular 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
2007.49	Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2010.27	So um I dunno , just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
2018.37	Um , do you wanna start with David .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[David]
2145.72	Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold , you know , things like that .	ES2002b.B.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
47.87	So just cancel it .	TS3011b.B.words.xml	cancel	[]	[]	[]
243.16	Yeah , I'll start .	TS3011b.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
254.23	Geez , and sli and show .	TS3011b.B.words.xml	sli	[]	[]	[]
357.2	take out , well , eight buttons or so .	TS3011b.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
558.73	Succeed in it also .	TS3011b.B.words.xml	Succeed	[]	[]	[]
626.21	And what's the um if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
819.0	Yeah , well it should just have a design 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
872.51	Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .	TS3011b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
959.44	But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T.V. .	TS3011b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1148.78	We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it .	TS3011b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1289.66	But does it uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , should we just use a 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1577.34	Just elder elder people would would buy it , but 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
2011.74	Well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition .	TS3011b.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2176.88	I'll take the lunch .	TS3011b.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
444.14	Suppose .	EN2001e.E.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
491.23	But I can fit 'em back in if 	EN2001e.E.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1056.39	Uh I'm still in my directory , but I I can put it in your directory .	EN2001e.E.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2941.2	Yeah , I can change that .	EN2001e.E.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
2948.04	Yeah , just to change the index files as well .	EN2001e.E.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
3118.95	Yeah well , we'll work on it , yeah .	EN2001e.E.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
3314.24	Yeah , we could do that .	EN2001e.E.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
3869.36	You could provide that option .	EN2001e.E.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[]
897.9	Let's see .	TS3003a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
983.96	Guess .	TS3003a.B.words.xml	Guess	[]	[]	[]
196.34	I can address some of that issue , I think , with uh my presentation .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	address	[]	[]	[]
303.12	Mine will always read copy of something or other .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
658.99	Uh personal preferences , uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
666.94	Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L.E.D. , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[L.E.D.]
704.8	We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , very specific to the customer .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	offer	[]	[]	[]
720.82	Um certain restrictions do apply here though .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	apply	[]	[]	[]
734.69	Um that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
763.64	Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	utilise	[]	[]	[]
788.75	In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
809.63	So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
813.56	But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	drive	[]	[]	[]
945.28	So that we could reduce cost .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	reduce	[]	[]	[]
1127.38	'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium , make them a rarity so to speak .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	produce	[]	[]	[]
1167.11	Honestly I'd recommend like um uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex , because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	recommend	[]	[]	[]
1182.68	We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so , because this year is all fruit , God only knows why , um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	do	[this year, this year, next year]	[]	[God]
1207.11	They could come back .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1208.98	And buy the extra case .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1214.25	So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1261.41	Well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1475.44	We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[oth]
1509.62	We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1598.72	It'll wear off .	ES2010c.B.words.xml	wear	[]	[]	[]
99.25	I've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me .	IS1008d.C.words.xml	correct	[]	[]	[Christine]
128.67	No it's think it's the last one .	IS1008d.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
151.38	from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour .	IS1008d.C.words.xml	stain	[]	[]	[]
184.71	to unveil our lovely product .	IS1008d.C.words.xml	unveil	[]	[]	[]
261.85	So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control .	IS1008d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
331.32	I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice .	IS1008d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
355.22	So , I mean I can pass this around if anyone wants to 	IS1008d.C.words.xml	pass	[]	[]	[]
894.5	You can do a shipping centre somewhere , or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs .	IS1008d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
918.6	That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , whereas if you're in a store , you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want , whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and 	IS1008d.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1037.25	Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use it's not a trivial task .	IS1008d.C.words.xml	Think	[two weeks]	[]	[]
56.74	So you can um start s checking by y well you you know , you can order it in any way you like , but um start with the first channel and go through it entirely .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
72.7	Um I would recommend , I've found that it's easier when you're checking and you're trying to make sure the boundaries are right for a speech segment , I would recommend , like say this one , go down here to the uh trascription transcription tier and select that it so that uh when you play , you're certain that when it stops , you've caught the whole speech signal for that utterance and haven't lost any signal information .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	recommend	[]	[]	[]
112.49	But um Alternatively , I you you could just listen to the speech segments again and make sure everything is correct for those , and so you could just hit um 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	listen	[]	[]	[]
133.83	And then go back and check the the silence regions .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
138.68	How it if if you wanna make your job a little more interesting , you can d do it in m different ways on a different day .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
186.72	Um and that can be used uh to represent one um unintelligible word or multiple intelligible words , but just use one at symbol .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
223.23	do a search for , yeah , find replace for open parentheses and that'll take you to any that it any that the first transcriber might have marked out .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
236.22	And then you can just resolve those all one by one as as a different set of um changes altogether .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	resolve	[]	[]	[]
248.58	Just once you've gone through um and resolved all the open parentheses , you can do the same for op uh double question marks .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
264.1	If you can um , just give it , you know , give it your best guess in these cases .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
286.41	Yeah , it's I would uh if you're v if you're quite certain , then I would go ahead and um type what you think it was said .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
328.64	So maybe a good idea would be to listen to each channel one by one , do listen to the silent and non-silent regions and make all those corrections , leave the unknowns , the um ambiguities , the uncertainties uncertainties until later .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	listen	[]	[]	[]
346.05	So go through all the channels and do that , and then um then you should have the context from all four speakers , and then go back and do those searches one by one for each channel .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
363.76	You'll you'll know all too well what was said in this meeting by the time you 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
374.7	That would help us um , you know , nab a good number of those uncertainties .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
387.59	Choose one , it c I mean y think of it from a speech recognition point of view again .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	Choose	[]	[]	[]
417.37	Go ahead , go ahead .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
489.5	Um but no , it it can continue into the next segment and that's perfectly fine .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	continue	[]	[]	[]
519.92	I'll review some of these things um after I go through this a bit um just to re-cap .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	review	[]	[]	[]
537.49	So I'll go over those t as an opportunity to use the white-board .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
621.96	So I would I would keep that .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
671.28	Try to get it right .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
688.07	I mean I I I'd you know , it's unfortunate for him and for us 'cause it's really gonna be a nightmare to transcribe .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
696.34	So you will have to draw the line somewhere .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
740.06	Make your best guess .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
741.78	Try to listen to it carefully enough , but not not so that you're obsessing over it for too long .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
918.64	Yeah , I I've I remember that .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
920.52	That one I would I would flag , just like you did .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	flag	[]	[]	[]
972.99	So oop , I lost my lapel lapel mic .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	oop	[]	[]	[]
980.35	Wait .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
1005.92	So just really keep an ear out for those .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1026.29	But um this this second pass we should really try to catch all of them or at least most of th yeah .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1078.63	So yeah , y if you do see um something like um U.H.M. for um , you you would change that to the regularised v version .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[U.H.M.]
1187.37	Let me see .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1291.35	If you have any questions about spellings , I i I think I m might have sent an email to this effect , just check the Oxford English Dictionary online .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[Oxford, English, Dictionary]
1317.91	You could take this as an Emacs file and run a spell check on it .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[Emacs]
1362.98	So we'll we will just hope that you catch it .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	hope	[]	[]	[]
1418.02	Let me save that .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1466.29	Then use um 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1474.19	I'd have to hear it , because it m sounds like it could be a fragment .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1479.27	Uh it ju I'd just have to hear it .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1490.79	but I I I do know the type of scenario you're describing .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1577.22	If you hear just laughter on either side , yeah , do that .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1597.43	I'll f I'll talk to Melissa and Jean .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[Melissa, Jean]
1625.79	I'll figure that one out and put it up on the wiki or email you .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
1649.09	Um we can skip on .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
1727.6	Um y that may be , but I probably would flag it .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	flag	[]	[]	[]
1816.84	Yeah , I would type it as two .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	type	[]	[]	[]
1888.32	And Maarika asked me what to do in the case of an utterance just consisting of laughter , do we do we use punctuation in these cases , and I don't know .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	use	[]	[Maarika]	[]
1950.66	So like I said , click down here just to if you haven't learned that trick already .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
2031.1	Yeah , we can just wipe them out in one fell swoop .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	wipe	[]	[]	[]
2053.26	They will I th they'll help in the case of discourse marking , but his point was that they're really subjective , I mean something that you the transcriber here Yeah , yeah .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
2164.38	The but this being a head-set mic channel m may make it easier to hear .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2206.72	And so you'll f probably find yourself turning the volume down considerably .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2213.68	But let us know , because we can retrieve the the other files .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	retrieve	[]	[]	[]
2305.7	I d I did see s I've been looking at some guidelines for another corpus and I did see something about proper names , so I'll I'll have a look at that and see how we can handle that here .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2348.91	But but there shou we should also have a w a means of dealing with proper names when we don't know what it is or how it might be spelled at all and and flagging that in in some way .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2453.26	If you if if f it's a foreign word and you know what it is , just enclose it in carets .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	enclose	[]	[]	[]
2526.79	So we will catch these things 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	catch	[]	[]	[]
2586.61	Then check the speech regions .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
2608.16	Um transcribe 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	transcribe	[]	[]	[]
2633.87	Look for missed punctuation , 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
2679.44	Try to get f false starts .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
2686.98	Short words , make sure with little words like the and uh , little articles and that kind of thing don't get omitted .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2707.57	And then um look for cases of mis-transcription 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2718.81	But anyway , Mis-transcription , so make sure if the speaker said will , you type will not would or um if they say we , even though it might be more grammatically correct to type we're , um that kind of thing .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2752.95	Um , use the O.E.D. to check on things you don't know about .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2757.55	Um refer to the wiki for all regularised spellings and f for things like filled pauses .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	refer	[]	[]	[]
2776.92	And then , yeah , capitalise the K. .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	capitalise	[]	[]	[K.]
2795.52	What else did I find .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2797.36	Um the so make sure the da the dash , the hyphen , whatever you call it , is being used appropriately in cases of discontinuity , um but not in stuttering , like I said .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2855.42	I would just try to keep segments very manageable um and a but u you know , use these wave-forms to help you .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2864.12	And you can adjust the resolution so that Oh .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	adjust	[]	[]	[]
2940.81	Yeah , so to help you make cuts , just look look f you know , use this wave-form and make sure you're not l losing any signal information .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
2949.24	But um cutting segments down is a l a low priority , but it it will help ultimately , I think , post-processing wise .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
3038.36	Scroll down , you'll see w all the files .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	Scroll	[]	[]	[]
3046.53	So if you run out of work , go ahead and start checking , because this is something that's um considerably um bottle-necked at the moment .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
3088.37	Just keep it the same .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
3108.27	But they're they're creating a their a guy Jonathan is creating a web form for you to do this all very simply and like just um upload everything that you've uh up upload the file that you've transcribed and and you'll be noting whether it's the first pass or the second pass and y your name um as the person who did that particular pass .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	upload	[]	[]	[Jonathan]
3129.89	And that will happen soon .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	happen	[]	[]	[]
3137.57	Yeah , you'll have to I would suggest creating a f folder um called files to be checked or something like that .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3146.2	Yeah , and then within that create a s create sub-folders for the the given meeting and you'll have to get all the sound files unfortunately from the M.M.M. server on your own , because the the AMI server's not very reliable for getting these sound files uncorrupted .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[M.M.M., AMI]
3167.59	So you'll have to get all the sound files from the M.M.M. server and the person's transcription file should be in that folder where you're putting yours .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[M.M.M.]
3175.81	Um and then you'll just uh yeah d you'll copy that over , you won't don't move it over , because we wanna have multiple versions of these things , but yeah , copy it into your directory and keep the same name .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	copy	[]	[]	[]
3191.4	And then when you check it in , it will automatically be registered even though the the first pass was checked in when we're doing this checking in business , um it will know which pass it is , but I think you'll also be indicating that as well .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
3268.44	I should think so .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
3269.4	I mean the whole point w of keeping well , as long as you're able to , yeah , work out use of your computer with the other person , that's fine , yeah .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
3385.6	Talk to Caroline .	EN2004a.B.words.xml	Talk	[]	[]	[Caroline]
884.81	I will look to have a connection .	IN1001.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1163.84	Understand .	IN1001.C.words.xml	Understand	[]	[]	[]
1383.3	Uh I have look at the demo film , and it's about uh 	IN1001.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1456.57	Okay , understand .	IN1001.C.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
2167.09	Okay , understand .	IN1001.C.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
2183.78	So for example you can change you can change a number to take which one , okay .	IN1001.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
2190.63	Okay , understand .	IN1001.C.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
2293.03	Okay , understand .	IN1001.C.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
2303.48	Yes , understand .	IN1001.C.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
2416.08	Yeah , understand .	IN1001.C.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
2501.8	To make 	IN1001.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2557.66	Work in progress .	IN1001.C.words.xml	Work	[]	[]	[]
2617.19	From outside of IDIAP we can access this .	IN1001.C.words.xml	access	[]	[]	[IDIAP]
2860.45	So we can forget tosh and uh use uh input se the input reader for the the M. PEG we can re lo use uh open C.V. .	IN1001.C.words.xml	forget	[]	[C.V.]	[M., PEG, lo]
2940.47	We can skip some frames .	IN1001.C.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
3113.57	So I will ask you or someone else , okay .	IN1001.C.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
3121.04	Okay , okay , understand .	IN1001.C.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
21.68	Forget every time that the 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	Forget	[]	[]	[]
67.34	Keep an eye if I'm dropping this 'cause just seem ah , as I said , it doesn't seem very s Perhaps sweater , or maybe if I set it here on the this brand thing .	EN2002d.A.words.xml	Keep	[]	[]	[]
194.8	You could change your project .	EN2002d.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
197.03	Do a P.H.D. or uh yeah .	EN2002d.A.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
357.39	I'll do it .	EN2002d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
954.57	We have to remember to include that in our evaluation , how they did the GIF improve your browsing experie 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	improve	[]	[]	[GIF, experie]
1040.86	Yeah we'll think about that .	EN2002d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1059.67	I can send you right now .	EN2002d.A.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1222.12	we'll try and do Monday .	EN2002d.A.words.xml	try	[Monday]	[]	[]
1432.02	Can have a look .	EN2002d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1642.52	We could p probably just expand that .	EN2002d.A.words.xml	expand	[]	[]	[]
1652.29	And then I mean write about the evala evaluation and stuff .	EN2002d.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[evala]
2003.07	Excuse me .	EN2002d.A.words.xml	Excuse	[]	[]	[]
2024.66	To have for the start-up .	EN2002d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2026.81	To have for the start-up .	EN2002d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2054.38	Yeah g uh that was li like yeah , if I'll make a just index 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[li]
2190.12	We can just email if we need other 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	email	[]	[]	[]
139.26	Uh , b Let me see it .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
260.45	Um and then uh we'll send it to you and you can do the final revisions .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
393.84	We would prefer to concentrate on the main 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
412.52	M m meet these milestones at Yeah .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
417.58	Like , you know , develop prototype GUI .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	develop	[]	[]	[GUI]
483.21	I I really wanna do it .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
501.3	Yeah , it might turn out easier than thought .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
537.74	We should probably d sorry , we should probably do another responsibility of packages as well .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
557.64	Well you could put , you know yeah , I don't know .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
932.13	I mean we could we could order them by meeting , for example .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	order	[]	[]	[]
938.46	How to order it .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	order	[]	[]	[]
944.97	How do we wanna order them in the first place .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	order	[]	[]	[]
957.25	Yeah , maybe we should do that .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1015.61	If you if you do it straight from you know , you get th you get the result , and then there's some if statement saying s straight on the , you know , rock bottom lev level saying if th if you found a segment , then colour it print it in red or whatever , and 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	colour	[]	[]	[]
1042.04	Well , have a look .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1053.36	Yeah , yeah , I can imagine .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1128.78	As I said , you know , if you if you left-click on something for example , it highlights automatically .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1244.86	We'll just put an if loop in it that leaves out some of the print statements .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1344.16	You could nearly do it together with with uh the transcription with the original transcription , have them run parallel .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1351.86	So if certain , you know if it's a proper word , print it on both both panes , and if it's not a proper word , then print it only on one .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	print	[]	[]	[]
1385.99	So But I mean you can , you know , you can write we can write something like um we'll try and do it on the fly and and observe if if that gonna is gonna take too long .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1395.83	If it's gonna take too long , we'll think about writing it to a file and doing it off-line .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1617.99	Maybe you could split that up and 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	split	[]	[]	[]
1730.65	And then send it on to us so we can nod .	EN2002b.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
5.4	Look at all this stuff man .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
234.62	Add more buttons .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	Add	[]	[]	[]
239.28	Well in uh I guess in in In meeting browser one point one , you can have a menu instead of a button but this why I don't think it Yeah .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
287.89	Get to use my pen .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	Get	[]	[]	[]
471.16	Do you mean 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
505.74	You , oh go away .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
507.17	Stop coming up .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	Stop	[]	[]	[]
565.81	Probably not , but we might need them for disfluencies , if we try do it in audio .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
577.91	We might want to be able to say oh , just give me what that person's saying .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
730.95	'Cause otherwise Photoshop has a lot of windows , if you ever use Photoshop it's got loads , and you're always g forever going no , get out of the way .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[Photoshop]
905.04	You can make it if you make it world readable , then anybody can access it .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1089.07	And I can get rid of it , but I'm having trouble putting it anywhere else .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1092.3	So it will come up on the screen For the moment I haven't managed to put it into a vector or whatever in Java to play with it .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[Java]
1148.9	Should share as much as possible .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	share	[]	[]	[]
1180.27	The the the week as it as is rather than the proper week , do you know what I mean .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	know	[The the the week]	[]	[]
1183.67	Do you know that , it's been all a bit manic , the last m the last yeah .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1306.98	Four , and it w it li it just has an open variable transparent s list , whatever , find everything that's got that and then load 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1391.33	Fish the data , I was just thinking that , yeah .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	Fish	[]	[]	[]
1436.89	Commen commenting it out one bit at a time and running it , does it work , yeah .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[Commen]
1440.45	Okay , get rid of that , next .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1469.91	Well , should you find you want to explore any other perhaps you as your um uh quantify raising .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1823.06	Can take us for a tutorial sometime .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1920.89	Well if you find me , I'll show you where I'll I'll let us all in there , and we can all go in there .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
1927.91	You do need to have a key for it .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1932.21	Yeah , somebody will answer it .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	answer	[]	[]	[]
2034.37	Nah , make 'em work .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Nah]
2127.04	Log off .	EN2002a.D.words.xml	Log	[]	[]	[]
50.51	So I think it's better to first have a presentation of my work and then we can discuss uh with this crash in temp in temp uh what we can do uh for my future to to continue my research , because apparently I I will have serious problems , okay .	IN1002.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
70.86	So I will start with the presentation of my work .	IN1002.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
274.27	Um the the difference is that we do one more step , uh maybe I can explain it better there .	IN1002.B.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
384.76	So as you see , introducing more reasonable prior knowledge um will h help to have better performance in almo in almost all the cases .	IN1002.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
453.96	So if you want now we can discuss about um uh the crash and the loss of data , so uh well I lost all the posteriors I was I uh I used as input uh for my system , so the gamma are somehow estimated or computed on top of posteriors .	IN1002.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
606.1	Yeah , b well , even they can have some information which are not so meaningful or uh which are not related .	IN1002.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
614.11	Yeah well , but then I will have the problem to find the optimum amount of context .	IN1002.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1080.35	Well , I also had the of generated posteriors or gammas or things like this , which I should regenerate , I have the uh scripts but uh well it takes time , it's C.P.U. and regenerating all these things , but okay , it's okay .	IN1002.B.words.xml	regenerate	[]	[]	[C.P.U.]
1637.04	Well uh P.L.P.s I think th they should be first regenerated , then posteriors , and if by the end of week we could have posteriors , then it's not that difficult , I can easily regenerate the gammas and do all the experiments again .	IN1002.B.words.xml	have	[the end of week]	[]	[]
1777.9	Uh will I I will explain .	IN1002.B.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
1816.97	So then uh for now I think it's better to instead of doing P.L.P. and delta P.L.P. , I can uh have single stream of thirty nine P.L.P.s , and then combine them with traps , just to have 	IN1002.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[P.L.P., delta, P.L.P.]
1854.18	But just to make things clear in the presentation , to show more steps 	IN1002.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1861.72	Try yeah .	IN1002.B.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
2058.66	And what if we have some day a fire in IDIAP , we will lose all the data .	IN1002.B.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[IDIAP]
2065.63	Mm I mean , but they have well I I think w they can and yeah , they can d you know , store it somewhere .	IN1002.B.words.xml	store	[]	[]	[]
2076.4	But you know , here we can easily have a fire , because the everything is made of wood I think and it's small and 	IN1002.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
218.12	And they all they're two different objects , and you can recall they can write the it writes the objects and then you call the objects back and they ha those returned objects have all the information that they need , and then you can call methods to return whatever you want .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	recall	[]	[]	[]
254.63	And then or just call them one at a time to populate window .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
257.34	But that's what I wanted to how y how what format do you want the data to come back in .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
261.49	'Cause it can come back as a almost anything .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
291.03	So um so I can have it so that it returns you a 'cause at the moment the main data structures are hash tables for the meetings that say it's got one that says percent it's called percent talk .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
316.96	So it can either come back as a you can have the hash table or you can have it returned as a vector , and it will say noise .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
329.77	W you can either have it th you could either have it you could i have it like an embedded in vector or array of strings and each one represents one person or whatever .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
389.41	Just spend too much time talking to Brits .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[Brits]
393.81	, where did these people come from .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
435.46	So that's and it says like get get talk time , and you and y it takes a name , so that w could call that would call that and call the meetings method that said return that , and that would populate that , which should be an easy thing to do .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
472.39	So I'll w I'll just leave in lots of methods that st that'll just return one number at a time .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[st]
528.05	Go through a list .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
543.56	It's just tell it tells you who participated .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
567.95	No , topic specified , yeah have a default , yeah .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
590.29	And then you could do a search over the meetings over the objects .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
593.46	'Cause that's the thing , these these are so small , they can load each o all of the whole lot up and do a search of the whole lot to find who by who and what problem or what topics were in what .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
642.79	Mm no , design the GUI first , and uh 'cause it it w the problem is if you change the classes , it the object's serial numbers change and you can't re-load the object , so all the processing has to be done over again .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[Mm, GUI]
656.05	It would become out of synch and get a bit funny .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
667.87	And you'd have to and then you'd have a v multiple copies of objects all over the place and it'd get silly , I think .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
676.37	But if you can if you wanna make the picture c you can do that without anything , I'm presuming .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
712.12	When it's finished up global , otherwise it would get confusing .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
894.44	It it's a bit dumb , if you can fool it , if you c if you c load up ten different si engines simultaneously , it can do that fine .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	fool	[]	[]	[]
925.82	Say nice machine , it goes 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
1023.81	Load me a meeting , load me a search , load me something else .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	Load	[]	[]	[]
1027.17	Whistle a tune .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	Whistle	[]	[]	[]
1093.68	It has to be an observation , and even if you go and se you can go and search the whole corpus from that , but you have to have it has to start with something for some bizarre reason .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1182.93	You can load a dumb one up that doesn't have any 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
1212.55	'Cause otherwise you'll crash the thing .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	crash	[]	[]	[]
1302.71	Ma make it strings for as long as possible , and then only return the things when they actually needs to has to search .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	return	[]	[]	[Ma]
1322.45	Did we think about um 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1347.93	We'll just use that then .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1390.58	Yeah , to do um what Steve's talking about you do .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Steve]
1393.44	To do the topic labelling .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1504.29	I did do it once , I do have a Java class that does it for something , I don't know whether it'll work with this .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Java]
1534.54	Instead uh it would just search for key-words when it when they you tell him that with topics , but actually get searching with key-words .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	search	[]	[]	[]
1579.73	No , you can do you can do search without T.F.I.D.F. , you just can't rank the search .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[T.F.I.D.F.]
1647.26	Well it'd just give you a rank .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1703.03	in its most simple form it would do a separate rank for each one , each term .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1707.74	You could make it more complicated and make it do for th for the yeah .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1715.23	You can just add 'em up , or you can 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1732.24	I guess you just do a sum of the um of the the individual T.F.I.D.F. for each term returned , and that generally will be a bit crude , but it will give you a d score , and the higher the more uh more informative each term is for each thing would give you a 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[T.F.I.D.F.]
1978.8	Uh you can have a save preferences .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1980.7	You could have a save preferenc preferences , I guess .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1987.95	Well alright , call it favourites then .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
1993.38	You can have a favourites .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2080.96	Or search , yeah , yeah .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	search	[]	[]	[]
2125.16	Or or the search but the search window could have on it something that said just has a drop down menu that says just and a go button that said take me to this .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2146.15	It's just all here , and here is just go to wherever and a go button .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2211.65	Or and you can choose , you can go go for go or go for the other .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
2214.15	Go on go for both .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
2233.7	We could do Microsoft stylie and hold it over and it pops up a thing .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Microsoft]
2279.42	Go .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
2280.29	Find me .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	Find	[]	[]	[]
2281.12	Find me , then then then it pulls up a list of all the ones who got that user in it .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	Find	[]	[]	[]
2286.99	Maybe just leave it , just have them there , and don't worry about the speakers .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
2301.47	Or you can have a f text box there that's got yeah , as you go over them .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2330.13	We can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near loading up a 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2436.95	Yeah , I should have more to talk about .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2505.18	Should we say three o'clock and then if there's a v serious problem , I'll tell you .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
2568.98	Then we'd know who's missed them or who's if we've done any .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
2684.26	Yeah , that would help a lot for that s for single terms it would be very useful .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
2697.67	Or you could do it and override it by the you ca you could just ignore the d ranking if it doesn't show up together .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2706.31	Or you could perhap you could penalize it , you could just put a b weight against it .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	perhap	[]	[]	[]
2714.46	Either disregard it or put a weighting against it .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	disregard	[]	[]	[]
2729.81	Yeah , might have to talk to Pernilla about that .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Pernilla]
2745.39	And if the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom when it was actually the most relevant one , something like that would just push it up .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
2779.42	If you just dup add them together .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
2823.99	How do you rank them or something .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	rank	[]	[]	[]
2834.41	Look through them all , yeah .	EN2002c.B.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
610.38	They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , so , and chew 'em up .	IS1008c.D.words.xml	chew	[]	[]	[]
615.35	And chew 'em up .	IS1008c.D.words.xml	chew	[]	[]	[]
941.01	If you can find me , where I'm at .	IS1008c.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1083.82	So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , 	IS1008c.D.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
1169.24	Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions , millions .	IS1008c.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1254.2	come up with a nice product .	IS1008c.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1371.56	I will market it .	IS1008c.D.words.xml	market	[]	[]	[]
1374.14	Once we get a price on it then we can market it .	IS1008c.D.words.xml	market	[]	[]	[]
86.4	Look's good .	EN2001b.D.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
224.68	Yes , we can do that .	EN2001b.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
258.03	Well , I could give you an I.D. , but it'd be quite difficult to actually give a topic a title .	EN2001b.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[I.D.]
763.62	Yeah , think so .	EN2001b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2075.88	Well , um when it splits the topics up , it does do it on regular words that um that occur .	EN2001b.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
3324.08	Yeah , just send us an email and tell us what's happening .	EN2001b.D.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
807.15	Uh , can you go on to the next slide , please .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
864.44	Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
883.48	Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should uh be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
956.28	Then also we can If it is a rechargeable one , then uh people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut cut the cost , but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
972.15	Can you go to the next slide , please .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
987.14	Uh when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1006.04	Suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
1021.81	Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L.E.D. which translates the signal into infrared light .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[butto, button, L.E.D.]
1054.49	It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L.E.D. and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	amplify	[]	[]	[L.E.D.]
1078.71	Then it will do the appropriate action .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1086.08	Can you go to the next slide , please .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1162.37	Can you go go on to the next slide .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1175.06	Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper , because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires , it's it's better to go for printing , because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing , nothing like uh , you know , you don't need to use wires and all .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
1201.32	Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	acti	[]	[]	[Tha]
1229.29	Can you go to the next slide , please .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1279.68	So that also we can have in a battery , uh or we can use solar sells .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1312.14	Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we can't use .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[ma]
1318.05	Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print , um also infra it includes the infrared se sender .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1329.75	Um yeah the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	develop	[]	[]	[]
1353.52	No , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	go	[ten ten years]	[]	[]
1588.75	So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think .	IS1009c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
68.59	It looks like basically less than n th their stuff , but actually Dave has written a whole underlying different structure now and if we hooked it up with my display , then we should fairly easily from now get to a stage where we can like select individual segments and click on them , then play that part in a compressed way and display density information .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[Dave]
157.68	So just to show , Dave has put a uh music file in there , and the music file is playing without gaps .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[Dave]
214.64	Um shall I just load it with Jasmine's data , just to see a different Where's the 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[Jasmine]
319.46	Well wha wha what what's the differe so th this is reall 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[]
343.22	Maybe have to find out where .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
450.11	And and then make selections based on a segment .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
482.32	So it should always , whatever , reduce it to half the original 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	reduce	[]	[]	[]
512.94	But that's sort of that gives people a bit less control over so maybe we should do it instead that it yeah , it c it you can spec 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
573.22	Shall we abandon the whole notion of seeing the whole m one whole group as one single thing and just work on a p certainly from now on probably for good that means .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	abandon	[]	[]	[]
707.91	Uh , think we should just make sure that if it takes quite some time that that the clock doesn't start before or that the audio and the clock are in synch sort of .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
763.76	See there's there's one week after my dissertation .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	See	[one week]	[]	[]
769.52	Which I can work a lot lot lot on this .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
801.22	Yeah , well the graphic display will definitely have more information .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
819.5	Or do you think it will , I mean do you thi like 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
974.98	Like if we do a s like a similarity search , and just like you say find me similar segments and then sort of like you have a list and you click on one of them and then you go to that segment , I think that's quite useful um even without displaying them sort of dis-continuously .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1001.57	We should aim to get some names for segments , like just some extraction of something that we can call .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	aim	[]	[]	[]
1030.49	And then we could like we could sort of use the same thing for um yours and mine .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1035.89	Because yours would sort of give just the segment I.D.s and mine would give the start segment I.D.s .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[segment, I.D.s, I.D.s]
1045.18	So basically this display would have information about a segment where something starts .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1084.6	And in my case it would say some name for the segment , and then you would just click on it and then like the whole thing would kick in .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1183.09	So what about a general layout like this that we have here , the dialogue acts and there the player b And here we'd have a search button and the similarity thing button .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1221.61	Alternatively we'll have like the whole thing running already when we do the presentation and we just arrange it manually .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1481.94	Well alternatively we could always have sort of a third small component , whatever , like if this was the search results , and then they are just like something else that's part unwritten when Miles goes over this one it triggers that one to display it or something .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Miles]
1510.73	But we'll we can try that .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1534.87	Yeah yeah , we will have .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1544.14	Um the thing I remember , like I have to find out how to do it without redrawing the display each time , because the display at the moment does take , you see , like it takes a fraction of a segment to display , but probably too much to update it to completely repaint the whole thing every second .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1890.91	So Jasmine , if if you got something like this and like this for for your current data , would that help in 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[Jasmine]
1923.14	Can probably add a open file dialogue box with minimum effort because I think it's a ready-made component that returns a string for a file name .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1968.49	'Cause then we can just publish a script that you just run and then this whole thing starts .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	publish	[]	[]	[]
2057.95	Where do you think you can uh produce something like that .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2231.34	I b like would just I would find logical reasons for why you can sugg say peop 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[peop]
2405.7	Does anyone have a good idea like at the moment to play around with it , what's a good way of displaying two types of information in the in the colour display .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2423.49	Because then we could do Jasmine's and and Vera's probably in the same scale .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Jasmine, Vera]
2456.98	We should assume a n assume a non-linguistic user .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	assume	[]	[]	[]
2465.96	Yeah , so um I'll try the red green blue .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[blue]
2469.57	Wha what's does anyone know what this hue and saturation thing , like what that no , nobody's done much colour work .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[Wha]
2490.04	Okay , well I guess I'll just take a look at the Photoshop colour cube or whatever it is , GIMP colour cube , and look at 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[Photoshop, GIMP]
2523.55	And and then you'll get this type of display with that file .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2729.94	Like you y there would only be one version of your data , and you can just override that version if you want .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	override	[]	[]	[]
2761.91	Okay , but like so make it an option which one it displays or which one it uses for the summarisation or 'cause it 'cause I was just thinking sort of so that both Jasmine and Vera could um see their data working and 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Jasmine, Vera]
2798.33	So we would have like each of those components for 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2930.08	Or maybe just start with just two like without even combining them in any sophisticated way .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
2986.69	But then also we'd have to find more sophisticated ways of loading it , specifying the parameters .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3015.29	But it might actu I think it might not really be worth it to be honest .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	actu	[]	[]	[]
3025.06	Let's work on the other stuff first , like the other stuff , and just provide like something where each of them just if if there's uh a Jasmine script and a Vera script and they each can load their stuff and see their data in in the thing .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[Jasmine, Vera]
3053.44	And yeah , and then they can tune , fine-tune their measures .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	tune	[]	[]	[]
3103.02	Or like the rate is probably a property , which in the worst case we'd have to set public , but if we wanna react to it being changed automatically , we might have to .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3163.83	And we could justify all sorts of stuff like that by r in the presentation by saying we deliberately tried to keep any complexity and numbers and stuff away from people .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	justify	[]	[]	[]
3280.25	'Kay listen , so why don't we meet after three then , because then I can like until three make sure that I have all the display c 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	listen	[]	[]	[Kay]
3290.7	S oh so we could meet at five and I have the display code ready by then , which does the stuff like like having a bar where the position is and stuff .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
3323.58	Yeah , so we can meet in five in Apple at five in Appleton tower and just work on so I'll I'll have my displ I'll make sure that my display does all the stuff we've been talking about un until then .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	meet	[]	[Appleton]	[Apple, un]
3336.71	And then we'll put those things together .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
3356.16	But I mean like we we should discuss together which w like how the the search interacts with the rest .	EN2001d.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
459.88	See if we have to put on some restraints .	EN2003a.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
473.46	Let's see .	EN2003a.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
999.66	Um write into the call that we are considering the idea of having a poster session .	EN2003a.C.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1009.83	So people can indicate would they prefer to give a poster or a talk .	EN2003a.C.words.xml	indicate	[]	[]	[]
1015.14	But the ultimate decision is on our side because we have to see how it does it work out with the poster session , how does it work out with the talks .	EN2003a.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1070.51	throw a general suggestion at them .	EN2003a.C.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
1072.24	See what happens .	EN2003a.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1200.51	Read something recently about 	EN2003a.C.words.xml	Read	[]	[]	[]
1425.53	Adjust .	EN2003a.C.words.xml	Adjust	[]	[]	[]
1651.9	to get the stuff done .	EN2003a.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1899.44	I could create us another calendar .	EN2003a.C.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
876.62	I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	finalise	[]	[]	[]
889.2	We can wind up .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	wind	[]	[]	[]
893.17	Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
946.58	Of course in that we could put L.C.D. or recognition to be more technologically innovative .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
972.66	Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	find	[the this year, an year]	[Paris, Milan]	[]
1069.99	from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1085.69	if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1098.81	We can make our study on this and 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1279.23	No actually uh to make it with L.C.D. you make more efforts .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1420.93	Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1428.6	So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L.C.D. and without speech recognition .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	amend	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1554.0	If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1576.74	Yeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	hide	[]	[]	[]
1593.08	In the same set , yeah , and and individual buttons to make them work .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1670.83	But you can make it on a single P.C. with three different options .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[P.C.]	[]
1703.33	I mean you could just provide with an optional .	IS1007d.D.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[]
1747.33	Do you require different types of P.C.B.s and 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	require	[]	[]	[P.C.B.s]
143.1	So in t twenty minutes you can see at least two , three posters , and you can directly talk to people , so .	IN1012.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
390.91	So you can go to the direct uh ce central place and then occas uh .	IN1012.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
403.91	Yeah , da 	IN1012.A.words.xml	da	[]	[]	[]
409.94	Uh what is the place , uh the the central I mean where we change the bus to yeah , in the yeah , maybe you can check the booklet .	IN1012.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
502.39	So did they reduce it's in between the direct covariance this is full covariance .	IN1012.A.words.xml	reduce	[]	[]	[]
507.97	Should try to reduce some parameters by tying .	IN1012.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
610.76	It's really computationally really uh yeah so see suppose if thirty nine in te thirty nine to thirty nine for every yeah , yeah , so 	IN1012.A.words.xml	suppose	[]	[]	[]
689.21	Speak uh yeah , different task and 	IN1012.A.words.xml	Speak	[]	[]	[]
742.6	Yeah mm mm you can do like you can measure and you can do but he's mm basically doing some mm likelihood ratio testing .	IN1012.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
800.88	No , you can use mol yeah .	IN1012.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[mol]
919.25	So this shift will suppose if you find one segment of sixty milliseconds , and then you're doing this ten millisecond so every almost I think yeah , mm uh yeah , five frames y you're analysing the previ this already segment so .	IN1012.A.words.xml	suppose	[]	[]	[]
934.11	So again , this may blur some frequency transitions or yeah , but the problem is again this uh bottleneck is here , like you can't change your Nyquist frequency modulation and 	IN1012.A.words.xml	blur	[]	[]	[]
1029.65	Yeah , then he can split that window at point N. say point N. , so then you will have gyro two no , you can segment it maybe .	IN1012.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[N., N.]
1049.33	So then you can move your like this .	IN1012.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
1052.25	You can move your point , so that then this will be like one and this will be second .	IN1012.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
1138.87	Then there would be suppose this point is say N. .	IN1012.A.words.xml	suppose	[]	[]	[N.]
1178.37	So residual power he can compare t so he after do after doing L.P. he can get a l residual and then he can compare the power of the residual .	IN1012.A.words.xml	compare	[]	[]	[L.P.]
1467.04	No no , wait .	IN1012.A.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1468.3	No , he will get like every ten milliseconds he get one fra one features , like he it doesn't really depend , because suppose if you take your t case , like you your window i maybe longer , so doesn't really matter like how what size window you use or not .	IN1012.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1641.32	Stationality is this is optimation , we want to like see some signal , few segments , which can really represent whole , so maybe that's why like this may not be really 	IN1012.A.words.xml	represent	[]	[]	[]
1741.13	Yeah , especially features , like suppose if somebody come with different good features , again people st again use M.F.C.C.s 	IN1012.A.words.xml	suppose	[]	[]	[st, M.F.C.C.s]
1920.43	At the end then they will ask you to synthesise some sentence and you have to synthesise them and then you have to send them 	IN1012.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1939.63	Yeah , listen and yeah d yeah , even uh they it's mostly they use native speakers only , because they can really judge well , so .	IN1012.A.words.xml	listen	[]	[]	[]
1985.73	Text to speech .	IN1012.A.words.xml	speech	[]	[]	[]
2103.26	But it's better , like once you have like whatever the back end , then you can put features like whether they're gammas or like spectral entropies or M.F.C.C.s or whatever .	IN1012.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[gammas]
2165.01	Yeah , at least I mean wha those studies I think people already did for even in I.C. I.C.S.L.P. two thousand two there is special session on features for Aurora , so yeah , yeah , i yeah yeah .	IN1012.A.words.xml	wha	[two thousand two]	[I.C.]	[I.C.S.L.P., Aurora]
2244.92	What kind of features do you use , like do you use um any you don't yeah , you don't 	IN1012.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2270.78	But do you have any like feeling that whether they go for all these new features or they usually use only mm .	IN1012.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[mm]
2574.88	Ah , ok yeah , definitely they may charge for more money f again , some extra bill for this using this recognition engine or something .	IN1012.A.words.xml	charge	[]	[]	[]
2676.72	Yeah yeah , you can listen Festival .	IN1012.A.words.xml	listen	[]	[]	[Festival]
2681.57	Read the like 	IN1012.A.words.xml	Read	[]	[]	[]
2689.81	Yeah yeah , Fes yeah , I think I think you can do the Festival , you can just call like uh this there are different kind of again , how you call the Festival , so you can just give the full there is an too .	IN1012.A.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[Fes, Festival, Festival]
2702.37	So then you will get the all the caller and other things .	IN1012.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2705.6	If if you want to like read full text , then you can say like the full text , like those syntax and then it will speak till it finishes the text .	IN1012.A.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
2719.85	That's why it's real time , like otherwise it's bit difficult and it's okay , you can easily understand , so it's intelligible , so .	IN1012.A.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
2821.3	So maybe you can just check no , i it's it's here on the web , then it won't come with your Linux software , so you have to again download from uh their web page .	IN1012.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[Linux]
2832.68	Yeah , you can download , now .	IN1012.A.words.xml	download	[]	[]	[]
2841.14	So you can download from the voice from the web Festival .	IN1012.A.words.xml	download	[]	[]	[Festival]
2870.91	But you can prune like how much you want , because 	IN1012.A.words.xml	prune	[]	[]	[]
2884.55	So you can you can always optimise , you can put some thresholds and pruning and then you can make it real time .	IN1012.A.words.xml	optimise	[]	[]	[]
2894.98	Th you can just check Multisyn and then voices .	IN1012.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[Multisyn]
2949.69	But those things you can add , like if you're really familiar with Festival , so you can add always these 	IN1012.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[Festival]
348.81	Just the look like , the button part I'll explain .	IS1009d.B.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
570.45	It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a 	IS1009d.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
621.2	give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective .	IS1009d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
714.08	Scroll up or scroll down the channels .	IS1009d.B.words.xml	Scroll	[]	[]	[]
733.84	Yes , it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols .	IS1009d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1019.3	Yes d we do have special form .	IS1009d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1553.05	I'll give three .	IS1009d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1655.36	We can always improve , yes .	IS1009d.B.words.xml	improve	[]	[]	[]
271.44	Then uh I w I will uh give a very uh rough plan for the next uh couple of month .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
283.35	And finally I I will intr i introduce some related work , yeah .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	intr	[]	[]	[]
489.43	So if speak changes .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
521.74	So for that part uh for that kind of back-channels we can just skip that and uh uh to not treat them as interruptions or something like .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
625.01	If we go further , we might distinguish uh the interactivity between two , f three , or all the groups .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	distinguish	[]	[]	[]
721.02	We might um yeah need a more strict or finer uh definition of interactivity .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1494.65	If we need more then we might use some more finer uh f finer uh definition for interactivity .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1642.21	but uh in these two strands or work they uh just come up with a list , maybe not uh exhaustive .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1789.22	But uh uh for the uh opinion or thought uh stuff , then the speaker might just uh uh present some idea and others will comment or uh challenge uh the idea .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[]
2129.01	A and also s in 'cause in the meetings uh the speakers might might report something uh they've done in the past and uh uh uh uh talk about th what they are currently doing and also planning some future actions .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	report	[]	[]	[]
2457.75	So we're going to do something and uh uh so could you do something or this kind of uh action related utterance I mean .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2487.35	Before come up with the scheme , you mean .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
2575.17	Y yeah , look uh not very much detail , yeah .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
3045.57	So uh so we we might ju first try a few meetings and uh have a reliability study .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[ju]
3055.73	If it's reliable enough , then we must just uh just annotate a small part of the meetings and using some learning techniques to boot boot-strap the uh uh automatic uh analyser .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	annotate	[]	[]	[]
5251.59	I will try my best , yeah .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
5265.62	So I might take two weeks off two weeks off in uh May , yeah , sometimes , yeah .	EN2005a.A.words.xml	take	[two weeks, two weeks]	[]	[May]
997.86	But we'll also have to write the the thing in that time .	EN2001e.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1127.31	Yeah , it would buy us something .	EN2001e.A.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
2056.85	And um for the longer utterances I just um look how often um one of these words is in there and simply add it up .	EN2001e.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2245.82	Or think .	EN2001e.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2265.69	Yeah , it's just I mean it's it's exactly this thing , but just I would I would just have to re-scale this factor here .	EN2001e.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2282.01	Yeah , I can just give it to you in the format you want .	EN2001e.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2288.64	And then score , yeah , it this was just for showing it .	EN2001e.A.words.xml	score	[]	[]	[]
2413.71	So and I th my my hypothesis was that if it's really yeah , uh like agreement , it will sound different than if it than into if it is just a back-channel .	EN2001e.A.words.xml	sound	[]	[]	[]
2501.29	Yeah , but we would throw a lot away that are quite good .	EN2001e.A.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
2506.32	If you if you would set it off .	EN2001e.A.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[]
2943.69	Okay , then you you will provide a file with all the mappings from the old ones to the 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[]
3398.79	Yeah , I mean if you if you if you present the components of what it it's based on , then you will need more than twenty minutes to present it , I guess .	EN2001e.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
3881.81	I mean it would behave strangely in the eyes of the user .	EN2001e.A.words.xml	behave	[]	[]	[]
79.98	Well , could you um put my slides up 'cause I think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time .	IS1009b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
120.69	Cause that's where m my discussion starts .	IS1009b.D.words.xml	Cause	[]	[]	[]
180.11	So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those .	IS1009b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
222.22	And take out their wallet and buy it .	IS1009b.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
311.75	I'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control what'll be And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible .	IS1009b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
479.65	Okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle .	IS1009b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
498.02	If somebody says , oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead .	IS1009b.D.words.xml	come	[next week]	[]	[]
510.54	And , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use .	IS1009b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
885.04	'Cause that might help with the marketing .	IS1009b.D.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
891.44	Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of silly for children or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is .	IS1009b.D.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
991.18	You know , like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it .	IS1009b.D.words.xml	develop	[]	[]	[]
1000.76	But we'll get to that with you .	IS1009b.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1697.62	You can make a banana shaped one .	IS1009b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1985.06	Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um 	IS1009b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
70.99	And then we can go back and replace pieces either by our own components or by more sophisticated compo po components of our own .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
114.6	well go back first of all and look at NITE X.M.L. to see in how far that that which we want is compatible with that which NITE X.M.L. offers us .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[NITE, X.M.L., NITE, X.M.L.]
278.25	'Cause that would make it a lot more like that would mean that our interface for the data would have to be a lot more careful about how it performs and and everything .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
369.68	And we can just more or less look at their code , like how their player moves forward , and how that moving forward is represented in different windows and stuff .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
411.68	What I'm like what we have to think about is if we go with this multi-level idea , like this idea that sort of if you start with a whole meeting series as one entity , as one thing that you display , as one whole sort of , that then the individual chunks of the individual meetings , whereas and then you can click on a meeting , and then sort of the meeting is the whole thing and the chunks are the individual segments , that means sort of we have multiple levels of of representation , which we probably 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
538.68	And just have different like fine-grainedness levels sort of .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
662.32	Like we would have words with some priority levels .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
703.9	We I think we have start and end times for words actually , but it's yeah , but it m it might s but it might sound crazy in the player .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	sound	[]	[]	[]
709.73	We should really maybe we can do that together at some point today that we check out how the player works .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
937.12	But that would mean it would still play the uh in your audio , unless we sort of also store what pieces we cut out for the audio .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1015.36	That's okay , that we can do .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1036.33	If maybe if we realise that there's massive differences in in gain or in something , you can probably just make some simple simple normalization , but that really depends on how much time we have and and how much is necessary .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1073.53	Because then we can also do the display about who's speaking .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1120.12	We do get an error message with the project if we load everything into the project with all the data they load .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1204.44	Let's check that out .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1205.83	Um I'll p I'll probably ask Jonathan about it .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[Jonathan]
1281.72	Yeah , sort of like off-line create a virtual meeting , which which basically treats the meeting series as if it was a meeting , and treats the individual meetings within the series as if they were segments , and treats the individual segments within meetings as if they were um utterances .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
1303.25	And in that way we could probably use the same algorithm and just like make vir like one or two ifs that say okay , if you are on a whole document uh a whole series level and that was a double-click , then don't just go into that um segment , but load a new file or something like it , but in general use the same algorithm .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[algorithm]
1391.02	Yeah , and if you make that structurally very similar to the the le like one level down , like the way how we uh store individual utterances and stuff , then maybe we can more or less use the same code and just make a few ifs and stuff .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1442.39	so the skimming can work on that because the skimming just sort of sorts the utterances and puts as many in as it needs 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1455.15	Yeah , it'll it'll play them in some order in which they were set because otherwise it's gonna be more entertaining .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1505.19	Yeah , and then you sort of feed the time stamp to and the NITE X.M.L. central manager , and that central manager alerts everything that's there , like alerts the skim like the the audio display , alerts the text display , alerts the visual display and says we have a new time frame and then they all sort of do their update routines with respect to the current level of zoom .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	feed	[]	[]	[NITE, X.M.L.]
1523.26	So how much do they display , and starting position at where the or maybe the mid-position of it , I don't know , like w if start where the thing was found or if that thing wa was found it's in the middle of the part that we display , that I don't know .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
1535.69	But that we can decide about , but a general sort of 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1597.65	So we can just create an additional X.M.L. file which for every utterance like the utterances have I.D.s I presume , some references .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
1712.37	That's just so like to make a list of all this stuff , or we probably can somebody can do it on paper .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1720.87	So what so the stuff we have we have utterances and speakers and weights for utterances .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1896.02	So if this lazy loading works , then this should definitely fit into I mean not memory then because it wouldn't all be in memory at the same time .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1916.15	And even though probably if there's a lot of over-head in having two different files , we can probably merge the weights into it off-line .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	merge	[]	[]	[]
1976.71	But that we can figure out I mean if it's going horrendously wrong .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
2108.64	When do we need the one for the meet 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2114.1	Yeah , I guess for the so when we have the display , will we display the whole series .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
2179.43	Also like for this part , maybe if we go over it with named entity in the end , if I mean w if one of the people doing DIL has some named entity code to spare , and just like at least for the for sort of for finding topics , titles for for segments , just take a named entity which has a really high , what's it called , D.F.I.D.F. , whatever .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2312.58	Yeah , that would mean understanding the NITE X.M.L. X.M.L. sort of format in a lot more detail .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[NITE, X.M.L., X.M.L.]
2317.35	We should I think we should just have a long session in the computer room together and like now that we know a bit more what we want , take a closer look at NITE X.M.L. .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[NITE, X.M.L.]
2514.75	Or just adapt like their like just sort of go from their system and and adapt that piece for piece and see how we could 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	adapt	[]	[]	[]
2522.48	how we could arran like adapt it to our 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	arran	[]	[]	[]
2590.5	Okay , so I'll just meet you in in eighteen a in the afternoon .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	meet	[eighteen]	[]	[]
2615.22	Like at the moment you can all do your stuff and I can do my L.S.A. stuff .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[L.S.A.]
2619.75	And I can even do the display to a vast degree without actually having their supplying framework working .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2800.12	It would probably find another number task quite easily seeing that it's a constrained vocabulary with a high co-occurrence of the same nine words .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2887.6	Yeah , so we should work together on that , because I need a dictionary as well .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
3017.27	So you can easily end up with hundred thousands of words when you didn't expect them .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	end	[]	[]	[]
3030.57	Well you can probably also you can probably pre-filter like with regular expressions even just say if it consists of only dig digits , then skip it , or even if it consists any special characters , then skip it because it's probably something with a dot in between , which is usually not something you wanna have and 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[dig]
3101.61	Well I guess as soon as we have the raw text , we can probably just start with the Java hash map and like just hash map over it and see how far we get .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[Java]
3108.12	I mean we can probably on a machine with a few hundred megabyte RAM you can go quite far .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
3112.94	You can write it on beefy .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
3159.75	So if it's from s well actually I think if it's mounted , you can directly burn from there , but the problem is I have my data on beefy and so I have to get it into the local temp directory and burn it from there .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	burn	[]	[]	[]
3168.69	But you can burn it from there .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	burn	[]	[]	[]
3197.54	See I would off I would offer you to to get it on this one , and then um like copy it .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	offer	[]	[]	[]
3231.64	Yeah , burn it to C.D. or , yeah , put it on on hard disk , whatever .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	burn	[]	[]	[C.D.]
3244.97	So if you could compress it and just put it into a temp directory .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	compress	[]	[]	[]
3266.18	Ah yeah , but that would have to be the temp directory off the machine you can S.S.H. into directory of S.S.H. .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[S.S.H.]
3289.81	They'd probably they'd like you more if you S.S.H. uh into another computer , compress it there and then sort of copy it into the into the gateway machine .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	compress	[]	[]	[]
3388.85	As soon as somebody gives me the raw text of the whole thing , I can probably just implement like a five line Java hash table frequency dictionary builder and see 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	implement	[]	[]	[Java]
3422.64	Yeah , you'd have to count it yourself , yeah .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3502.11	So yeah , so um I'll get that from you and I'll write the hash table which goes over that and creates a dictionary file .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
3588.24	So I could probably get that .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
3720.47	Because if we're doing Like I think for for the information density we uh we should calculate it on the lowest level , not on the highest .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	calculate	[]	[]	[]
3947.32	So sorry , could describe that again , the 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	describe	[]	[]	[]
4140.24	By just making like it w read write for everyone .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
4163.39	Well we alternatively we can probably just make another directory on the beefy scratch space .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
4361.73	Wait , wait , wait .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
4371.94	What I just realised , we should really t keep different serieses completely separate for virtually all purposes .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
4432.44	I mean you can do everything you want in one series .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
4461.74	So at at every level everyone has to be careful to really just take even at the highest level , just take stuff from one series and not merge stuff from different series together because they would probably be just majorly messy .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
4595.33	Okay , so for now can you create like sort of just uh a dump which is pure text , just pure text so that I can get a dictionary and you can work on that for your topic segmentation .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
4613.9	But I can but I can also deal with separate files , I mean I can just write the algorithm that it loads all files in a directory or something .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	deal	[]	[]	[algorithm]
4640.08	So give m give me different files as long as like it m if you could name them in a way that is easy to enumerate over them , like whatever , one two three four five or something .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
4723.01	'Cause I'll need that then when it's done .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
4826.63	So I'll create a dictionary .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
4838.44	Add add the structure , yeah .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
4961.86	I I'll I'll check if I understand how it works .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
4964.13	I mean otherwise I can give you the code for loading a dictionary .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
4967.66	Give you my my it's just it's it's sort of it's a line break separated file , you know .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	Give	[]	[]	[]
4994.71	Yeah , but do they automatically write to the file anyway I'll I'll figure that out .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
5026.35	I'll build a dictionary as soon as I get the text .	EN2001a.E.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
647.17	So when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
775.03	Let's delegate .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
817.97	You can even have them in different flavours as well .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
820.93	So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , yeah .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[]
1280.39	You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	seem	[]	[]	[]
1402.1	um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	group	[]	[]	[]
1430.37	It has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
1445.25	a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	appear	[]	[]	[]
1463.08	Like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	do	[the next half hour]	[]	[]
1487.57	um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
1550.27	And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[Sky]
1639.27	s engineer .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	engineer	[]	[]	[]
1698.85	And enter in the middle , so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	enter	[]	[]	[]
1711.87	Really we'd have to use something to show you , but 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1731.72	It does scroll , but it is hugely complicated .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
1792.99	Look at look at this one .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
1803.89	Might take up your whole living room .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1864.0	uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2043.62	But it does depend how much 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	depend	[]	[]	[]
2060.04	Do your exercises while you're watching the T.V. .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[T.V.]
2191.6	Well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them , and 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[wanna]
2220.81	Just copy the one on the left .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	copy	[]	[]	[]
2227.67	Well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen .	ES2013c.C.words.xml	correspond	[]	[]	[]
2237.06	Yeah , I'd like push buttons with 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
2241.8	So push buttons 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
299.9	'Cause I can take forever on this .	TS3006a.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
398.61	Dude you're a good drawer .	TS3006a.C.words.xml	Dude	[]	[]	[]
429.14	They kind of l look like mole legs .	TS3006a.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
510.31	Let's see .	TS3006a.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
570.73	Excuse my language .	TS3006a.C.words.xml	Excuse	[]	[]	[]
587.42	Or do I need to use more colours and 	TS3006a.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
712.2	So I had to uh , I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , and kind of let it work in to get ideas about 	TS3006a.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
792.43	I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also .	TS3006a.C.words.xml	flip	[]	[]	[ch, ch, teletext]
1049.09	We'll do our best .	TS3006a.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1122.84	Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player .	TS3006a.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[ne]
1146.98	Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh 	TS3006a.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1150.93	in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh 	TS3006a.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1206.88	See you later .	TS3006a.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
337.4	then we we could use it .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
501.4	So , just move to the next slide .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
538.99	Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
570.0	So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
597.3	you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	break	[]	[]	[]
647.67	We could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
654.19	Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
817.21	You can throw it to the television .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
940.86	You can make it um 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1017.33	Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , yeah , and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1037.3	You can put also vibrator inside .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1044.79	You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1208.97	Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1217.36	Should have the two sides .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1417.52	Maybe you can make uh uh mm okay .	IS1001c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
119.59	So you can make it very easy to use .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
122.41	'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
166.1	I'll give comments .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
255.67	But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
271.89	Yeah , you can put 'em all on the back .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
289.99	I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
327.67	will uh will show up .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
374.92	I'll get back to later .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
400.68	Um we'll use hard plastic .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
409.39	Colour changeable .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	Colour	[]	[]	[]
488.04	You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
516.48	scroll in the , navigate the menu .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	navigate	[]	[]	[]
534.92	So you have one left for the Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	Play	[]	[]	[Play, Station]
584.53	Mm where do we have 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
617.64	Just press it once , the colour should uh switch .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
762.81	Um do we need to fix that or 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
817.88	If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	abo	[]	[]	[]
1129.64	To light it all up .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	light	[]	[]	[]
1374.29	Save .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
1461.02	You can different front uh 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	different	[]	[]	[]
1508.23	To call .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
1762.07	check the time , etcetera .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
2035.35	Oh , what do we have to do now .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2052.77	Mm we can do it afterwards , so 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2233.1	I do agree with that .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
2343.14	Come on .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
2422.88	I'll put it here .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2459.27	Then do it correctly .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2510.99	Pen , select select pen .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[Pen]
2525.73	Oh yeah , I can know it .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
2678.59	Come on .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
2706.09	Mm I'll clean that up later .	TS3004d.B.words.xml	clean	[]	[]	[]
65.17	Yeah , and have this discussion every two years .	IB4002.C.words.xml	have	[two years]	[]	[]
74.06	make sense for everyone .	IB4002.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
75.27	So we can choose where to put uh , I would say , the the the three first one of the list .	IB4002.C.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
133.4	can switch .	IB4002.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
157.69	So we need to put Pirette , Andrei and Nancy do we want to the the question is now is do we want to put the three together or the three completely separate 	IB4002.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[Pirette, Andrei, Nancy]
258.62	So we might think that it's better to have a more comfortable office than a more comfortable reading room , I don't know , it change the plan of the morning , I'm sorry , but I just realised that stupid architect put only one windows .	IB4002.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
319.95	Say it again .	IB4002.C.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
371.15	Let's put a fifty per cent so 	IB4002.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
383.78	You will learn to know him .	IB4002.C.words.xml	learn	[]	[]	[]
460.77	So and can you put the the map again , so we s see what happen .	IB4002.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
524.69	Pick a room .	IB4002.C.words.xml	Pick	[]	[]	[]
597.68	And we might put Martin and Andrei and someone else in the three person room , since the fifty per cent , it's a good 	IB4002.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[Martin, Andrei]
956.42	to change a little bit this disadvantage we put somebody fifty per cent , in 	IB4002.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
960.95	three person room , so we could do the same in the three person rooms , but there is still this problem yeah .	IB4002.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1034.01	You can move with your desktop , yeah .	IB4002.C.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
1077.93	Keep this office for reception people .	IB4002.C.words.xml	Keep	[]	[]	[]
1120.6	Yeah , to find us and it's also quite noisy when you have this kind of 	IB4002.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1529.88	And since you nee you will meet the administrator , can we ask for a coffee machine somewhere .	IB4002.C.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
1557.08	Yeah but try .	IB4002.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
31.33	And they require that the uh actually I'll get to that at the end point number four , um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
86.78	Uh there we go , just screw 'em on in .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	screw	[]	[]	[]
106.71	Should do it , good one .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
127.14	Hold on , sorry .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	Hold	[]	[]	[]
329.15	Just escape .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	escape	[]	[]	[]
639.59	That can come under Arlo as well .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[Arlo]
917.08	Let's remember that .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
973.62	But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1049.09	If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1254.23	'Kay , thank you very much , um I'll take that back .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[Kay]
1303.08	Um , dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	dunno	[]	[]	[Oracle]
1394.69	We'll use the the basic functions for a television .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1400.49	Um okay hold on .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
1409.23	So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a or it looks like we're just cutting on the um 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	strike	[]	[]	[]
1416.6	I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1424.26	Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they'll send 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1429.87	some information about that , about um what people , whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	require	[]	[]	[]
1470.4	However that does sound a bit like the 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	sound	[]	[]	[]
1603.49	Yeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for B.B.C. two on B.B.C. one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[B.B.C., B.B.C., one'll]
1669.79	That we should just stick on , yeah .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
1716.23	It might do us out of a job .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1765.0	you might have trouble incorporating the screen .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1790.96	Contrast contra well .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	Contrast	[]	[]	[]
1811.17	Okay , well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , um if we're gonna have to if we're gonna have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our um 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1825.54	Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1865.77	Um , okay so scratch that .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	scratch	[]	[]	[]
1918.15	So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
1945.76	If you could find out that uh 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2018.06	And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
2026.81	Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well .	ES2005b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2035.49	And um I'll put any I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , so uh 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2078.76	And I will tr getting strings of um information , I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as I get them now , rather than I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
180.62	So w it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that 	IS1005a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
248.2	So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here .	IS1005a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
256.33	For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it .	IS1005a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
310.27	So I will ask you all to do the same .	IS1005a.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
325.0	Yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course .	IS1005a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
541.96	You can draw it , if you want .	IS1005a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
682.16	So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea .	IS1005a.A.words.xml	share	[]	[]	[]
867.16	Let's continue .	IS1005a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
867.75	I have a meeting in five minutes , so maybe we should hurry .	IS1005a.A.words.xml	hurry	[]	[]	[]
874.98	So we will close uh this meeting .	IS1005a.A.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
878.56	So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes .	IS1005a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
889.89	The So I will ask you to do some work .	IS1005a.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
893.49	Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and 	IS1005a.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
905.73	read about Yeah .	IS1005a.A.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
959.72	Um , you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach .	IS1005a.A.words.xml	receive	[]	[]	[]
374.79	But to get a cluster the location that is uh a place where uh noise is regularly coming from .	IN1009.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1030.61	For the first application we will do with uh prototypes , it will be more about quantity uh of speech or how long , how much someone speak , but when we will go to final uh details , if I'm talking and someone say yes yes yes from time to time , it show that he's participating , and obviously it makes different that if someone is talking and one is replying never uh nor moving or nor having eyes open 	IN1009.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1074.78	Go through them .	IN1009.C.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1096.4	Try .	IN1009.C.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
294.62	And uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me .	ES2007a.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
770.31	So do we have to be realistic within the budget or 	ES2007a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
850.08	I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated .	ES2007a.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
864.42	No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but 	ES2007a.B.words.xml	slide	[]	[]	[]
890.57	Start breaking up .	ES2007a.B.words.xml	Start	[]	[]	[]
1164.78	Do you think our two kind of overlap , because 	ES2007a.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
151.31	You can look at the final report , 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
193.83	So who wants go .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
513.18	Calculator's can do it .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1060.57	So you can hold it .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
1168.93	Well we could make a compromise between that .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1182.29	So to appeal a little more to the all the public .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	appeal	[]	[]	[]
1208.12	Yeah I'd agree .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1270.14	can turn it maybe .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
1271.79	To switch from buttons to interface hmm .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
1315.98	If you can uh flip .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	flip	[]	[]	[]
1338.91	make this 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1385.89	But you can hide the okay and the back uh button .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	hide	[]	[]	[]
1405.49	You could just make it mechanical .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1436.01	So it can bounce .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	bounce	[]	[]	[]
1480.1	Maybe can design two versions .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
1640.59	You could also make line with uh Yeah .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1737.75	And then you can use yellow or semething .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1914.8	You can make them red .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1951.11	change the colour so 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
2008.86	You will do the evaluation .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2029.98	Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2051.36	Look-and-feel and 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
2077.39	show to the management .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
2091.78	Oh and save this uh board .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
2095.41	Just save it .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
2108.64	You can also include clip-art .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
2112.44	So if you'll rather draw in paint or something 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2127.73	then look .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2145.15	You can also include it .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
2397.28	Keep the flip live .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	Keep	[]	[]	[]
2517.47	So maybe you can include that somewhere .	TS3006c.A.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
126.64	Um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see .	ES2005d.A.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
329.9	Say it for the camera .	ES2005d.A.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
488.25	Well we can work around that um 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
492.43	Cut things out .	ES2005d.A.words.xml	Cut	[]	[]	[]
529.53	We should fire the accountants .	ES2005d.A.words.xml	fire	[]	[]	[]
532.85	Fire the accountants .	ES2005d.A.words.xml	Fire	[]	[]	[]
540.15	Ah yeah , we could add things .	ES2005d.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
543.82	Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys .	ES2005d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
752.72	Uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay .	ES2005d.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1349.01	Yeah round it up to two .	ES2005d.A.words.xml	round	[]	[]	[]
1405.13	As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1426.96	I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1564.42	I'll go with two .	ES2005d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
98.7	Um , do I need to plugged in .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
122.8	I will take this time just to apologise .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
147.87	And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[]
191.06	And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
201.98	Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
210.27	Um , also we could use um an alarm .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
214.35	So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
229.5	Um , so that would work .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
232.15	Go back there .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
263.82	So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	expand	[]	[]	[]
270.63	So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	spring	[]	[]	[]
321.62	Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
341.47	I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	return	[]	[]	[]
350.12	Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
368.73	Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
381.15	You could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	empl	[]	[]	[]
436.35	All you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	destruct	[]	[]	[]
467.03	Sorry , should I go back .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
468.89	This would actually show the circuit diagram .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
775.21	And limit the design .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	limit	[]	[]	[]
1142.89	To get the right reception and picture , I suppose .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1390.73	teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	teletext	[]	[]	[]
1670.18	Work on that .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	Work	[]	[]	[]
1802.54	Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	vibrate	[]	[]	[]
1821.25	If Do you mean the the link between the Well , if the button was actually on 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1869.44	Um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T.V.'s supplied from .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
2075.73	And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	wear	[]	[]	[]
2122.29	Yeah , and we could Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , which could like link in with the company colours .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	link	[]	[]	[]
2201.02	Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something .	ES2015b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2235.82	And also possible I mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T.V. shows , or 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	gain	[]	[]	[T.V.]
2272.73	Let's 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
0.07	Hey look , these are microphones they uh they're for women's shirts .	IB4004.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
157.04	If we could avoid it , it would much simplify things , but uh , well , we'll see .	IB4004.A.words.xml	avoid	[]	[]	[]
173.32	It it's more a matter of how to arrange the furniture , but uh since we are experts at this task uh okay , so maybe we could count on on four places , but the final decision is not really ours , so uh we'll see actually this 	IB4004.A.words.xml	count	[]	[]	[]
246.78	In red you have the uh uh oh , excuse me , that's quite uh annoying , excuse me .	IB4004.A.words.xml	excuse	[]	[]	[]
256.57	Oh , yeah , um , can I can I call you a bit later in about half an hour .	IB4004.A.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
370.36	Yeah , we'll have to check tha yeah , but the printer is quite small if we fi find just a small table for it .	IB4004.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
376.96	maybe one day we'll have a photocopy that is also a printer .	IB4004.A.words.xml	have	[one day]	[]	[]
413.26	If you can suggest something uh better , because she's with two people who uh well , two P.H.D. students , and it's true that she has , yeah , a lot of phone calls to make , but um it's some way to to solve some constraints .	IB4004.A.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[]
431.33	Uh if you want we can use this document or we could just , say , first listen to your suggestions and see if we erase everything or just do some modifications using this one .	IB4004.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
502.31	Yeah , we could store files there and things like that .	IB4004.A.words.xml	store	[]	[]	[]
510.37	Okay , so if you want I can already do this change here .	IB4004.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
554.56	So maybe I would suggest let me le k can I hear also let us hear from you .	IB4004.A.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[]
561.25	And then if we can work out a solu a common solution from this one , then we go back to to this slide .	IB4004.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
567.77	And if not , um we'll just , well start from scratch .	IB4004.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
586.9	Yeah , I'll try .	IB4004.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
587.7	I'll bring my walkman and uh 	IB4004.A.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
629.25	I will display uh yeah , this is the empty one .	IB4004.A.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
633.47	So so you would put uh 	IB4004.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
643.39	you can you can even stand and just show us there .	IB4004.A.words.xml	stand	[]	[]	[]
650.82	Okay , so we would prefer the names .	IB4004.A.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
847.94	I um so we could put Nancy with David and uh put Agnes yeah .	IB4004.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[Nancy, David, Agnes]
1026.34	And we'll find some way to um , well , attach it to a wall or something like this .	IB4004.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1239.54	And uh here we'll put two places for visitors .	IB4004.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1255.96	Okay , so that could take the the free place over there .	IB4004.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1310.28	I'll I'll have my head cut off if we don't have a lounge .	IB4004.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1377.02	Y we could put the visitor with you , Martin , but it's probably okay , let's try le let's try this .	IB4004.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[Martin]
1396.82	No no , we'll put a visitor place in there .	IB4004.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1423.0	No , I I would prefer you , I think .	IB4004.A.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
1430.84	Okay , we'll put Paola and a visitor here .	IB4004.A.words.xml	put	[]	[Paola]	[]
1445.69	And then we'll we'll still have probably some way to put a second visitor here .	IB4004.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1450.15	Vis two .	IB4004.A.words.xml	Vis	[]	[]	[]
1603.25	Let me call this visitor one , which implies that uh it will be the first one occupied by a visitor when they come .	IB4004.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1666.61	Yeah , so maybe in the long run we'll get a wall .	IB4004.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1675.23	So where would we move David to Maria Da with Maria .	IB4004.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[David, Maria, Da, Maria]
1787.04	Yeah , well , we are almost done , Susan , but uh we we'll we'll just check the the items .	IB4004.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[Susan]
1796.36	Yeah , we we'll just review the items to see is we look at all the constraints and then you'll be able to say the final uh yes or no .	IB4004.A.words.xml	review	[]	[]	[]
1840.2	Yeah , that's a bit yeah , that was the point in letting David there and but okay , maybe we'll just leave it as an option .	IB4004.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[David]
1872.54	So we'll know that uh that the region actually around here is probably movable .	IB4004.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1878.85	Yeah , either , yeah , we can switch Maria or Paola or David .	IB4004.A.words.xml	switch	[]	[Paola]	[Maria, David]
1892.1	Yeah , tha tha yeah , that's why I always try to put the to separate the visitors , just to balance a little bit .	IB4004.A.words.xml	balance	[]	[]	[]
1903.44	Yeah , it will become 	IB4004.A.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
1945.94	Um so um we'll we'll have actually I I'll present this to , well , with the other , I'll compare it with the other one , and uh try to make a decision actually .	IB4004.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1978.77	W we can leave it like this and then 	IB4004.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
2028.42	Yeah , we'll we'll keep it like this .	IB4004.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
2030.75	Um okay I , well , I'll try to to express all these constraints and uh and say in particular that the two rooms over here actually are sort of uh , well , s things could be changed over there , but on some other sides 	IB4004.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2088.9	A as far as know I think Agnes is also taking care of a proposal so okay , yeah , I'll circulate this .	IB4004.A.words.xml	circulate	[]	[]	[Agnes]
2102.37	Okay , so maybe we'll learn some more constraints .	IB4004.A.words.xml	learn	[]	[]	[]
2110.29	Um yeah , actually as I as I told uh Martin um , well , this is the last time we meet , so uh this is , well , more or less our proposal , and uh we'll have a meeting , I think , it's uh it's in two days or something like that .	IB4004.A.words.xml	have	[two days]	[]	[Martin]
2124.32	Uh to discuss and compare with the other proposal and uh , well , make a final decision .	IB4004.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
2129.27	Actually , probably a pre-final one , since we'll have to check again with everyone .	IB4004.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2244.2	Uh , normally it's done automatically , except that we'll have to think 	IB4004.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2299.42	Yeah , we'll get uh we'll get all the information .	IB4004.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2310.71	We'll we'll check .	IB4004.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
2349.27	We'll try it I'm , well I'll try to to express the the constraints and uh your opinions and uh well , I think , finally everyone can veto something if there is a huge problem , but I think with this we we don't run into huge problems .	IB4004.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
296.96	To merge the two system huh .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	merge	[]	[]	[]
335.4	For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	escape	[]	[]	[]
414.85	So we can move to the next slide .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
422.23	to give an industrial design of the remote control .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
434.1	how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T.V. .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	relate	[]	[]	[T.V.]
488.62	Let's see .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
489.63	You can move to the next slide , so .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
510.32	You can go to the next slide .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
538.75	Look .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
557.55	because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
601.98	It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
613.51	We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
617.21	We can have both also .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
692.46	Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
732.56	Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[Graphical, User, Designer]
1098.54	Look fancy .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
1405.35	Yeah , but this this mean that your T.V. would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .	IS1003b.B.words.xml	connect	[]	[]	[T.V.]
445.84	And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything's listed down .	ES2011d.D.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
455.29	Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use .	ES2011d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
468.37	We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards .	ES2011d.D.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
515.19	And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully .	ES2011d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
796.1	We'll just do um 	ES2011d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
815.65	We'll just go in a circle .	ES2011d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1223.5	Yeah and just have the colour match or something .	ES2011d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1327.86	Think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one .	ES2011d.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1467.83	Do you want this and we can all 	ES2011d.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
261.68	Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[Jens, Damman]
267.09	Wait .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
315.28	So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
330.75	Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
342.97	Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
406.67	Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you clap your hands it will beep or something .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
413.36	Uh you must find it uh quickly .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
424.78	Yeah , we can uh combine that .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	combine	[]	[]	[]
521.42	I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
561.29	Yeah , only only for television uh On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[Euros]
623.22	Yeah , to k to keep it simple when you Sorry I thought about it , yes .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
649.6	You can ask some questions or something .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1093.11	Maybe we can give it out in different colours .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1095.28	You can choose blue or yellow or 	TS3004b.D.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1387.28	And you can stop it , and then it's okay .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	stop	[]	[]	[]
1690.79	But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2038.96	So if you No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .	TS3004b.D.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
167.63	Get that off the shelf .	ES2003c.D.words.xml	Get	[]	[]	[]
199.52	can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one .	ES2003c.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
247.99	We should probably just use conventional batteries .	ES2003c.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
333.28	an okay button around here , so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily .	ES2003c.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
384.82	and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com P.C.s .	ES2003c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[P.C.s]
532.47	Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control .	ES2003c.D.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
539.64	If you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T.V. .	ES2003c.D.words.xml	translate	[]	[]	[T.V.]
564.85	uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh 	ES2003c.D.words.xml	interact	[]	[]	[]
618.66	maybe use single curved uh case .	ES2003c.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
623.94	Because we might need it to be curved for the uh 	ES2003c.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
633.33	and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L.C.D. .	ES2003c.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1225.59	Forgot to say that .	ES2003c.D.words.xml	Forgot	[]	[]	[]
32.1	I uh now will show it .	TS3012c.D.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
936.24	So I can uh show my uh investigation .	TS3012c.D.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
1292.08	But you can make uh if you want to use a fruit in uh in uh 	TS3012c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1307.66	You can make it like 	TS3012c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1517.06	And speech w recognition .	TS3012c.D.words.xml	speech	[]	[]	[]
144.46	So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[ti, sec]
171.16	No the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
192.71	We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
238.57	So that they could know how to use these remote controls .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
297.73	So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
808.22	Uh i it will be easy because there will be , on L.C.D. s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1253.59	Yeah , I appreciate this idea , because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
1347.36	Yeah , then only we can relate it with something .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	relate	[]	[]	[]
1357.69	Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1591.38	Or we can we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1606.94	So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , it will look l Uh yeah .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1635.45	If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1642.47	If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
1649.06	It will give apple shape look .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1650.82	So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , without uh yeah .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1662.43	Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , so half of that will be look the Yeah , not not the upper side .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1670.83	So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1903.87	They can they can recharge it .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	recharge	[]	[]	[]
2018.36	Uh excuse me , Bri 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	excuse	[]	[]	[Bri]
2026.82	You just touch the pad , yeah .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	touch	[]	[]	[]
2085.31	I will show you , in shared documents .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
2095.84	I will send new .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
2097.28	Uh I'll put it in shared documents , again .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2123.89	I'll show you .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
2177.57	Uh excuse me , Brian .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	excuse	[]	[]	[Brian]
2260.15	Excuse me .	ES2005c.B.words.xml	Excuse	[]	[]	[]
568.05	Okay , go 	IS1003a.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
667.77	Have to be really careful .	IS1003a.C.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
89.02	Uh display .	TS3006b.B.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
567.69	Um if you all go stand around uh 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	stand	[]	[]	[]
594.1	And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples .	TS3006b.B.words.xml	merge	[]	[]	[]
639.75	But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option .	TS3006b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
664.92	Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed .	TS3006b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
729.46	Um the we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down .	TS3006b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
912.4	Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[shou]
1059.75	I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display .	TS3006b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1300.96	And do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1542.45	We we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1997.85	Uh I think we have to to group , to make two groups .	TS3006b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2189.04	So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button .	TS3006b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1232.69	I'd put it at one I think , but I dunno , what do you 	ES2013d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1471.04	Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest .	ES2013d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1490.97	Um do we have 	ES2013d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1520.1	Yeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , but it depends on the cost , I guess .	ES2013d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1543.29	Do we need to say how many buttons , or 	ES2013d.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1800.12	Oh hang on , we haven't heard .	ES2013d.B.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[]
291.12	I will give a a five .	IS1001d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
692.4	Start to eat banana .	IS1001d.B.words.xml	Start	[]	[]	[]
199.12	We'll have big discussion I suppose after that , so .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
301.3	Yeah , but suppose you got a cold .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	suppose	[]	[]	[]
352.17	Yeah , but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
443.75	Suppose we're we want to sell it in France .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[France]	[]
551.94	Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[li]
572.13	Yeah , but you can lose it .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
587.81	Okay you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on T.V. and just to recognize gestures and voice .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[T.V.]
654.03	We'll try the controllers you'd prefer .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
689.05	Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1177.8	Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1481.24	So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , maybe will attract 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	attract	[]	[]	[]
1503.22	Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	propose	[]	[]	[]
1542.7	Th The feeling is natural , so maybe we can stay with wood .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
1622.28	So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[Google]
1691.39	You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1728.59	So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1743.48	So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1759.55	Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Baba]
1789.81	And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
1807.23	So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , so you will have to model model something .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Baba, David, Jordan]
1830.18	So , no more questions , we can close the session .	IS1003c.A.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
50.66	I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
60.54	Um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
85.86	And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Poppy]
92.14	Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
401.93	It , it we would have to have an L.C.D. um 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
550.99	It would work that way .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
627.57	It could make an we could have any kind of style .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
677.9	Yeah , you can watch a T.V. in the dark then .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	watch	[]	[]	[T.V.]
719.06	Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
1062.51	Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1104.75	If they were white they would glow , probably .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	glow	[]	[]	[]
1171.5	So that you can feel them .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
1413.66	um , do , according to our plans already , given the market .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1486.35	Tone it down .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	Tone	[]	[]	[]
1531.97	So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
1607.47	Does anyone know how to take it out of 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1638.4	I mean will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's , 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1884.56	And most televisions will come with a remote .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
2018.1	Wait a minute .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
2030.22	Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Poppy, Tara]
2035.04	And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2119.47	'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[Kay]
2123.33	And , um , we'll reconvene in thirty minutes .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	reconvene	[]	[]	[]
2132.84	Oh , what did I just do .	ES2015c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
131.64	Try the power button .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
234.92	Uh give some um 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
330.8	You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	upload	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
373.76	Uh , we well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[pu, puttin]
415.73	So you can use a pen .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
416.85	You can use an eraser .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
421.03	And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
435.8	And then select current colour or line width .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
452.36	Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
461.47	Uh , I'll start off then .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
464.18	I'll use this uh same sheet .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
523.84	Think it is .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
620.9	Uh , make a new sheet .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
631.3	And uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
703.66	Well , tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
769.98	I'll do so .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
849.12	Well , you can have a piranha at home .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
952.4	Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1072.89	So wha what 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[]
1171.09	When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , or we should make it combination of that .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1200.74	Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1220.04	The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , we will uh 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	w	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
1269.23	Yeah , close it .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
1298.71	Or we can leave already I guess .	TS3008a.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
0.02	Think we can first 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
75.42	just gonna leave this up here 'cause I'll you know .	ES2007b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
150.62	sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically .	ES2007b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
202.4	We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all .	ES2007b.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
209.12	Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it .	ES2007b.A.words.xml	conclude	[]	[]	[]
462.66	Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down .	ES2007b.A.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[wanna]
936.67	Look into .	ES2007b.A.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
1016.31	Let's plug you in , baby .	ES2007b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1332.42	Let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .	ES2007b.A.words.xml	Let	[ten years' time]	[]	[]
1383.34	we've decide we've d 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1413.66	I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries .	ES2007b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1426.59	Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries .	ES2007b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1521.72	Send me , yeah yeah , okay .	ES2007b.A.words.xml	Send	[]	[]	[]
1595.35	It's got to so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps .	ES2007b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1677.39	Take your headsets off , kick back , smoke 'em if you got 'em .	ES2007b.A.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
976.7	Just give some questions uh 	IN1008.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1255.97	Maybe you can detect breathing .	IN1008.D.words.xml	detect	[]	[]	[]
1262.05	Yeah , that you could do .	IN1008.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1478.71	So if you use higher frequencies you can get more precise localization .	IN1008.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1535.6	Um you can use multiple ones and do some um um triangulation .	IN1008.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1573.51	Yeah , then you might get uh better direction in elevation .	IN1008.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1607.3	With one you will only get direction .	IN1008.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1803.07	Um each frame is taking thirty two millisecond of signal , just to give an idea .	IN1008.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1938.47	Uh um uh what we do release a phase domain analysis .	IN1008.D.words.xml	release	[]	[]	[]
1971.7	And the end is um a number of uh frequency beams which are used by each person , to uh explain roughly .	IN1008.D.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
1994.1	So you will get a large value of band-width for people who speak .	IN1008.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1999.21	And uh for the others it will random .	IN1008.D.words.xml	random	[]	[]	[]
2027.49	So you can have um uh for one person you can have uh a high energy signal which is difficult to locate , and visa versa .	IN1008.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2042.62	So I would advise to um use more uh phase domain methods .	IN1008.D.words.xml	advise	[]	[]	[]
2062.12	So you can compare the phase of the microphones .	IN1008.D.words.xml	compare	[]	[]	[]
2081.22	But um maybe I'll go t to the board .	IN1008.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2103.33	So uh I'll just try to um s summarise .	IN1008.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2135.8	with F.F.T. you can just uh , as I said , l look at the phase between the microphones at a given frequency .	IN1008.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[F.F.T.]
2174.08	Uh this , I can point to a paper , uh I don't think this is the right place to explain everything .	IN1008.D.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
2178.97	But will give you if you look at your table , uh what we have developed here 	IN1008.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2201.22	in each sector you will get the value .	IN1008.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2219.43	And on this one you could have a large value .	IN1008.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2305.16	But then you'll get two large values .	IN1008.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2331.35	You can for example , if you use another array , uh you can intersect lines of direction .	IN1008.D.words.xml	intersect	[]	[]	[]
2425.76	you can split it and say uh all these parts belong to person one here .	IN1008.D.words.xml	split	[]	[]	[]
2448.76	But then uh you can look statistically it wi it will be negligible um because the r of uh of the difference level .	IN1008.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2466.08	And then you can do some uh maybe higher level um analysis where you get the pitch of the person or 	IN1008.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2539.03	you can uh separate the signals 	IN1008.D.words.xml	separate	[]	[]	[]
2546.22	do do processing .	IN1008.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2550.74	so uh you can get pitch , rate of speech .	IN1008.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2606.32	Uh so you would have to uh classify the sources as human or machine .	IN1008.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2645.74	So all will go and be detected there .	IN1008.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2706.66	Yeah , you can play with it .	IN1008.D.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
2772.81	You you might have to play with it just to save processing time , like use slightly longer frames .	IN1008.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2877.43	Two different person will speak .	IN1008.D.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
2879.99	So you can cluster those .	IN1008.D.words.xml	cluster	[]	[]	[]
2947.31	Um you can do sub-optimal processing and uh for example here I'm considering all possible pairs of microphones , uh which is twenty eight , and the processing is directly um r proportional to that .	IN1008.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2968.21	So um you can save on that .	IN1008.D.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
3044.24	So it could be sufficient to uh , yeah , define enough sectors and 	IN1008.D.words.xml	define	[]	[]	[]
3116.61	If you are able to calibrate your microphones um the ones who are closer to the person will get more energy .	IN1008.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
3127.49	Um so you can compare that .	IN1008.D.words.xml	compare	[]	[]	[]
3181.46	But you can kind of come back to that also .	IN1008.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
3237.52	We can also consider directional microphones .	IN1008.D.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
3255.51	So for example if there was a directional microphone pointing there you would get most of my energy but less from you , et cetera .	IN1008.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[et]
3265.23	You can also do microphone arrays with directional microphones .	IN1008.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
3344.77	Y you would uh assume 	IN1008.D.words.xml	assume	[]	[]	[]
3352.04	Uh you would neglect it .	IN1008.D.words.xml	neglect	[]	[]	[]
3364.86	Um you would assume that they are roughly synchronised , not necessarily very precisely , and um compare the energy levels .	IN1008.D.words.xml	assume	[]	[]	[]
418.27	Yeah , I can do that .	IS1001b.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
484.35	Okay so you can you can go .	IS1001b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
522.93	Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy .	IS1001b.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
529.92	Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look oh to it's not good .	IS1001b.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
575.65	So all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have um a use a real use and not only or 	IS1001b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
623.92	'Kay you can go so .	IS1001b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Kay]
644.86	to find it .	IS1001b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
733.54	Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the and uh and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that .	IS1001b.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
803.12	to have the s yes and speech recognition .	IS1001b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
825.38	So maybe we we can have a speech recognition in .	IS1001b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
420.34	Or say let's lose rubber , take plastic .	TS3012d.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
478.74	We can put those to the to the other covers .	TS3012d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
566.3	Perhaps we should make m 	TS3012d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
575.94	Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost .	TS3012d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
619.23	We could at least m uh make it like this , like you said , and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know .	TS3012d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1154.31	Think about 	TS3012d.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1585.56	You have to finish it completely , then download it , it's then start a new one .	TS3012d.C.words.xml	download	[]	[]	[]
1723.45	Okay , bring out the beer .	TS3012d.C.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
2007.84	I would lose the C. and just name it triple R. .	TS3012d.C.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[C., R.]
2098.61	See you in a minute .	TS3012d.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
2181.04	I'll put it back in a minute .	TS3012d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
344.18	make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard .	ES2013b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
406.31	And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television , D.V.D. , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy .	ES2013b.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
480.02	So an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question .	ES2013b.D.words.xml	pay	[]	[]	[]
501.28	find out information about speech recognition .	ES2013b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
507.45	the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control .	ES2013b.D.words.xml	pay	[]	[]	[]
548.45	I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
569.72	But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an that's a that's a very good question .	ES2013b.D.words.xml	pay	[]	[]	[]
644.1	remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray .	ES2013b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Osbournes, Ozzy, Osbourne]
1003.71	Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1409.75	Do we have um 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1590.49	So if you can dock it , um you know , you could s argue that this is 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	argue	[]	[]	[]
1634.45	Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate .	ES2013b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Kate]
1696.83	to go for the the manufacturers .	ES2013b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1745.62	Do we need um let me 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1815.62	well if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter um so you press power after you've um well I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice .	ES2013b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2077.73	Um and you'd mentioned I I was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements , because it they were it has to be for a T.V. , just to keep myself 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	reiterate	[]	[]	[T.V.]
329.94	Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by .	ES2003d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
396.81	Put it mildly .	ES2003d.C.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
417.72	If we imagine it's actually straight , and just give it a a score .	ES2003d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
495.0	Yeah you can tell what room the mobile is 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
546.9	What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[cr]
605.15	And we can come back to it , you said .	ES2003d.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1162.33	joystick .	ES2003d.C.words.xml	joystick	[]	[]	[]
1206.05	Oh , wait a minute .	ES2003d.C.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1380.92	Think we're being generous here with three .	ES2003d.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1392.02	Reduce the number of unused buttons .	ES2003d.C.words.xml	Reduce	[]	[]	[]
1420.91	And we could do whatever we like with the L. L.C.D. .	ES2003d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[L., L.C.D.]
1481.66	I might go as far as two on that .	ES2003d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1576.02	Could we stretch no still , it's not shaped like a banana is 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	stretch	[]	[]	[]
1596.14	Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well .	ES2003d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1645.56	Might we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1754.79	Even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven , we were to go down a grade to to four , we would have to do I mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic .	ES2003d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2148.77	Yeah , to begin with .	ES2003d.C.words.xml	begin	[]	[]	[]
56.23	Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least .	ES2005a.D.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
427.22	Yeah , I w I would suggest that too .	IB4001.D.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[]
587.85	Can reserve it for meetings .	IB4001.D.words.xml	reserve	[]	[]	[]
955.36	Yeah , and you can look outside of the window if you have a sh quick meeting there .	IB4001.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1157.96	Because w we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes .	IB4001.D.words.xml	place	[]	[]	[]
1162.92	Then we could have Gisella and the two fifty per cent people sharing the three 	IB4001.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1310.17	Okay , we should write this down .	IB4001.D.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
105.46	So I'll discuss them with you .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
442.48	Yeah , I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
811.54	Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[cho]
842.81	So maybe we can put that on the bottom .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
901.34	But uh we we can switch those two , yeah .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
992.34	If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1136.79	Yeah , we could do that .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1143.56	Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1148.92	So you can still th look through it .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1257.26	Yeah , but we can still make it transparent .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1350.57	Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1383.83	Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1406.43	Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1426.96	Uh but with three D. uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[D.]
1456.94	We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1477.73	Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1541.13	Yeah , you can make it curved or mm round .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1717.77	Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1766.63	Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1817.89	So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1924.32	Yeah , so top down .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	top	[]	[]	[]
2006.99	Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh As long as it isn is in two D. we can use all kind of round shapes .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[D.]
2048.48	Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2054.37	I would do it 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2250.59	Yeah , we could do that .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2375.62	Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost .	TS3004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
40.93	standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
51.94	The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	rubbery	[]	[]	[]
68.12	Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
103.25	Make sure the camera's 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
109.95	Wait a second , I'll get it out .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
125.4	You should have one of those things and you can just take it off .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
233.26	So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , 'cause it's the top part that's okay .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
342.35	Yeah , that would make sense .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
584.38	Just write small .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
637.05	I would agree .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1115.56	that the screen will go blank , 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1137.15	See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1250.74	See , it says case material .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1278.4	Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1283.57	Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1489.17	We can do it some other way , we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1493.09	We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1500.37	You could choose to have that or not .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1547.48	make the price fit , and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , because it also sets it apart from the crowd .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1992.06	But people could have anything that they wanted .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2075.14	Do you think that's takes into account um 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2099.95	So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at .	ES2004d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
659.41	Um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down .	ES2014b.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
666.1	Um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button .	ES2014b.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
724.82	Could maybe do with some more colour .	ES2014b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
935.21	But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels .	ES2014b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Cable, Sky]
1311.52	Do a lot of um 	ES2014b.C.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
1708.85	'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it .	ES2014b.C.words.xml	solve	[]	[]	[]
1938.45	Yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well .	ES2014b.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2120.53	Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby .	ES2014b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
583.38	Open .	IS1002b.C.words.xml	Open	[]	[]	[]
605.39	what I found is we want to do fashion and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design .	IS1002b.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
618.07	If basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad 	IS1002b.C.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[]
631.49	So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at .	IS1002b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
637.3	And um although mo most people will buy s 	IS1002b.C.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[mo]
665.91	um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics .	IS1002b.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
682.67	Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , but um we should go for the 	IS1002b.C.words.xml	remove	[]	[]	[]
770.8	Yeah and now you can c look it over Internet .	IS1002b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
852.39	Yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so 	IS1002b.C.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
858.87	One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs .	IS1002b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1015.27	No just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands .	IS1002b.C.words.xml	advocate	[]	[]	[]
1020.83	Um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas .	IS1002b.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
2032.88	Uh we should keep it simple , mm medium-low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good .	IS1002b.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
606.55	You can put the R. and R. .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[R., R.]
675.91	I will go next .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
691.8	Uh how it should look .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
747.87	Um perhaps it's useful , perhaps for because people um lose the remote , they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	yell	[]	[]	[]
757.64	And perhaps we could uh implement that .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	implement	[]	[]	[]
824.26	So could call it settings or something .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
854.48	and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1005.27	Let's build it into a sponge .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1094.34	You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1107.09	Perhaps you could find something in the middle .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1127.47	wait , like like this uh a bit .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1224.04	Yeah think uh Also in between .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1269.07	Uh did you have something about uh 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1273.72	So we should first decide about shape , I think .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1276.41	Which uh Then you can fit the L.C.D. screen in it , and can decide uh .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1331.12	But if you pu Now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1395.85	Y you could include a pen .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
1747.3	At least uh what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1867.16	Yeah but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
1957.88	And the the pay the the the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1989.39	This concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place a 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
2009.1	But then you should also find a place You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2015.55	You can talk into the corner .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
2040.31	but you should uh decide where you want to put it .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
2052.38	You could p you could put it in a logo of the company .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2154.3	Yeah the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
2235.02	You should you should have a black one because uh I think black is standard .	TS3005c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2311.74	And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2346.28	But do we have to We'll work together , but do we have to stay here , or do we 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
167.58	Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together .	ES2006a.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
181.63	Um and then the detailed design will come after that .	ES2006a.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
186.88	We'll pull it all together .	ES2006a.C.words.xml	pull	[]	[]	[]
262.97	Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard .	ES2006a.C.words.xml	introduce	[]	[]	[]
279.87	So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project .	ES2006a.C.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
473.99	Excellent , to match the rabbit .	ES2006a.C.words.xml	match	[]	[]	[]
957.83	Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that 	ES2006a.C.words.xml	do	[twelve and a half Euro]	[]	[]
1236.66	Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .	ES2006a.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1278.36	Carry the laptops back again .	ES2006a.C.words.xml	Carry	[]	[]	[]
558.04	Uh so perhaps we can go to the to the f to the first movie .	IB4011.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
668.42	But I would expect it .	IB4011.C.words.xml	expect	[]	[]	[]
669.49	I would expect it .	IB4011.C.words.xml	expect	[]	[]	[]
671.07	Okay , so if you can go to the 	IB4011.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
686.15	And to remember as well , yeah .	IB4011.C.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
1038.37	Uh so and it's really it's uh the user comments say it's a deep , wonderful , penetrating uh film , extraordinary uh irony uh in a psychological drama about American life , and I can fully agree with this user comment .	IB4011.C.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1118.16	If would like to go for something what is really serious I would definitely uh go for Schindler's List , and if not uh then 	IB4011.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Schindler]
1681.56	So doing nothing , just uh take it easy in the life , yeah .	IB4011.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1859.81	So perhaps we can somehow combine them .	IB4011.C.words.xml	combine	[]	[]	[]
2042.17	Let's nominate , okay .	IB4011.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2047.06	So I will take basically two extremes , I will take Schindler's List and I will take uh The Big Lebowski .	IB4011.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[Schindler, Big, Lebowski]
2163.99	Yeah , but then each of us will will uh but then each of us will vote for uh our nominees , so I would propose to to to vote for s sun uh to to give the points to the to the movies that were not nominated by you .	IB4011.C.words.xml	vote	[]	[]	[]
2229.21	okay , and I wi I will give one to The Big Lebowski and two to The uh uh Shawshank Redemption .	IB4011.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[Big, Lebowski, Shawshank, Redemption]
2357.16	And perhaps we will have some new members .	IB4011.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
36.66	Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards .	IS1002d.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
69.35	Let's try and keep this one on schedule .	IS1002d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
320.92	Hang on .	IS1002d.A.words.xml	Hang	[]	[]	[]
361.91	But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides .	IS1002d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
779.57	Okay so we can talk about finance now .	IS1002d.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
892.16	Well hang on .	IS1002d.A.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[]
947.11	presentation , where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell 	IS1002d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[Paul, Paul]
1038.96	Uh no yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , but the uh 	IS1002d.A.words.xml	break	[]	[]	[]
1080.24	What did we think of the meeting room , I guess is an important thing here .	IS1002d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1107.31	Keep it , keep it calm .	IS1002d.A.words.xml	Keep	[]	[]	[]
1133.63	I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day , but see these look like they're that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down .	IS1002d.A.words.xml	wh	[]	[]	[]
1207.4	Oh hang on it really that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros .	IS1002d.A.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[Euros]
1223.83	Mm I think so yeah , then celebration as it says .	IS1002d.A.words.xml	celebration	[]	[]	[]
44.88	So welcome back .	TS3007b.A.words.xml	welcome	[]	[]	[]
63.24	I will uh take minutes and will put uh the minutes that I have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder .	TS3007b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
71.54	Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that uh now or afterwards .	TS3007b.A.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
1013.3	warn you .	TS3007b.A.words.xml	warn	[]	[]	[]
1912.65	Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something , so they don't uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television , so you must uh the the the the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television .	TS3007b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[wanna]
2050.34	Just build it in .	TS3007b.A.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
2328.27	Uh I will put my minutes uh I have updated them so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too .	TS3007b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2341.16	Uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email .	TS3007b.A.words.xml	receive	[]	[]	[]
2482.73	I'm hungry , so do it after lunch .	TS3007b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
10.41	Do you want to replace existing file , no .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
47.71	Yeah , but I've ta uh right , I'll just re-do it .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	re	[]	[]	[]
351.06	is quickly find that uh 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
429.97	But So the so the real w the real question then would come in .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
437.29	Do you make all the buttons 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
494.22	Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
529.81	if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
536.91	We'd have one special colour and one special button form .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
591.83	if we just did special Sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
616.18	that would work out fine if uh 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
655.4	Well , hold on .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
672.29	But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the Oh , I see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
697.18	And go for battery instead .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
698.66	That would give you one less .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
751.49	Remember that was a minimum requirement .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
806.88	Okay , but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
956.46	Go for one .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1061.81	Well , wait a minute .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1062.41	In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1120.0	And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , which would be come from the button supplements category .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1164.56	That that that would make the significant difference .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1166.94	You could either you could have it If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1182.74	So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	fiddle	[]	[]	[]
1188.59	And that would enable you to to do it .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	enable	[]	[]	[]
1262.52	The next on Well , I can just sing about .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	sing	[]	[]	[]
1266.66	I would go for a one on that at this point in time .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1385.5	Right , come on .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1434.94	Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
1469.17	So , you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1609.66	Yeah , I would agree with that , I think .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1667.98	So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1735.91	Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you're making a red apple .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	argue	[]	[]	[]
1742.57	So next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	make	[next year, next year's]	[]	[]
1835.5	How it would play out , yeah .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1948.72	You could put in another Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2119.48	Until the design team comes in and says , get off .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2359.6	I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which I will do .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2451.57	You then go and change things around , and then go back .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2512.35	example pel to increase create 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
2597.95	And then you or the idea is that the whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or uh or or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[Joe, Bloggs]
2652.54	New ideas found , did we find any , no .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2698.25	To uh go uh reasonably well .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2777.16	However , um Alright uh means , so whiteboard um so really , it's uh equipment .	ES2014d.A.words.xml	whiteboard	[]	[]	[]
180.16	In the functional design phase I'm I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on .	ES2016a.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
486.28	Do we want it to last longer or rather have people 	ES2016a.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
761.89	One problem you'd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part .	ES2016a.B.words.xml	roll	[]	[]	[]
1256.53	So , have to m 	ES2016a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1269.91	O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so .	ES2016a.B.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[]
1275.85	Course you can do that .	ES2016a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1302.92	Otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work .	ES2016a.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1351.04	Let's .	ES2016a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
64.08	Um mm , okay , so basically I'll start off by uh I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
93.03	Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
171.57	So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[ge]
274.38	But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	lie	[]	[]	[]
292.34	Okay um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	list	[]	[]	[]
357.47	Um the so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment , so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
381.97	For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
396.48	we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
431.78	And L.C.D.s , we can have L.C.D.s .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[L.C.D.s, L.C.D.s]	[]
456.51	The P.C.B. is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[P.C.B.]
535.19	So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
560.32	Okay , so th that's that's basically now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important , yeah .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
629.67	Yeah , it should should do it .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
931.88	So instead of going down you just spin yeah , yeah .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	spin	[]	[]	[]
954.84	So maybe I should include that here as well , L.C.D.s um plus spinning .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	include	[]	[L.C.D.s]	[]
1235.61	Go on .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1287.16	Yeah , we we have we have rubber , but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1336.31	Yeah , tap it on the desk , yeah .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	tap	[]	[]	[]
1466.24	Um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal , but uh 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	seem	[]	[]	[]
1476.46	As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1583.52	Oh , if if we have L.C.D. displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L.C.D. display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L.C.D. display .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[L.C.D., L.C.D., L.C.D.]
1674.04	Okay , so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1790.76	I'll rub that out .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	rub	[]	[]	[]
1798.1	Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1842.22	Um okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1865.35	So I'll rub off the other two .	ES2006c.A.words.xml	rub	[]	[]	[]
194.66	Okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal .	IS1004a.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
201.67	Let's see .	IS1004a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
248.07	and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions .	IS1004a.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
264.31	And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else .	IS1004a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
603.79	We can discuss that off-line .	IS1004a.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
642.17	So could I just ask one question , um 	IS1004a.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
0.95	You know , I I want everything and then I'll decide what I want .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
38.5	We can get back to it .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
40.27	We can get we can always get back to it .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
50.34	We'll still have the original and a method of uh of filtering .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
73.31	Because the worst thing that can ever happen to you is you discover that you've done huge amounts of analysis and th you actually had the data but you threw it away because you treated it so grossly .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	discover	[]	[]	[]
83.04	So whatever we should be able to b you know , backtrack and say okay instead of every second , every tenth of a second or some such thing .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	backtrack	[]	[]	[]
230.64	S so typically the eye will move , right .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
327.41	One one could imagine those two categories .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
439.6	Let's let's imagine a typical construction event , okay .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
484.73	Let's call it the c the construct , existing construct , which could be zero .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
534.4	So even so you wanna look at if we're interested in how long before the construction move takes place , um how much of the time they spend looking at the same thing .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[wanna]
544.62	Let's call that our measure of alignment .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
571.37	Temporarily simplify too much , so that yeah .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	simplify	[]	[]	[]
684.85	If if your intention is to move the red triangle to sit on top of the thing already constructed , you would tend to look back and forth .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	tend	[]	[]	[]
815.63	We'd expect that if we put people under time pressure they'll look at the clock a lot more .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	expect	[]	[]	[]
823.54	So so you can define if all of these things are actually categorised by the eye tracker as to where the eye is , alright , you should be able to pull out any interesting category and say alright for this phase it's T.R. one , or C. .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	define	[]	[T.R.]	[C.]
926.82	So I should talk to him about this .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
933.41	So I w I'll bring this one back to him .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
961.43	So they may well have a yeah .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
966.83	Let's find out .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
972.16	So wha right .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[]
988.19	But um so they'll they'll uh they'll tell us something about that .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1148.15	You could get the entire chunking of the task out of a language .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1316.05	We will jiggle around in there .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	jiggle	[]	[]	[]
1544.7	You can come back .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1838.98	So imagine that we've just added a piece to the construct , alright .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1855.69	So at that point you should have a line-up of A. is on the construct , A. is on the mouse , A. is on A. is on A.'s mouse , A. is on B.'s mouse , A. is on B.'s gaze , and B. likewise .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[A., A., A., A., B., A., B., B.]
2147.73	The gaze will wobble .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	wobble	[]	[]	[]
2149.3	The gaze will wobble .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	wobble	[]	[]	[]
2288.73	Yeah , it is big , and you do have to scroll through it to see what's going on .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2295.49	But so we'd we'd better do a test one and and listen to them scream .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2378.28	Because when you add another part , construct one ceases to exist and you get construct two , right .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	construct	[]	[]	[]
2418.19	'Cause you can build sub-assemblies .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
2420.35	And then you can start again .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
2476.55	So we could we could essentially well , then we could cumulati or it is a new construct 'cause it has a new list of a new cumulative list of parts , right .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	cumulati	[]	[]	[]
2591.32	Suppose we pick up an we we we screwed up the first time we put the triangle with the square and we threw it away and decided we didn't like it , and we took another one .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
2701.32	So wai hang on .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[wai]
2921.97	Um does it s keep its identity .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
2971.8	I mean suppose I can't talk to you and I'm doing this task with you and I can't talk to you .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	suppose	[]	[]	[]
2981.7	I can reach for the next thing and you can go where I reach .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
3070.85	Construct three , right , is a red triangle , a green square and another red triangle .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	Construct	[]	[]	[]
3077.85	Construct four okay .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	Construct	[]	[]	[]
3109.84	So we could zip we could zip through this and look at all the um all the interactions in which people build sub-construct contstructs first which we expect them to do bu as a wild hypothesis more when they have verbal communication than when they don't , okay .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	zip	[]	[]	[]
3126.55	And we can do that by simply searching for any constructs that have constructs as children .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
3197.48	I but it does have replacement .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3274.14	Because they'll if they're gonna do it by gesture they'll build up a convention , right .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
3292.79	Suppose they start off with language and then they they say hey look , you know , let's do it like this .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
3300.26	I just I just wanna make sure that a wish list , yes .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[wanna]
3334.77	They could just screw up .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	screw	[]	[]	[]
3344.51	Let's just throw that away and start again , yeah .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
3373.2	Oh yeah , well do you know which which which which one was the top right .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
3519.73	Check out 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	Check	[]	[]	[]
3572.11	Because you can certainly mix things .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	mix	[]	[]	[]
3583.91	We do almost always want to use them in exactly in parallel .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
3615.7	So that we'd have to re-align them .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3679.86	So they'll include things like the um the eye tracker calibration , right , which is not a bad thing actually .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
3687.7	Because sometimes you wanna go back and find out if this was just a particularly duff subject .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[duff]
3827.81	Have to really question .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
3859.02	And then then they can do sound analysis on that .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	sound	[]	[]	[]
3959.3	So we there's gonna be a way to , sooner or later , to align the eye track , Camtasia one , Camtasia two with two sound channels .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	align	[]	[Camtasia, Camtasia]	[]
4058.13	When you decide it's all over , does it ping you back and 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	ping	[]	[]	[]
4144.64	Do you have a powered microphone or something .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
4301.28	But you'll hear more choice language at the point when we've all done a lot of work and and then we discover we can't use the session because of some thing we didn't think about .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	hear	[]	[]	[]
4474.58	Okay , so when you I mean uh given that there are these events recorded , we can use any of them as the beginning of any of them as a start point , for example , right .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
4541.03	I I'd before we break up for lunch I just wanna make sure that tha that I know how long it's gonna be before we're in run mode , okay .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
4581.47	Um scoring shape overlap , no problem .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	overlap	[]	[]	[]
4701.68	But if um if everybody has a lot to do and , you know , Joe could give it a couple of hours , which i is what it might take just to fix it , then let's do it because starting run-time is now getting to be fairly urgent .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[Joe]
4823.79	Or do you have a specific thing that okay .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
4897.1	Um so we can change that .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
4922.08	Alright , maybe w should get on there and book mornings as far as the eye can see .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
5012.6	You have we have to build the things .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
5033.19	First pilot subjects , the ones who um know which questions we wanna ask .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
5037.1	And then we should get another pair who are naive to the whole thing .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
5054.35	Well um because actually we can I mean uh , you know , if we make comments , they feed back in a lo into the development .	EN2009d.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1223.8	So what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R.C. a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you .	IS1000c.D.words.xml	explain	[]	[R.C.]	[]
1314.18	So you finding , just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key , and uh uh that's , with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um .	IS1000c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1356.65	And uh so I think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V. V.L.S.I. or F.P.G.A. uh high technology , and this is important , and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them .	IS1000c.D.words.xml	use	[]	[V.L.S.I., F.P.G.A.]	[V., fi]
1502.47	So to to sum up um 	IS1000c.D.words.xml	sum	[]	[]	[]
1622.66	Exactly yeah that's a very good idea , we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle , uh it's called F.P.G.A. chip , that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh L.C.D. and yeah .	IS1000c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[F.P.G.A.]	[L.C.D.]
2067.86	Yeah and find maybe a compromise .	IS1000c.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
537.99	To make it a little bit easier .	TS3005a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
568.45	Yeah , the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , it can reach everything .	TS3005a.D.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[charis]
890.34	Yeah , okay , that's possible , but it'll get very big the the remote control .	TS3005a.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
925.78	Yeah , play , pause , stop .	TS3005a.D.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1016.07	Standard deliver .	TS3005a.D.words.xml	deliver	[]	[]	[]
1075.11	You can use which which type of television you have .	TS3005a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1065.75	Well , if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well .	ES2012c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1080.72	So it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like like like like a cog or something .	ES2012c.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1134.72	I dunno if it depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , I dunno , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , and then you could control the buttons with your fingers .	ES2012c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1230.12	the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy , look and feel 	ES2012c.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1321.92	Yeah , we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and 	ES2012c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1355.44	With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out .	ES2012c.D.words.xml	buy	[one every year]	[]	[]
1663.19	And make that a fashion symbol as well .	ES2012c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1799.15	Yeah , maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice .	ES2012c.D.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
1882.94	Well I mean on a onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button .	ES2012c.D.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
1966.35	Uh can I just get some things clear just for my sake .	ES2012c.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
836.79	Thank you , just pull it closer a little bit .	ES2004b.D.words.xml	pull	[]	[]	[]
841.71	Get it right over , okay , thank you .	ES2004b.D.words.xml	Get	[]	[]	[]
896.95	Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking .	ES2004b.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
917.9	For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping .	ES2004b.D.words.xml	zap	[]	[]	[sofa]
934.54	Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control .	ES2004b.D.words.xml	cut	[]	[]	[]
983.56	You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems .	ES2004b.D.words.xml	lead	[]	[]	[]
1370.01	Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def 	ES2004b.D.words.xml	appeal	[]	[]	[]
1522.11	Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on 	ES2004b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1530.2	a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later .	ES2004b.D.words.xml	broaden	[]	[]	[]
1723.2	Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T.V. remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones .	ES2004b.D.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[T.V., Carphone, Warehouse]
2067.8	I mean look at the mobile .	ES2004b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2095.7	Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think .	ES2004b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2108.8	I think it's a really nice idea and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic , you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior .	ES2004b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2167.99	Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything .	ES2004b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2322.73	Whoops , questionnaire four .	ES2004b.D.words.xml	questionnaire	[]	[]	[Whoops]
201.08	And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
213.75	Sure uh just pop in at any time .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	pop	[]	[]	[]
320.14	So we could cancel that one .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	cancel	[]	[]	[]
359.3	leave out the number buttons I guess .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
731.67	If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
782.97	We we could save money on it .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
845.37	The margin will get too small .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1026.12	Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
1227.25	We could make two buttons out of that .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1234.33	If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[]
1239.89	So that would save two buttons .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1285.75	If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1291.9	And make it smaller overall .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2081.14	The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy .	TS3003d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1177.65	Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control .	ES2006b.B.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
1203.47	Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly .	ES2006b.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1222.52	Okay , well , I can send it to all of you .	ES2006b.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1382.46	Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T.V. , you know , tends to be people talking and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T.V. .	ES2006b.B.words.xml	wonder	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
1442.95	Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit .	ES2006b.B.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[]
1606.53	Do you want me to 	ES2006b.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1691.99	I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really .	ES2006b.B.words.xml	pay	[fifteen to twenty five year olds]	[]	[]
1720.73	No , do totally .	ES2006b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1774.23	y you'd maybe need a code word .	ES2006b.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1922.39	It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah .	ES2006b.B.words.xml	yell	[]	[]	[]
36.66	Then I'll move this one .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
42.07	Oh no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
90.85	And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	afford	[]	[]	[]
491.69	Well it might work one time , huh .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
843.06	Yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1018.11	Remember .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
1060.64	Dissatisfy younger people .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	Dissatisfy	[]	[]	[]
1305.31	look on that .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1355.73	Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes , and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1375.48	No , uh count uh number of functions , because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots , so or different different screens , so 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	count	[]	[]	[]
1395.35	We'll wait .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1431.49	I'll just fill it in .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	fill	[]	[]	[]
1563.03	Yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
1567.53	And then you can keep the curve .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1578.54	Or make it on a hand dynamo , but I don't think that will work .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1774.28	Because of thing Yeah , well you can at least make it curved again .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1853.45	Okay , but this this new remote we can afford .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	afford	[]	[]	[]
1905.08	Oh , you can arrange 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	arrange	[]	[]	[]
1927.32	Select none .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	Select	[]	[]	[]
1934.74	Okay , and now you can erase .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	erase	[]	[]	[]
1944.64	Well you can draw over it with white uh pen .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1980.85	Let's see , we can save this now .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1987.45	And move back to here .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
2014.39	Hey , but you can erase that .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	erase	[]	[]	[]
2031.03	Okay , well uh just leave it at this and quickly save .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
2069.29	And you could ask things .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
2101.05	Well , probably to simulate the whole working uh process , huh , th you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	simulate	[several weeks]	[]	[]
2251.29	Okay , and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point , the leadership .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	walk	[]	[]	[]
2434.64	Um okay well uh I just got my warning for the last five minutes , so I'll move on to I guess my last slide , yes , which is the closing .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
2461.0	Maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product , but we did that before , and we also evaluated the project .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	re	[]	[]	[]
2499.47	But maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this , so I can try to include it in the final report .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2510.24	I know , we should remove this , but it won't h 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	remove	[]	[]	[]
2513.65	And uh please put it in the project folder then , huh .	TS3005d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
320.45	Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
399.47	You could do do that .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
446.41	So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	require	[]	[]	[]
492.66	And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	avoid	[]	[]	[]
513.9	So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[circuit, board]
535.47	Um i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
606.17	We could do , yeah .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
655.22	And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	note	[]	[]	[]
672.62	So maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	cut	[]	[]	[]
719.25	Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
776.9	Okay , so we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
797.94	Yeah that makes sense , so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[simple, circuit, board]
843.38	So you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
912.0	Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1150.68	It w it would make it quite complicated , where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1273.11	So maybe we could have like 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1281.66	So maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1600.78	We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	imply	[]	[]	[]
1726.53	Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[Nokia]
1732.65	But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , whether that would just increase the costs , make it more complicated .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
1747.11	Yeah the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same , but you could change the the way it looked .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
1856.74	And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1953.28	it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as well .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2033.74	So shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , if we have to kind of 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2069.24	We'll go for single curve , yeah .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2167.99	We will go for the a a a apples apples .	ES2014c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
545.39	He does have body uh 	TS3007a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
815.12	Can work together .	TS3007a.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1361.09	Um one thing uh , we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make .	TS3007a.B.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1371.05	Or uh We should have some agreement on that before we 	TS3007a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1570.08	Come up .	TS3007a.B.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
190.21	You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed , um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
322.39	Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
361.57	So um and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	cover	[]	[]	[]
413.1	Um okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and L.C.D. display , or multiple scrolling wheels .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	u	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
639.54	That I would believe .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	believe	[]	[]	[]
696.45	Instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	stop	[]	[]	[]
964.26	Function-wise , what does that do that 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1013.17	I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but I mean I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1040.24	No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1200.21	Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1383.62	But we I we will need a receiver , an antenna .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1545.17	Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T.V.s won't re the T.V.s won't respond exactly the same .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[T.V.s, T.V.s]
1552.47	Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	queue	[]	[]	[]
1647.94	Well , what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels , and it c it 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	roll	[]	[]	[]
1660.67	It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T.V. .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1670.27	You say programme start , and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1677.51	So programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter , programme end .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	enter	[]	[]	[]
1893.72	Then you could probably afford this .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	afford	[]	[]	[]
1958.91	It might look like clay .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2005.67	We'll let you know when we're done , if we can go earlier .	IS1002c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
181.91	I'll start off then .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
316.34	Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
335.2	Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	blend	[]	[]	[]
342.26	Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
347.97	Just keep it simple and Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
379.01	So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
390.85	So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
402.66	Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	advise	[]	[]	[]
1033.72	get great popularity for our product .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1038.44	Um wel 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	wel	[]	[]	[]
1044.23	Yeah you could load up the batteries , you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
1137.34	'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	allow	[]	[]	[]
1159.13	asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	pay	[]	[]	[]
1168.27	So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
1173.92	I would greatly advise not to do it .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	advise	[]	[]	[]
1193.12	Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
1202.5	And on top of that the L.C.D. screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1462.46	We would have to look carefully into the design though .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1468.87	'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1496.55	Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
1502.37	one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1562.64	So we can pretty much just do whatever we want .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1578.46	No just to lie down .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	lie	[]	[]	[]
1581.25	We'll go for that .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1681.79	Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1693.96	But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	yield	[]	[]	[]
2146.73	And I'd prefer the corners to be round .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
2151.01	Think that would be better .	TS3003c.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
76.8	Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , so instead we've um this is gonna be an L.C.D. screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm 	ES2002d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
291.94	Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons .	ES2002d.D.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
314.2	Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and 	ES2002d.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
573.89	Well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits .	ES2002d.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
813.63	See , about that thick .	ES2002d.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1770.93	Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .	ES2002d.D.words.xml	reckon	[]	[]	[]
1775.97	If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier .	ES2002d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2314.66	Guess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells .	ES2002d.D.words.xml	Guess	[]	[]	[Play, Doh]
339.824	Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels .	TS3011d.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
428.35400000000004	Fancy look and feel .	TS3011d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
439.254	Uh well appar 	TS3011d.D.words.xml	appar	[]	[]	[]
1069.764	Uh I'll go uh for the two .	TS3011d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1260.494	So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .	TS3011d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1402.3339999999998	Um I think think a one , 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um 	TS3011d.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
2082.7039999999997	Oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling .	TS3011d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
67.94	Skip it .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	Skip	[]	[]	[]
479.88	Uh r b well we can still test whether Camtasia runs anyway .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	test	[]	[Camtasia]	[]
1117.12	When people just uh if they can log on to it can book it .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	book	[]	[]	[]
1276.32	Uh I'll I'll do that .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1409.28	Well , I'll try and get ahold of her again today and see what 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	try	[today]	[]	[]
1552.31	Uh th they'll certainly be time because I'm right next to the lab anyway , I'll come back just to check my email and things anyway , so uh yeah .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
2127.78	Norman normally uh would be just , as I say , like add the blink time and duration to the previous fixation .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[Norman]
2153.97	Yes , so that they'll include the 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
2197.3	Know what to look for and what not to , yeah .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	Know	[]	[]	[]
2216.1	The software that I've used uh p pools uh the blinks , so will add it on .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
2438.4	Although we'll also still need a count of the fixations just so we can have you you've got measure fixation duration again just to s see if those they spend longer just f amount of more stable move uh eye fixation or not .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2541.31	Um well the N.X.T. stuff will have the more complete picture 'cause it will include combine all the linguistic stuff with all the movements and the actions .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[N.X.T.]
2645.49	Uh because that little utility um does things like t well but you can tell it to what to do with blinks , whether just to lump them in or or not .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
2655.6	Uh what the minimum fixation duration for a stable fixation would be , sort of you have if it picks up t fixations less than say fifty milliseconds , you can tell it just to again lump them all together , that's not a sort of reliable enough fixation .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
2671.46	Uh you can put in these sort of of things .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2746.57	And it can stri it strips out a lot of the junk uh as well .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	stri	[]	[]	[]
2867.69	Lossiness .	EN2009c.C.words.xml	Lossiness	[]	[]	[]
115.54	The U.I. guy also uh work on that , yeah , and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs .	IS1004b.A.words.xml	work	[]	[U.I.]	[mar, Marketing, Expert]
137.97	So , I just put d quickly Remo , but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly .	IS1004b.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[Remo]
253.38	We should we should go to other for the other topics .	IS1004b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
272.99	So maybe we could start with the market , yeah .	IS1004b.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
710.75	So maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now .	IS1004b.A.words.xml	jump	[]	[]	[]
1456.78	Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide .	IS1004b.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1667.89	We should bring new technologies for young peoples , and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet .	IS1004b.A.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1703.53	and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies .	IS1004b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1710.3	Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T.V. in fact we can use T.V. screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have .	IS1004b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
1889.86	to browse more easily the teletext .	IS1004b.A.words.xml	browse	[]	[]	[]
75.09	See if I can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
78.88	Um I'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
93.77	Um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do , um and how it's going to do it hopefully .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
105.19	And uh then we'll have the closing .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
109.07	Um which we'll have forty minutes for .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
211.63	I'll hand it off to you and um 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	hand	[]	[]	[]
324.01	Oh hit F. eight again .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	hit	[]	[]	[F.]
329.51	And then it should come up 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
353.14	You could maybe minimise that screen and then 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	minimise	[]	[]	[]
356.51	have them both up at the same time I think .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
603.63	Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , what we should focus on .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
850.51	Focus on uh the i 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	Focus	[]	[]	[]
1269.65	Volume up .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	Volume	[]	[]	[]
1309.93	Let's see here .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1315.67	Trade you .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	Trade	[]	[]	[]
1369.47	Um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1388.71	And we could probably get away with black too but 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1445.5	So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1452.6	And that way we can focus on our form .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
1493.05	For you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1561.6	Um then we'll take lunch .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1564.07	Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1571.56	I'll do the minutes .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1636.92	Did you have time earlier to to work on that .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1772.8	Maybe we could sketch a so basically 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	sketch	[]	[]	[]
1789.4	Um maybe we could flare it or something .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	flare	[]	[]	[]
1806.73	go ahead and erase this .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1854.71	Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	defeat	[]	[]	[]
1889.45	Maybe we could go with a square or something .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1923.11	Channel up and down .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	Channel	[]	[]	[]
1954.15	If you , if we want the remote to do other things like um or I guess the T.V. to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T.V.s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.s]
2039.14	Look g yeah .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
2325.33	So for the next um before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on you're watching trends to see what what kind of new information we've got going on .	ES2016b.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
2345.86	Let's go with our our uh rounded 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
46.13	Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	move	[today]	[]	[]
56.46	And then we'll move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
82.14	First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
117.18	Um introduce yourself , um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	introduce	[]	[]	[]
416.73	Let's see .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
417.85	Let's see , let's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
490.42	Okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so 	ES2008a.A.words.xml	generate	[]	[]	[]
666.65	Um I would imagine all of them , but we could but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A.s .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
814.17	I'll look into that .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
891.62	I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um , 	ES2008a.A.words.xml	continue	[]	[]	[]
918.09	Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
935.78	And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
996.44	Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	type	[]	[]	[Mm]
1012.03	I'll just attach it to an email .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	attach	[]	[]	[]
1032.66	Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1039.88	Let me see if I can do that right now .	ES2008a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
551.03	Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
628.74	And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	last	[]	[]	[]
695.82	Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
872.2	Okay , well I'll move on .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
874.85	Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P.C.B. board which pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L.E.D. in the sequence of l on and off bursts .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	connect	[]	[]	[P.C.B., circuit, board, L.E.D.]
943.54	If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	s	[]	[]	[]
976.66	Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T.V. remote , but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1024.6	the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1032.5	Titanium um very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	make	[this year]	[]	[]
1094.17	If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1168.63	And you can peel them off yeah .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	peel	[]	[]	[]
1204.82	Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare P.C.B. circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[P.C.B., circuit, board]
1279.4	with the L.C.D. , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[circuit, board]
1292.64	You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , but I'm just wondering whether we want an L.C.D. screen inside .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1341.3	Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but I I think they could get a bit easily lost , 'cause I had 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1393.63	Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1469.38	I mean you can you could do it , you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L.C.D. display it'll completely blank it out , but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1635.08	Yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[li]
1865.0	Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one , I mean they use them in calculators so .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	s	[]	[]	[]
1899.26	K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch .	ES2004c.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
374.17	We can have have a whole menagerie .	ES2014a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
517.07	So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog .	ES2014a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
522.43	You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired .	ES2014a.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
851.7	And um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room .	ES2014a.D.words.xml	defeat	[]	[]	[]
862.88	So whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote .	ES2014a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
957.14	So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo , and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well , maybe .	ES2014a.D.words.xml	link	[]	[]	[]
97.41	So that's the first goal , decide for a movie to be projected , and second goal is to uh discuss for an ad advertising poster um for our um uh club , because we noticed that n last time not enough people came to the projection .	IB4010.D.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
901.14	Okay , The Usual Suspect , do we want to say something again about it , or 	IB4010.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[Suspect]
962.29	Do we have something to add on this movie , or 	IB4010.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1310.06	That's it's it's probably begin 	IB4010.D.words.xml	begin	[]	[]	[]
1995.56	At the end , to tell you the truth , I didn't like so much the movie because it was quite moralistic , because there were a guy who was who didn't kill German because he was quite non-violent .	IB4010.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
2400.64	And we can have annual subscrip subscription of sixty Francs .	IB4010.D.words.xml	have	[annual]	[]	[Francs]
2647.83	I would nominate uh 	IB4010.D.words.xml	nominate	[]	[]	[]
2709.52	Or we can eliminate first one one movie each , and then we s and then we select .	IB4010.D.words.xml	eliminate	[]	[]	[]
2752.87	Me , I would remove Silence of the Lambs because I think it's too violent .	IB4010.D.words.xml	remove	[]	[]	[Silence, Lambs]
2843.88	Okay , so I'll go with The Big Lebowski , since the posters are already ready .	IB4010.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Big, Lebowski]
2898.23	Okay , o or we'll decide after the projection of the movie the date .	IB4010.D.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
55.46	And do you think it's .	IS1000d.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
125.77	Um , can we have a phone , can someone 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
224.96	So I will start by the the basic one that uh 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
230.92	fits into uh eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros , and uh well first for both they have um a special shape , maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , but uh it's like a surf board .	IS1000d.C.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
490.71	Play , pause .	IS1000d.C.words.xml	Play	[]	[]	[]
678.42	Well I think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
1124.3	Try a 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
1188.66	Oh you can push push it again , you can push it .	IS1000d.C.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
1316.24	And um with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part .	IS1000d.C.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
1340.39	Uh could put it at one or two I would say .	IS1000d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1406.24	So maybe we can put one .	IS1000d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1709.18	Uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie .	IS1000d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1786.63	'Cause sometimes look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , and uh it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here .	IS1000d.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1798.59	So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things .	IS1000d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2214.81	Yeah but if you have the near the L.C.D. you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio , T.V. and V.C.R. , and this needs a needs a advanced chip .	IS1000d.C.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[uni, universal, T.V., V.C.R.]
2234.04	I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip .	IS1000d.C.words.xml	do	[today]	[]	[]
2342.61	So wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the L.C.D. , um 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
2468.92	Because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here .	IS1000d.C.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
120.82	And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , so they kinda just stretch over .	ES2012d.C.words.xml	stretch	[]	[]	[people'll, wanna, iPod]
156.88	just kinda stretch it over 	ES2012d.C.words.xml	stretch	[]	[]	[]
159.74	and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R.R. .	ES2012d.C.words.xml	stay	[]	[R.R.]	[]
226.39	Or just make it little .	ES2012d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
249.1	fall over .	ES2012d.C.words.xml	fall	[]	[]	[]
54.83	Send .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	Send	[]	[]	[]
152.0	I'll go first .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
152.95	I'll go first yeah .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
221.15	Uh senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
436.08	And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1058.41	Uh yeah , think so .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1142.94	So perhaps we should we should focus on that L.C.D. screen .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1195.89	Yeah , we can make it possible to do that , yeah .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1231.25	if the i if the young people are interested in L.C.D. screens , we should make 'em .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
1300.77	Uh so if you uh Yeah , so if you uh you receive an email about that , uh can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in uh our projects mail uh folder .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	post	[]	[]	[]
1439.64	So uh you can mount uh the the the uh 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	mount	[]	[]	[]
1447.39	to refill the 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	refill	[]	[]	[]
1486.54	And go to standby mode when you don't use it , so that 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1619.92	Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points uh , or 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1641.33	Because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1666.24	Well , spread it by a big market .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	spread	[]	[]	[]
1683.33	Turn volume up .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	Turn	[]	[]	[]
1726.53	Let's hope uh to have some uh d 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1760.16	We should do it .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1952.52	I'll search um .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	search	[]	[]	[]
1954.98	If you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
2098.98	Okay , so use uh very uh lot of peo 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2105.0	Adjust with phones , yes 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	Adjust	[]	[]	[]
2129.19	Leave .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	Leave	[]	[]	[]
2262.95	Just tap it .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	tap	[]	[]	[]
2302.1	Yeah , because uh when you touch the L.C.D. screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	pop	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
2402.41	Yeah , think so .	TS3005b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
156.23	Mm-hmm but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
209.54	Uh the goal of the project I think maybe I'll uh hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting .	IS1008a.A.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[Ed]
386.22	Yeah , but uh before we talk about uh the finance , okay , uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also .	IS1008a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
533.53	okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need uh some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again .	IS1008a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
552.14	So , who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , so just let me know so I can uh coordinate all the teams .	IS1008a.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
663.98	Yes , that's you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay .	IS1008a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[Christine]
682.18	Then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company .	IS1008a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
696.53	Okay , so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan .	IS1008a.A.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
805.79	But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting , because uh he should know what's happening .	IS1008a.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[Ed, Christine]
815.83	Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so I need to submit to the management .	IS1008a.A.words.xml	copy	[]	[]	[]
843.81	To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , so then we can discuss about uh further things .	IS1008a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[Ed]
859.74	So , we'll meet when the we'll discuss on the further meeting .	IS1008a.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
886.8	And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email , or uh just come and uh knock my door , okay , so I'm available here .	IS1008a.A.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
384.63	so start 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
570.04	Do we have to uh 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
615.28	Oh b oh think this is uh 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
700.44	I'll save it alright uh save .	TS3009a.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
874.37	and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise .	TS3009a.C.words.xml	recognise	[]	[]	[]
975.19	yeah the shape will will have to be recognised .	TS3009a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1069.7	But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , but then you have 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1101.72	Well but it's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand , but it's it's still 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1143.1	to fit .	TS3009a.C.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1249.8	Yeah now we can still talk about the material , we have some some minutes left uh I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh .	TS3009a.C.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
1321.09	And have well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works .	TS3009a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
655.71	Um yeah I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
665.22	Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
672.85	But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
675.91	Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	program	[]	[]	[]
742.07	Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[]
753.8	Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T.V. , cable , satellite , V.C.R. , D.V.D. and audio .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	Store	[]	[]	[T.V., V.C.R.]
760.48	And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	record	[]	[]	[]
776.73	You can sort of just make those out .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
840.68	Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V. for volume .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[V.]
846.47	Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
859.3	Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[]
869.53	And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
906.91	Just to sort of show you .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
928.57	See .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1534.32	Would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1762.36	You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
1845.19	It could and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was .	ES2016c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
409.11	That we can discuss afterwards .	IS1004c.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
930.37	To have , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .	IS1004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[mm]
1249.97	So there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve .	IS1004c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1298.09	These are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve .	IS1004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1306.01	So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one , it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1461.7	Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing .	IS1004c.C.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
1478.89	Yeah , we can go to the next slide .	IS1004c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1488.57	So we can have regular chip for control .	IS1004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1548.68	Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better .	IS1004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1554.06	As or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , so that 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1568.76	We can go to the next slide .	IS1004c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1573.14	And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our T.V. remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V.C.R. D.V.D. players which are usually attached with the T.V. , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us .	IS1004c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V., V.C.R., T.V.]
1684.56	So you're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is .	IS1004c.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
2087.96	Because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons .	IS1004c.C.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
183.54	Shall I give a short introduction and then uh 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
195.55	Take it away .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
208.54	So , we've worked out this concepts , how to how to hold it , where to put the buttons and and stuff .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
443.08	It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable , so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
463.04	And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[Euros, noi, nice]
474.13	um I think a cover is necessary , 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L.C.D. screen .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
479.27	So , there must be some cheap standard cover , um maybe white or something , that's could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
807.39	But you could make a teletext button uh six .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
871.98	It'll make a difference .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
952.65	Um I would call uh choose two , 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours , as it would not .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
979.71	No , you can do two , because um it can be easier .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
984.12	But then you're l yeah , but then you'll lose function f yeah , functionality and our fancy uh look , so .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
1059.1	But uh , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh it's not an entire game .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1080.83	Th did you make this or the 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1265.17	Could you step a little to the right ma Yeah .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	step	[]	[]	[ma]
1286.1	Yeah , if if you're honest , we'll uh type one , special colour .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	type	[]	[]	[]
1337.08	Just cut off the kine yeah .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	cut	[]	[]	[]
1368.38	But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1454.9	Could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back , and then we're uh has 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1544.67	You ma can make an an especialised extra gold version .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[ma]
1626.17	We Yeah , we'll start her all o all over again .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1681.04	We could just sign up an uh remote if we liked .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	sign	[]	[]	[]
1734.61	You could of said , shut up you fool .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	shut	[]	[]	[]
1792.88	Yeah , but but draw something uh difficult .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1796.28	D uh just write your name right now .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1812.28	Just just write your name in in one line .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1863.27	As uh as I said a m a c few moments ago , it I would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must um 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1871.3	Yeah , it's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	sim	[]	[]	[]
1906.94	Yeah , it may um Yeah , and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size , yeah .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2051.07	People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it , and 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
2065.41	'Cause when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , and you do 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2126.95	Or maybe even insert picture .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	insert	[]	[]	[]
2168.09	You'll just make a link in 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2211.81	To use , yeah .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2232.86	You'll rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
2236.53	And th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there , just use a flip-board .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2541.79	Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
2599.96	He'll do it in his free time .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2620.3	You can ask your personal 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
2664.23	Oh , before you change anything maybe you um save it first .	TS3007d.B.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
591.86	We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , uh yeah , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness .	ES2008b.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
629.19	Oh , a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about 	ES2008b.C.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[]
644.49	h how well these particular prototypes work , uh sorta find out what people think of 'em .	ES2008b.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
661.19	Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment .	ES2008b.C.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
709.9	So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product .	ES2008b.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
728.23	In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them , uh what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em , um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls .	ES2008b.C.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
773.56	Yeah , it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your T.V. .	ES2008b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[T.V.]
784.39	It's just got the essential functions of the T.V. changing the channel , play , stop , volume .	ES2008b.C.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1237.77	I'll think of that every time now .	ES2008b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1487.49	'Cause that would affect the way that we market it .	ES2008b.C.words.xml	affect	[]	[]	[]
1659.8	So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down and there's all the all the special buttons .	ES2008b.C.words.xml	tune	[]	[]	[]
1885.11	Yeah aim for a an income group .	ES2008b.C.words.xml	aim	[]	[]	[]
2038.48	We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all .	ES2008b.C.words.xml	investigate	[]	[]	[]
715.76	this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product .	ES2006c.D.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
759.97	'S go back .	ES2006c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	['S]
858.29	Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever .	ES2006c.D.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
902.31	I I have a picture if you just a moment , I'll I'll show you .	ES2006c.D.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
915.17	Look , this one here .	ES2006c.D.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
971.29	Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen .	ES2006c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1590.07	But I th yeah but I think the L.C.D. display is kind of yeah , it's faster with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , but if you do want to use L.C.D. , then you flip it open , but it's it it's more time-consuming .	ES2006c.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[L.C.D., L.C.D.]
2070.58	So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L.C.D. , or would it be on the outer 	ES2006c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
304.67	Uh pla 	IS1002d.D.words.xml	pla	[]	[]	[]
324.16	So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town 	IS1002d.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
547.38	Help me .	IS1002d.D.words.xml	Help	[]	[]	[]
218.95	which I will show you .	TS3007b.D.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
342.61	First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .	TS3007b.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
376.46	Um , I will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done .	TS3007b.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
454.55	So uh , when you ask people , what do they use , 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
560.96	So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons , but if you don't use them , yeah it's 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
594.59	Just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .	TS3007b.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1233.91	channel switching , and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down .	TS3007b.D.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
2000.77	Add th that that's an opportunity .	TS3007b.D.words.xml	Add	[]	[]	[]
2155.05	No m may no , maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U.S.B. or a firewire connection , so that you can uh connect it to the P.C. and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet .	TS3007b.D.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[P.C.]	[U.S.B.]
2261.65	Let's vote .	TS3007b.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2396.12	Save as .	TS3007b.D.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
2404.0	But but you can open a from your pr from your laptop .	TS3007b.D.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
2408.76	Save as .	TS3007b.D.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
3.39	No , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
27.19	And then find it .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
363.41	we should plug it in .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	plug	[]	[]	[]
364.33	Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
370.08	We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
439.91	Well do we'll do it on the prototype , so do two , see how much it is .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
469.77	I think you just do one , don't you , for the 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
796.38	do .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
831.98	And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	finance	[]	[]	[]
839.75	And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
886.59	And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , so I'll go over here .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
903.2	So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1221.61	So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1332.86	Does it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1439.38	Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1529.07	Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	Lose	[]	[]	[]
1646.17	Okay , so tha 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	tha	[]	[]	[]
1673.29	So shall we do a Well , um 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1722.79	seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a a special form , so And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1732.59	And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well , I don't know .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1804.66	So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1820.7	Do you think 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2017.66	I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[wanna]
2084.09	I think well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2224.11	get it i in the 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2350.47	Finish your meeting now .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	Finish	[]	[]	[]
2434.29	You know , you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[]
2528.46	But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2662.66	we did find a new idea , I mean sort of a kinetic remote control .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2725.32	portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens , and uh I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in .	ES2014d.D.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
2735.33	Surely they they should produ 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	produ	[]	[]	[]
2864.25	To fill in these fill in these questionnaires 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	fill	[]	[]	[]
43.5	Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
49.25	Um well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
73.82	Um well , I'll show you the notes .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
81.98	We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
87.55	Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[dec]
104.55	And then we'll close again .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
109.61	Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
112.36	We'll first look at your uh presentations .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
249.62	We'll we'll look at uh .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
364.69	Nice , uh well show us .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
604.94	Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
609.52	So uh those kind of things you can you can combine .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	combine	[]	[]	[]
646.21	You you Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
780.08	We will take that .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
964.8	But then we should also have an uh an Okay button .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1077.83	Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1101.38	Or you can put in the L.C.D.'s uh window an option Get Out .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1182.68	I'd I agree .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1499.75	Titanium back , plastic front .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	Titanium	[]	[]	[]
1631.99	Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder , and then I'll put it in our end report .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1641.0	You can uh put some uh which button is what .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1668.52	We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	implement	[]	[]	[]
1691.89	Launch different lines at once .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	Launch	[]	[]	[]
1708.13	Come on .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
1735.85	Uh this fruit and bright colours , yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour , we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch , when we uh well introduce our remote .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	have	[the next uh half an hour]	[]	[]
1766.47	Well I'll have to , before I get another warning for five minutes , I'm going to get 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1828.6	Yes well we'll get it to hear that I think .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1848.09	So you'll get it on your em on your laptop .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1850.85	Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project yeah project evaluation .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1939.48	So we'll just have them uh standing there .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1963.8	Oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
2011.24	And well you c On the back , you can put uh h At the bottom , you can put the logo with the 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2039.63	No , you you can carve it into the titanium at the back .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	carve	[]	[]	[]
2208.75	Come on .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
2222.09	You'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop , and then uh you uh 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2255.73	So , you can uh draw a Yeah .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2260.45	Well I'll get a I'll get the message .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2272.29	Or get your mouse .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2312.62	But they do want some gadgets .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2423.73	Let's go .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2427.24	Finish the meeting now .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	Finish	[]	[]	[]
2438.78	No , get away .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2448.32	Well you'll have to work on this one .	TS3009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
43.49	Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
52.36	Okay um the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um , then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
67.52	We'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
108.59	Let's do the look and feel design presentation first .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
570.19	It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing , you know , kinda push it .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
596.03	There it could have a stem like that , 'cause I do l kind of like the stem .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
757.47	I will give it a one .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
837.38	But they'll notice it after like a year , they'll be like hey , I have never changed the battery .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	notice	[]	[]	[]
877.71	Think I'm gonna go with the four as well .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
913.54	Give it a one .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	Give	[]	[]	[]
1149.56	Mm I'd give it a four .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1194.98	I'd give it a one .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1247.09	So I'll give it a a two .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1267.1	All of them should have R.R. , yeah .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[R.R.]
1300.26	Let me one more space .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1429.59	Okay , so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1435.08	could have up to thr I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1481.42	Let's see what that would do .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1544.78	Um save .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1563.21	Let's move on to the project evaluation .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1575.36	So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information , um how how well I guess I led it , um the how well we worked together as a team , um the digital pens , the whiteboard .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1780.65	Um so , this is the great product kids , I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it , um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope um 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	produce	[]	[]	[]
1794.4	Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1807.38	If we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1880.65	Yeah , but check it out .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
1889.12	Um just wanna make sure you do .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2020.23	And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint as that's not as necessary to have .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[PowerPoint, PowerPoint]
2380.74	We should make one that walks by itself .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2429.01	Just gonna make I'm making full minutes , so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
2473.9	I know personally when I do PowerPoint , that's what I do and so I had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and I would do your three .	ES2008d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
310.91	Agree .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	Agree	[]	[]	[]
378.41	But twenty six percent , do you know 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
764.28	We should only make a remote control , nothing more .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
778.45	So , make a click , please .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
797.78	But you know , we can use it for a T.V. easily .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[T.V.]
803.32	Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
832.68	Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[]
850.93	Our question of the style , we should remember that our company 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
916.01	W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours , 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
921.73	and we can put all the options into this screen .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
924.96	We'll need only few buttons .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
933.44	And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
956.63	I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	propose	[]	[]	[]
986.58	When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T.V. , 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1016.87	Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
1104.79	you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1109.45	Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1124.08	All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1146.98	We can just extend it to any device .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	extend	[]	[]	[]
1165.09	In fact I would propose another solution .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	propose	[]	[]	[]
1172.29	So uh set up your T.V. set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1806.41	roll 'em up or roll 'em down .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	roll	[]	[]	[]
1879.82	Let's send more , let's sell more .	IS1006b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
391.76	by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
443.2	And then evaluation itself .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	evaluation	[]	[]	[]
496.43	Think .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
630.53	Let's give it a two .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
696.32	to handle .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	handle	[]	[]	[]
701.36	I would rate it a 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	rate	[]	[]	[]
714.06	But that's that's vantage of L.C.D. screen , you can have text .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
743.99	You can touch it .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	touch	[]	[]	[]
1125.39	I think once you've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L.C.D. screen extra , scroll 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	microphone	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1146.77	Make it make it a two .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1149.13	Or make it uh a fucking two .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1159.95	Has oh yeah , do did have nah y you have the black one .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1163.66	And we'll probably make also a yellow one .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1215.25	Let's go th for 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1368.86	Li like write it be 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[Li]
1407.86	But b al but we also have sample speaker , do 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[al]
1448.8	Push button .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	Push	[]	[]	[]
1482.27	We could use 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1531.41	Yeah , but tha that that only is one .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	tha	[]	[]	[]
1624.5	Point twelve .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	Point	[]	[]	[]
1679.58	Then we can make add two colours on it .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1692.87	They can add two colours .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1930.61	just tap somewhere .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	tap	[]	[]	[]
1974.33	And erase the mic .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	erase	[]	[]	[]
2088.81	Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
2108.02	Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something , but now we're completely separated from each other .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
2124.11	Yeah okay , but I don I do I think becau that's because 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[becau]
2626.2	Celebration time , come on .	TS3005d.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
188.09	So , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole .	ES2008c.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
212.76	The case , uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case .	ES2008c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
247.97	Um buttons , for buttons we have um pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L. L.C.D. screen .	ES2008c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Reaction, L., L.C.D.]
263.77	Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are .	ES2008c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
276.59	Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A. batteries , but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up .	ES2008c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
290.17	Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery .	ES2008c.B.words.xml	recharge	[]	[]	[]
409.55	Um I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing .	ES2008c.B.words.xml	appreciate	[]	[]	[]
497.81	I have save this in the uh shared projects , if anyone wants to look and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information .	ES2008c.B.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1287.4	Um , mean 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1342.33	We could colour-co-ordinate them , li 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	colour	[]	[]	[li]
1417.71	I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four .	ES2008c.B.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[iPod]
1441.89	It wel well yeah , it would I mean each version of it has been a little bit different , but 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1561.04	And you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever .	ES2008c.B.words.xml	co	[]	[]	[]
1679.44	I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works .	ES2008c.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1749.35	Yeah , th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll .	ES2008c.B.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
1807.55	So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later .	ES2008c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
262.96	Smile fish .	IS1006a.C.words.xml	Smile	[]	[]	[]
487.11	Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like .	IS1006a.C.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
504.15	Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame .	IS1006a.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
513.48	Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame .	IS1006a.C.words.xml	remove	[]	[]	[]
604.09	We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations .	IS1006a.C.words.xml	adapt	[]	[]	[]
690.1	But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah , you can only have one bit .	IS1006a.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
185.91	Can try to plug that in there but 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
272.15	uh add some more underneath here .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
274.81	Maybe give it , give it a form .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
277.63	I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , so yeah , you have some rub yeah .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
285.81	Exactly , use both .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
288.53	Might as well think about 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
560.57	S give it a one .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
676.74	Y you could add an extra feature actually .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
683.62	raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	raise	[]	[]	[]
689.87	We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
730.41	Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	alarm	[]	[]	[]
735.42	Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	Ran	[]	[]	[]
745.13	Let's add one of those features and say yes .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
816.65	to fold and stuff .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	fold	[]	[]	[]
1055.92	People can change it every month .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	change	[every month]	[]	[]
1111.49	It's just one mo single mould , we can do that .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1158.45	We could of course make the buttons wood .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1162.25	Say mahogany or so 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
1238.09	You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1292.11	take away a heck of a lot of the there you go .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1455.47	Heads are gonna roll , believe me .	ES2016d.B.words.xml	believe	[]	[]	[]
650.17	Yes you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work .	TS3009b.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
903.57	Yeah , go ahead .	TS3009b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1123.7	Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this .	TS3009b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1149.29	Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it , I think .	TS3009b.B.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
1358.12	So we can can uh yeah customise the 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	customise	[]	[]	[]
1385.24	Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote .	TS3009b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1446.46	We should go with that concept I think .	TS3009b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1600.08	Yeah , we should keep that simple too .	TS3009b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1654.92	Or maybe you will get that information uh Yeah .	TS3009b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1744.2	Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody .	TS3009b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1932.94	Yes , as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons .	TS3009b.B.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
2100.84	Well consensus , um We we can put it in the middle , so 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2244.71	We we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here .	TS3009b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2305.31	Yeah , but you can can zap down 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	zap	[]	[]	[]
2350.05	Yeah well y you must have .	TS3009b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2354.22	Yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something , and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	adjust	[]	[]	[]
156.39	make a yellow well to make a banana 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
227.11	But normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
253.27	So once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
259.08	To navigate yeah .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	navigate	[]	[]	[]
287.65	Well you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can f 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
373.43	You know , to give you the correct look and feel .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
390.04	consider that .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
415.67	If I was gonna place them I'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit but yeah I don't I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
554.88	Or can move between positions in the in the number .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
769.72	I'd give it a six like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
838.44	Remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on T.V.s .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[T.V.s]
1013.92	Yeah but it says I , I would buy this , so .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1026.99	I would buy 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1090.49	if that was like my limit , maybe I would buy it .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1117.83	I'd give it I'd give it a 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1237.6	Well just leave it at that then .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
1430.78	Well , wait a second , no , it's it's double curved , it's got a c , it's uh 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1481.11	Well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1543.94	think about it myself but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button but you know the turbo button does add that extra class .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1558.22	So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	rethink	[]	[]	[]
1592.51	Make it plastic instead of rubber .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1815.69	Might have to draw a face on it .	IS1004d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1861.01	I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers , do we really need an integrated circuit to 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
183.8	And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh , well , what what d do we want , and how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	watch	[]	[]	[]
225.99	Think of the Teletubbies , for instance .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[Teletubbies]
249.95	No , I'll I'll get to that .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
280.85	Well , we could also use a battery , that's a bit 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
292.9	Well , y you could just go for a battery .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
308.51	Uh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
315.8	Uh for uh ultimate b uh n uh use of uh solar panels , you could actually use uh you could use uh solar panels , but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control , leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
346.18	So it would actually power itself uh from a T.V. .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	power	[]	[]	[T.V.]
348.38	But , well you just take up all the space , and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
382.44	But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[Jarek]
387.46	And for rest , you'd just add juice on the battery .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
408.0	You ha I you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh it was kind of square and uh I figured that's a bit boring .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
416.46	So you you we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
425.87	Or but but you could go in a in an double curves .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
437.61	But , that uh we'll discuss later .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
450.65	Uh , yeah , I ca I ca I could I could show you .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
453.36	I could show you .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
460.47	Let's say that's your standard uh 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
471.74	But you could actually go like uh something like this .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
478.14	And then uh in three-D. effect you could go 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[D.]
493.14	So But but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth , you could you could uh just play around a bit with .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
514.52	You We could choose uh what uh what's better , plastic um or rubber .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
541.5	uh , oh , talk about it later .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
554.4	And uh chip set , well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go uh with a simple chip set .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
561.71	But uh if we decide to go on a n uh um L.C.D. screen , we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
569.84	And that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
609.74	I'll I'll I'll just add , uh uh I put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
648.22	Uh , well that would bring the m m some more costs , but I mean the 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
672.15	No , we'll we'll just wait and uh Uh , plastic versus rubber .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
696.7	So um , you could go for plastic , but I figured 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
701.29	I I I would choose rubber .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
733.13	Yeah , that would cover it .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	cover	[]	[]	[]
734.35	That that would solve the problem .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	solve	[]	[]	[]
779.95	Well I figure if we go for L. L.C.D. , we we should have the advanced .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L., L.C.D.]
1548.5	Because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1762.52	So there's n that's there's uh besides uh the remote control , you'll have a separate uh 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1920.75	I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1929.48	So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
1940.88	Could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model , uh for instance .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[ma]
2012.54	Yeah , you could you could you could go like uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2017.02	You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	blame	[]	[]	[]
2124.46	Well yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
2131.69	Yeah , which buttons do you want to in it .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2133.49	Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
2142.87	Yeah , you could you could m have people want uh want that .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2287.93	Well , if you if you have the l L.C.D. screen , you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
2293.47	And it could just stay there .	TS3007c.C.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
308.15	Take my contraptions with me .	ES2008a.D.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
343.94	Sort of give an idea .	ES2008a.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
356.66	You can imagine it in the water .	ES2008a.D.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
535.45	I just wanna watch the T.V. um .	ES2008a.D.words.xml	watch	[]	[]	[wanna, T.V.]
272.92	Maybe maybe I should uh start .	IS1004b.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
315.8	Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting .	IS1004b.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
505.98	Also the z the design should fit the hand shape .	IS1004b.D.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
2058.92	But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars , it's 	IS1004b.D.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
10.85	And again I'll take minutes .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
14.62	The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
58.75	Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
97.36	Go for it .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
97.81	Do you want 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
305.79	Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
360.14	Test it out .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	Test	[]	[]	[]
402.85	We'll just send all of our manufacturing to 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
526.32	Yeah , just prepare one now .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	prepare	[]	[]	[]
657.75	Yeah , I think I think for um I mean most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to um 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
931.51	But do yeah , yeah .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
959.5	Put fashion in electronics .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
1012.7	Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1035.09	unscrew this first .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	unscrew	[]	[]	[]
1153.73	Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	fold	[]	[]	[]
1239.11	Push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we I don't think that makes sense .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	Push	[]	[]	[pushbutton]
1346.36	Take it down to just a scroll wheel .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
1350.27	We could do 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1369.6	You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1439.86	Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1456.0	We we'll leave it at that and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , yeah .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
1656.76	Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1737.29	I'll leave the room and you can have another go .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
1746.02	Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
1805.87	Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control .	ES2006d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Google]
261.21	How do I get it 	ES2016b.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
348.23	have something yeah .	ES2016b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
381.13	And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful .	ES2016b.D.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
538.08	The groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it's worth investing in this .	ES2016b.D.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
2127.39	Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote .	ES2016b.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
49.02	So um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy .	IS1006c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[Rama]	[Mark, Sammy]
104.11	And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing .	IS1006c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[Sammy]
955.06	Want to change my neighbour .	IS1006c.A.words.xml	Want	[]	[]	[]
1590.92	Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again .	IS1006c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1614.46	Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay .	IS1006c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1627.73	and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .	IS1006c.A.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1739.59	Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy 	IS1006c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1792.2	Or or spongy an yeah .	IS1006c.A.words.xml	spongy	[]	[]	[]
1826.84	Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium .	IS1006c.A.words.xml	pretend	[]	[]	[]
1844.99	So explore a shape .	IS1006c.A.words.xml	explore	[]	[]	[]
231.44	Imagine you're doing it with your left hand , I don't think it's too 	ES2007d.B.words.xml	Imagine	[]	[]	[]
238.16	But we can have both uh 	ES2007d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1098.03	Glad to hear that .	ES2007d.B.words.xml	hear	[]	[]	[Glad]
473.51	If I could go there with this cable .	IS1005b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
566.99	I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together .	IS1005b.C.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
600.95	Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands .	IS1005b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
621.65	And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to uh r to realise the command .	IS1005b.C.words.xml	r	[]	[]	[]
698.96	So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T.V. and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control .	IS1005b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[T.V.]
726.11	And uh personal preferences , uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way .	IS1005b.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
804.18	We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission .	IS1005b.C.words.xml	tune	[]	[]	[]
874.83	The password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem .	IS1005b.C.words.xml	solve	[]	[]	[]
560.87	Well , I shall go to the next slide .	TS3008c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
609.34	Yeah , I I uh well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier .	TS3008c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
848.54	Yeah , click on it .	TS3008c.B.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1469.89	Because our our motto is we put fashion 	TS3008c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1682.81	Yeah , you just can drop it .	TS3008c.B.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
1718.27	But can we ge uh uh 	TS3008c.B.words.xml	ge	[]	[]	[]
2124.1	The funct yeah , I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea .	TS3008c.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[st, joystick]
490.49	Go for it .	ES2009a.C.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
543.83	Think I'm just gonna put down one uh one C.D. .	ES2009a.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[C.D.]
601.47	Love um 	ES2009a.C.words.xml	Love	[]	[]	[]
1180.71	We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well .	ES2009a.C.words.xml	c	[]	[]	[]
1217.03	Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it .	ES2009a.C.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
182.09	Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one I mean we're gonna use the L.C.D. screen anyway .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
188.38	So we'll just have to use it for everything .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
190.87	And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
243.17	So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
251.26	So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
327.91	'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
651.35	So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[Euros]
680.63	'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[Euro]
721.99	You can go into you in you main menu , you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
998.29	Drop everything .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	Drop	[]	[]	[]
1282.42	Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if When it's on , yeah , it's turned on , 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
1318.56	Say .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
1335.69	We'll make it a Morse code .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Morse]
1357.71	Yeah I would go for five or six , yeah .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	go	[five or]	[]	[]
1365.06	Let's not diss our remote .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1482.71	I mean the sponge-like and the three D. shape , that would give it something young and fresh .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[D.]
1615.66	So I would go for one .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1710.82	Ah we can do the math .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1761.52	Just type in the digits .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	type	[]	[]	[]
1764.63	And then you can count them together .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	count	[]	[]	[]
1998.91	Have to take this away also .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
2104.08	We do have special colour .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2106.68	Does it mean uh that 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
2180.26	We can try .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2246.2	We can make a l a logo .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2250.16	Like uh put it like the shape .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2462.94	But sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
2570.66	So i if I change this , it will go there , if I change that , will go there .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2578.5	I will take this away 'cause it looks messy .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2725.39	Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that Yeah .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
2805.86	And uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	take	[half a day]	[]	[PowerPoint, PowerPoint]
2822.5	give it a kind of a home style , like we have i 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2876.0	You know , you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2949.26	Wait .	TS3006d.C.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
564.98	use Bluetooth .	ES2007b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[Bluetooth]
1047.17	Come on .	ES2007b.D.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
1089.19	Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy .	ES2007b.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
1109.0	like match how people behave .	ES2007b.D.words.xml	match	[]	[]	[]
1155.5	Anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .	ES2007b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1224.36	And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .	ES2007b.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
601.24	But you would still have the buttons .	IS1003c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
760.1	Cause for example yeah .	IS1003c.D.words.xml	Cause	[]	[]	[]
840.19	Uh thi this 	IS1003c.D.words.xml	thi	[]	[]	[]
860.98	See 	IS1003c.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1304.29	Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um 	IS1003c.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1318.95	have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .	IS1003c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1402.68	And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance .	IS1003c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1557.9	But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or I dunno .	IS1003c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
196.23	And , yeah , it's true that she's an assistant professor , but uh well , we see , maybe we can move a little bit around just to give her uh , well , also at least , maybe not a uh an office alone , but at least with just one person , not two .	IB4005.C.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
445.38	Um well , uh I can think of some reactions from the people wi so maybe I can Well , r 	IB4005.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
452.5	Yeah , well , tell me about some of the constraints and Well , first of all I must say that there are also quite a lot of common points , so um it's probably not going to be very difficult to Yeah , please .	IB4005.C.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
500.8	But the most obvious constraints that uh we we found here was that it was probably very difficult to have a lounge uh just a lounge in one room , because it would block us two full working places .	IB4005.C.words.xml	block	[]	[]	[]
565.91	Um , it's also true that she has quite a lot of files for most of the the projects actually that we manage , so it appeared , at least to well to our group , that even if she's here only half time , she should have an office by her own because it would be quite disturbing for other people to to work in the the same office .	IB4005.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
645.6	Uh , so um that she's an Italic , she will arrive in about two month .	IB4005.C.words.xml	arrive	[about two month]	[]	[Italic]
670.98	So I think there is quite a lot of space here to uh switch a little bit among the people , just to make some kind of smooth occupancy rate , so not to have one empty room when we have no visitors , um and uh then a very full room when everybody is is here .	IB4005.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
727.12	So we should manage some kind of decent space .	IB4005.C.words.xml	manage	[]	[]	[]
815.5	It was the fact that sometimes professor have to professors have to discuss sensitive matters about projects and financing , and they sometimes might feel uncomfortable discussing this with their well , in the presence of their P.H.D. students .	IB4005.C.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[P.H.D.]
990.63	Yeah , well , it was actually this pressure from from my group that led to this , to squeeze a little bit uh the place of the lounge .	IB4005.C.words.xml	squeeze	[]	[]	[]
1025.7	So we could have a separate room as a lounge as long as uh we pack the other offices .	IB4005.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1416.83	Whe I I think I would prefer , and probably my group would prefer , to see them with the respective assistants , and I think Pierrette plus Marianne is a very good combination .	IB4005.C.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[Whe, Pierrette, Marianne]
1432.76	Yeah , switch the whole group .	IB4005.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
1479.32	Yeah , maybe we can write it down , say vis vis one .	IB4005.C.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1504.82	You know , call I.M. two .	IB4005.C.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[I.M.]
1628.93	So we could at least think it's sort of an open place .	IB4005.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1699.53	Because remember there is also this Paola arriving um on the new project .	IB4005.C.words.xml	remember	[]	[Paola]	[]
1879.81	So we can already argue that uh we're squeezing in even the the professors .	IB4005.C.words.xml	argue	[]	[]	[]
1979.83	Perfect , just save it please .	IB4005.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1070.55	I think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to .	ES2015c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1074.79	Just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , so and , and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons .	ES2015c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1290.61	Um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control .	ES2015c.D.words.xml	live	[]	[]	[]
1311.41	Um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed .	ES2015c.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1315.2	Um , so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across .	ES2015c.D.words.xml	list	[]	[]	[]
1778.72	Think it was called command interface .	ES2015c.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1939.54	Some T.V.s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high .	ES2015c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.s]
2092.39	Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true .	ES2015c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2101.76	So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds .	ES2015c.D.words.xml	appeal	[fifteen to twenty five year olds]	[]	[]
138.53	Come on , move it .	TS3008a.D.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
151.1	Now , wake up , bitch .	TS3008a.D.words.xml	wake	[]	[]	[]
171.87	Come on .	TS3008a.D.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
174.73	Get back to me .	TS3008a.D.words.xml	Get	[]	[]	[]
735.17	I'll go next .	TS3008a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
750.18	Thank you , I'll draw a penguin .	TS3008a.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
760.88	I'll draw a penguin .	TS3008a.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
766.56	you can start to laugh already .	TS3008a.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
782.39	Come on .	TS3008a.D.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
1321.08	I will need it .	TS3008a.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
40.14	Um , think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
44.82	In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
82.61	And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
99.4	Alright Nathan , take it away .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[Nathan]
939.61	To produce each one .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	produce	[]	[]	[]
965.0	Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[wanna]
1023.45	we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	shrink	[]	[]	[]
1063.07	No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[iPod]
1296.99	We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	omit	[]	[]	[]
1308.6	Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	sic	[]	[]	[]
1320.26	We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[]
1465.19	And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1493.83	Yeah , I mean a nice although we do um wh uh is I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1584.38	We'll have more of an idea when the prototype 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1587.57	have more of a we'll have more of an idea later on .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1591.79	And we just yeah go from there .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1661.43	B But no I mean we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1867.12	But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
1878.02	Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1882.43	I want the uh I'd like Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	accomplish	[]	[]	[Nathan]
1905.8	figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
1920.16	Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place .	ES2009c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
323.44	Go down .	IS1007a.B.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
328.67	See there's a role for everybody .	IS1007a.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
335.58	But look at your role , your marketing role .	IS1007a.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
465.44	We maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface .	IS1007a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
501.86	And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list .	IS1007a.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
521.53	For example you can get um 	IS1007a.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
527.54	You can use uh well for example anything .	IS1007a.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
620.13	Some of the websites they already provide this service , so we can just use the service available .	IS1007a.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
625.18	Download it uh to the to this remote control .	IS1007a.B.words.xml	Download	[]	[]	[]
636.05	So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons .	IS1007a.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
754.41	Go on , draw something .	IS1007a.B.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
808.68	Uh to choose 	IS1007a.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
829.31	Choose by contents or by channels .	IS1007a.B.words.xml	Choose	[]	[]	[]
895.88	We will get information and then we'll come back in .	IS1007a.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
904.15	Yeah , we'll come .	IS1007a.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
149.88	Look .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
154.07	Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
170.4	If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , um but mainly it's speech recognition .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
182.21	Yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	project	[]	[]	[]
195.68	Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
212.6	It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	lie	[]	[]	[]
225.01	Uh yeah , that Well , we did think of that .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
257.97	Well , if you hold it , you can you all can hold it , is it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you've got small hands .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
269.08	It would have to be a bit bigger .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
272.35	Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
525.88	So we could even add something .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
606.84	Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if What do you th We're trying to save money , so .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
618.09	But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
873.25	Oh could you pass the tomato please .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	pass	[]	[]	[]
950.38	Sorry , carry on .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	carry	[]	[]	[]
1402.47	Go for three .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1537.53	Um so I'd give the company strategy 	ES2005d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1561.83	Okay , just leave it , it's fine .	ES2005d.D.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
265.78	Let me check that I I di I didn't .	IB4004.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
467.3	uh I would have I would have a provocative suggestion to put Gisella to switch Nancy and Gisella .	IB4004.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Gisella, Nancy, Gisella]
494.69	'Cause I really do think it's important to have 	IB4004.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
497.46	an admin room clearly identified as an admin room and only an admin room , where you have files , where yeah , you can close it , you have the personal files of the of the people of the of the of the unit etcetera , etcetera .	IB4004.D.words.xml	close	[]	[etcetera]	[]
920.77	So I would switch David and Nancy typically .	IB4004.D.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[David, Nancy]
935.79	But I definitely would put uh Nancy with Agnes in the two person room .	IB4004.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[Nancy, Agnes]
1063.99	We can read newspapers elsewhere .	IB4004.D.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
1066.66	And I really do think it's more important for lab to be able to decently uh welcome visitors that come to the lab than to have a place for reading newspapers .	IB4004.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1075.72	Newspapers you can read them home .	IB4004.D.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
1080.43	You can go on the balcony if it's if it's in the summer .	IB4004.D.words.xml	go	[the summer]	[]	[]
1123.17	I would advocate to just remove the lounge .	IB4004.D.words.xml	advocate	[]	[]	[]
1206.66	And to drink their coffee .	IB4004.D.words.xml	drink	[]	[]	[]
1220.63	you can do it in your office .	IB4004.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1262.82	That could take one one positions in the in the lo in the 	IB4004.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1331.87	you you will explain to your visitors that unfortunately they have a position in the toilet , because there is a reading room where people have to relax .	IB4004.D.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
1364.56	Could put you can switch .	IB4004.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1382.39	Yeah you could you could put me there .	IB4004.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1527.77	To keep Paola with Maria in the two people room and to have this one with two , Yalina and David in the three people room .	IB4004.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[Paola, Yalina]	[Maria, David]
1654.85	So the lounge will just die after some point and it uh it 	IB4004.D.words.xml	die	[]	[]	[]
1702.61	Yeah , but then then you can you can move for instance if you move David to uh with Maria .	IB4004.D.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[David, Maria]
1741.06	If you if we realistically can plan to have a lounge .	IB4004.D.words.xml	plan	[]	[]	[]
1785.2	But do you have any no .	IB4004.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1873.07	David will go to the to the two people room .	IB4004.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[David]
1905.29	And we will have visitors , for sure .	IB4004.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2025.8	So then we would have two people there .	IB4004.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2060.69	Uh the second point I would suggest is that before you go to defend it , you should uh mm circulate it uh over mail to all the all the con involved people .	IB4004.D.words.xml	circulate	[]	[]	[]
2077.59	I would do it before .	IB4004.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2147.03	I'm reachable when I'm at uh well , they can phone me on the mobile , but uh I would definitely prefer to have a clean filled administrative form that I can give back .	IB4004.D.words.xml	phone	[]	[]	[]
2217.32	And if you go back to the uh to the uh other sli slide where you have the furniture so with this uh we do we have any m any any word to say and uh so that I would like to have a red chair or a blue desk uh or a 	IB4004.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
136.13	I'll just put it in there .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
159.21	Move to meeting room .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	Move	[]	[]	[]
202.99	Did you open it already or no .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
238.36	Uh I will address them uh in a moment .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	address	[]	[]	[]
265.93	So to give you an idea .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1000.81	get your own information .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1264.13	But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1269.58	Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1276.88	Maybe you can c have this kind of shape .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1420.93	It uh c it can go open .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1518.88	Yeah we we better so choose one 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1522.56	Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1526.41	But that's the kind of the idea , so it lays good in the hand , and then on on the side with with your thumb , you you can you can use , yeah , you can use the button option 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1628.3	To draw , I guess .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2036.93	I I probably get instruction on that , how to do that , so I make another presentation I guess .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2142.08	Sound button press .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	Sound	[]	[]	[]
2179.59	Maybe you should draw it very large like this .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2374.92	It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	flip	[]	[]	[]
2438.53	Come on .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
2481.35	Uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control .	TS3006c.D.words.xml	deal	[]	[]	[]
173.35	And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals .	ES2009b.B.words.xml	cause	[]	[]	[]
178.76	Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .	ES2009b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
756.88	And then it could start to beep and 	ES2009b.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
833.81	Oh go ahead .	ES2009b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1013.73	See if there if there's even interest out there .	ES2009b.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1323.05	Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .	ES2009b.B.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
95.96	Go ahead .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
238.87	Wait , there's was one thing I wanted to ask .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
258.27	Yeah , but do we have do we need extra buttons , for example some uh some have to 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
329.76	No , listen listen .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	listen	[]	[]	[]
379.96	No , but then they would a would also support that button , because it's the same thing .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	support	[]	[]	[]
417.39	Think about it .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
454.99	No , we'll apply them then for now .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	apply	[]	[]	[]
498.16	I do think that uh m T.V.s support mur multiple kind of remote controls .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[T.V.s]
689.02	Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues still to come .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
806.09	Yeah , we'll talk about the lights later .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
811.78	But uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , but may I dunno if that's important , but we'll talk about that later .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	dunno	[]	[]	[]
949.79	Oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1078.01	But I do think it's more 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1081.25	But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1274.12	Ah yeah , just make it we'll make it a two .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1288.02	Yeah , you have make an slogan is quite obvious .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1295.05	Yeah , you can put that on the side if if we would like to .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1318.65	Yeah , make it a two .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1347.14	Yeah , and that's mostly the inno when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	score	[]	[]	[]
1418.84	We'll stumble upon some problems .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	stumble	[]	[]	[]
1432.06	try it again .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1447.99	I i uh I'll explain its Uh , the the components are listed over here .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
1461.31	And then uh , we'll uh calcula Don't watch the number yet .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	calcula	[]	[]	[]
1479.07	we should know how many 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1534.39	Maybe you can uh look it up right now .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1626.62	Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost I don't know .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	Fill	[]	[]	[]
1697.18	give our own interpretation to , because else we would really have a problem .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1725.17	Yeah , we could skip the numbers .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
1748.27	We'll give the buttons special colour .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1750.22	We'll give them a special form .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1796.38	There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1866.75	And maybe then we can do something extra .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1875.13	We can put then 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1877.4	We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1891.7	Yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[ki]
1899.75	Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1934.71	Yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1999.83	You can look at it for s presentation .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2378.26	Yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one we can still make 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2513.87	It We can make it yeah no .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2529.99	Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[qui]
2555.84	Trust me .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	Trust	[]	[]	[]
2574.49	We can really can do the docking thing , uh it's not yeah , uh we can do it , but it's would be a easy way out .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2652.68	Yeah , and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2657.88	just to give it some extra special feature , and uh I know it will work , but uh it's it's an They're they're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2668.66	to make it happen .	TS3008d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
718.0	Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything .	IS1005c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
749.78	Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design .	IS1005c.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
980.94	Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know .	IS1005c.B.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
1270.22	We could put the board next to , well , under the L.C.D. and for example make the L.C.D. be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand .	IS1005c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
1304.52	I'll make it .	IS1005c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1348.69	Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and I will work it out .	IS1005c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1467.24	But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so .	IS1005c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1560.93	Peeling of the banana , you know , should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden .	IS1005c.B.words.xml	discover	[]	[]	[]
1572.62	First layer obviously spo Yeah , w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think .	IS1005c.B.words.xml	appreciate	[]	[]	[]
1849.98	So that we can reach the energy out of it out of that .	IS1005c.B.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
182.89	Take that one off .	ES2015d.C.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
198.02	You can go one , three or something .	ES2015d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
318.53	Just so we can flick 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	flick	[]	[]	[]
348.14	And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well .	ES2015d.C.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
791.43	I'll go for three as well .	ES2015d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
844.5	Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent .	ES2015d.C.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
969.91	You're use the zero .	ES2015d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
972.26	Make a new one .	ES2015d.C.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1045.45	Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it'll vibra 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	vibra	[]	[]	[]
1088.86	It would have to be in the market 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1869.39	to fit in with our areas of expertise .	ES2015d.C.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
145.36	uh talk about working design .	TS3008b.C.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
178.64	Um , the known technology can make a cost very low .	TS3008b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
220.22	Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it's it is uh 	TS3008b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1123.72	But you can put them under the same button .	TS3008b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1144.42	But you can put a play and stop and and rewind .	TS3008b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1339.89	Yes , but you could put 	TS3008b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1347.47	If you have seven pages , you can go up and down .	TS3008b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1398.03	Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick .	TS3008b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
217.18	In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
250.92	So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
279.72	Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	eat	[]	[]	[]
517.8	Uh , for turn turn the ball .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
612.59	So you can capture voice yeah , you c 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	capture	[]	[]	[]
615.51	Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	capture	[]	[]	[]
666.97	You can use this in this way .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
674.79	So you can turn to change the channel .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
723.8	So change .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
765.85	You can do it .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
772.71	I think so , you can just change .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
818.95	You ca you can turn this .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
820.45	Or you ca you can you can also turn this .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
823.01	For this you can tune it's for tune .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	tune	[]	[]	[]
879.38	Yeah , agree , agree .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
923.53	There's two kind of balls , the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[]
935.61	Yeah , yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
972.95	Uh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1315.91	We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1361.17	Wait .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
1466.38	Agree .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	Agree	[]	[]	[]
1490.44	Cou could we have look 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[Cou]
1609.71	to create a control instead of a computer .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
1687.85	So you can you have base , triangle base so you the T.V. you can 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1794.87	And you can celebrate your leadership .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	celebrate	[]	[]	[]
1817.33	Sell it .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	Sell	[]	[]	[]
1909.62	So we have give him give it a cute name .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2023.2	So buy one .	IS1003d.C.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
325.17	Yeah go ahead .	IS1005a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
434.0	Maybe put it up Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something .	IS1005a.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
501.47	Maybe we should just continue .	IS1005a.D.words.xml	continue	[]	[]	[]
448.32	Let's have a squeezable remote .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
602.5	Go rubber .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
603.69	Go rubber the whole way .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
775.63	The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	program	[]	[]	[]
790.59	So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	program	[]	[]	[Rick]
1078.74	we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or , or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1101.7	But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1217.15	I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	channel	[]	[]	[]
1228.55	And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1300.22	But I think that should be I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[]
1399.14	Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1603.8	Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1640.04	Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1743.4	Okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2212.26	Okay , I'll stay in here .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
2223.75	Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
2285.45	Well I I did notice looking at I mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R.R. brand and and to be immediately noticeable .	ES2007c.C.words.xml	notice	[]	[R.R.]	[]
51.25	to make presentation about 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
58.72	And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
69.79	And we have think I got a new project requirement .	IS1007b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
98.31	And of course we should have our image 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
117.01	Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want .	IS1007b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
151.3	Do you want to open 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
437.04	Yeah we can change the b .	IS1007b.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
655.36	We can use this .	IS1007b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
703.9	Keep the navigation but 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	Keep	[]	[]	[]
945.86	But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility .	IS1007b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1020.69	If it's necessary can you can do that .	IS1007b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1023.95	We can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really a problem .	IS1007b.A.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[]
1260.41	we will meet after .	IS1007b.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
593.28	Uh I will start .	TS3010a.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
694.61	Help also .	TS3010a.C.words.xml	Help	[]	[]	[]
253.3	Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
633.1	Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
673.93	The television must do that .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
775.38	Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L.C.D. .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1018.8	Maybe one of you can paint it on the board .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	paint	[]	[]	[]
1040.63	Yeah , but maybe we can paint it .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	paint	[]	[]	[]
1046.94	I'll paint .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	paint	[]	[]	[]
1267.99	Yeah , but I'll zap .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	zap	[]	[]	[]
1286.4	Paint it .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	Paint	[]	[]	[]
1306.02	Do I have to do everything .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1592.58	Mean , it's better .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	Mean	[]	[]	[]
1636.44	Think we have to keep them .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1668.53	Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can You have to use t with one hand .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1688.72	So , please look at it .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1993.84	So hurry up .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	hurry	[]	[]	[]
1998.88	You two stay here .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
2001.92	Paint it .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	Paint	[]	[]	[]
2010.63	Check your mail .	TS3010c.A.words.xml	Check	[]	[]	[]
346.66	Suppose I can draw an animal , yeah .	ES2011a.B.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
118.32	Sign off .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	Sign	[]	[]	[]
122.61	We did send it to him , yeah .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
309.73	I think I'm do I think I'm working out who's top and bottom .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
395.88	You can point to a soft component .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
443.15	Two hundred and fifteen to go .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
692.84	You could point to it if it were there .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
900.28	Yeah , you could do .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
990.64	I would mark that .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[]
1147.27	Wait , where 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
1394.78	Let's keep them .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1430.43	Oh , rubbish .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	rubbish	[]	[]	[]
1614.98	Oh feature , absolutely .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	feature	[]	[]	[]
1677.89	Take it again , but systems should be out .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
1750.01	See that i that's talking about the the flux of kin of ionising photons rather then the continuum of that spectrum .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1789.44	Yeah , you can have that as well .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1827.48	Well , you'd know where they are in the 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1857.11	Yeah , but the feature itself is blue wing flux or if it was said blue wing feature , we'd mark feature .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[]
1913.31	Well you can point to blue wing flux , 'cause you have your line and there's the blue wing flux .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
2381.31	I'm right , look .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2390.96	G ah , look at that .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2415.47	Yeah , we could always change this if we think we're right , rather than going back through and 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
2423.75	Based on this , but we could change this rule rather than changing all those things .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
2530.96	Yeah , just cross those out .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	cross	[]	[]	[]
2668.47	Yeah , absorption profiles I'll go for .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2688.05	Yeah , take out the blanketing .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2735.01	So do they mean the V.L.B.A. .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	mean	[]	[V.L.B.A.]	[]
3005.82	We did just have it , don't know .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3071.03	Mm the soft excess you can definitely point to on an X. ray thing .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[X.]
3109.43	Give that for red and blue components , but I wouldn't probably give that for soft component .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	Give	[]	[]	[]
3127.8	Yeah , I'd take out red and blue .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
3169.1	So we sh should kill it .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	kill	[]	[]	[]
3296.46	would make a s study Seyfert one point eights .	EN2006a.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Seyfert]
828.55	Come on .	TS3010b.B.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
837.59	Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design .	TS3010b.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
907.46	But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more .	TS3010b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
921.57	Uh maybe more devices you can influence .	TS3010b.B.words.xml	influence	[]	[]	[]
947.82	what way we would go .	TS3010b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1392.07	get the younger 	TS3010b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
42.57	wanna go today .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	go	[today]	[]	[wanna]
123.09	Oh , write the sum okay , right .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
244.03	Give you false impressions of what's hap s something's going on .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	Give	[]	[]	[]
353.94	But uh I can do that .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
381.83	If you if you ch if you change your window manager , it might look a little bit nicer .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
393.72	Actually can we run it on Windows .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[Windows]
694.93	Let's take 'em to the next joke .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
786.49	And when I update my N.L. , just uh recompile the M. browsers and then just uh get that .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	recompile	[]	[N.L.]	[M.]
792.8	Well , so it'll use as my part as well , my um the M. search .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[M.]
801.03	Just prefix 'em with an M. and Or 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	prefix	[]	[]	[M.]
919.17	Maybe I'll check see if I can find anyone .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
1006.12	Get a lot of audio .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	Get	[]	[]	[]
1051.04	So if we are gonna look through only five of them , just pick the top five to to do the the search and Since that's probably what we're looking for anyways .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
1069.75	Maybe I'll try .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1098.08	How do you guys find the documentation for N.X.T. and 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[N.X.T.]
1151.63	Um 'cause the thing is I mean we can keep working on little things f you know and sh Oh , well we should do this or do this .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1174.27	Well we yeah , I guess well we can still come up with like test cases or whatever for for the people and just yeah , come up with scenarios , that sort of thing .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1207.73	To work on it as well .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1231.33	We'll probably have to talk to Steve at some point as well I guess .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Steve]
1236.76	I'll probably just have a regular Tuesday meeting with him .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	have	[Tuesday]	[]	[]
1239.49	Like we can send him an email , but I don't know if he's around even .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1252.62	Although do we really want the answer .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1314.82	So that might be an idea , get a range of types of people as well .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1325.65	Set a wider range of people .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	Set	[]	[]	[]
1347.9	Then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1437.66	And report .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	report	[]	[]	[]
1445.37	But we should ask him .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1480.58	No , it's it just funny that , you know , have it finish by Monday .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	finish	[Monday]	[]	[]
1531.43	No actually I might have this stuff here .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1566.49	We should have it done anyways .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1572.74	Is is that is that a part of the demonstration , did they want that information , the evaluation as part of yep .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1619.97	I'd expect somewhere ten to fifteen pages .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	expect	[]	[]	[]
1695.01	Although just to get it out of the way .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1696.04	So I'll try and remember to do that to my own s 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1735.17	Then as these come up it'll just pop 'em in there .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	pop	[]	[]	[]
1747.44	I mean how to get that that communication between the two different kinds of windows .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1766.99	Yeah , so so there's a couple of those little things as we Yeah , exact It's beautiful .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	exact	[]	[]	[]
1799.27	If you have like a particular w window that you want me to mimic its behaviour , then like just find it in the programme and just say , okay , just how this one does it .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1816.63	So then I can just sorta trace back and figure out what objects they are and bring 'em into here .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	trace	[]	[]	[]
1940.86	To actually look for the terms we're not loading it on a val of seventy six I mean or seventy five , whatever it is .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1946.15	Um so the r the results from that will , you know , narrow down what we're gonna use for the local search .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	narrow	[]	[]	[]
1953.08	Then we'll just do the local search on those ones that are chosen .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2184.98	I mean just get work done .	EN2002d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
33.49	'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time .	ES2011b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[Kay]
37.97	Um hope your sessions went well .	ES2011b.A.words.xml	hope	[]	[]	[]
67.24	Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet .	ES2011b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
73.18	Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this sure .	ES2011b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
345.0	Just move right on .	ES2011b.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
848.99	Do Let's I guess we should yeah make some 	ES2011b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
922.79	And if if you consider our budget , it probably if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .	ES2011b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
969.1	So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can right .	ES2011b.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
998.61	So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals .	ES2011b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1282.02	We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well .	ES2011b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1388.94	Like you could just have 	ES2011b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1483.98	So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next But we'll hold off on that 'cause 	ES2011b.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
1553.55	Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , um yeah , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting .	ES2011b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1570.94	See you soon .	ES2011b.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
111.94	Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
120.15	Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information about So I'm gonna keep this short , since we had a technical problem .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	share	[]	[]	[]
126.76	So skip through this .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
132.2	Every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you have we have the SMARTboards here .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
139.73	We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
152.83	Like you see here , I'll just take the take here .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
165.34	You can just draw whatever you want .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
168.62	It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	erase	[]	[]	[]
173.06	And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
199.68	So I'll take this out .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
206.05	We'll use that later .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
215.54	I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
234.8	Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
245.93	So , draw us your favourite animal .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
252.35	Draw us a technical animal .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	Draw	[]	[]	[]
309.58	Let's go easy on it .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
348.84	Show us an animal .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	Show	[]	[]	[]
353.28	Pick a pick a pick a clean sheet .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	Pick	[]	[]	[]
357.53	Take a clean sheet first .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
360.58	Just press next .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
583.44	Do everything to Uh really small , but together they're really strong .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
592.96	Just put 'em here .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
601.47	Think it need shoes .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
650.52	You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
659.95	See .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
666.35	Uh put this down .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
679.43	So what do you guys think about The first idea is just very short .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
682.43	I'll start with you .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
765.98	Um , let's see , where did I Let's skip that .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
778.79	Just go go for that .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
779.8	We'll reach the uh reach that profit .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
801.17	Or else we'll cut the meeting just cut the meeting short since we're supposed to stop .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	cut	[]	[]	[]
808.43	Anyways , the the personal coach will give you the your p your personal assignments and everything .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
813.12	So we'll just meet back in here thirty minutes .	TS3012a.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
736.97	Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L.C.D. remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T.V. to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V.C.R. and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance .	ES2003a.A.words.xml	programme	[]	[]	[L.C.D., T.V., V.C.R.]
1080.04	Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway .	ES2003a.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
521.26	Yep , okay , we can have soft excess .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
659.36	Let's keep flux in because it in most of these cases we've put flux in .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
822.49	I'll get this .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1078.95	You can point to the line wings .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
1165.95	Let's keep it in .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1224.13	Um hold on .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
1235.79	And galaxy .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	galaxy	[]	[]	[]
1265.12	Open that radius button .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	Open	[]	[]	[]
1341.73	I thought we had , we'd put in 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1437.47	Let's whatever's easiest for you .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1439.67	Y Um yes , take it out .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1466.61	Radio quiet quasar should be go mm 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[quasar, mm]
1526.32	Insert proper whatever the word is .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	Insert	[]	[]	[]
1600.26	Just keep H. beta , I think .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[H.]
1610.11	You can have flux .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1835.33	Otherwise they'd call it a name .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
1884.31	So they do mean iron line .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1892.23	Continuum flux we should have all in .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Continuum]
1966.71	Mm I'd put multiple in there .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2054.31	Yeah , you can point to that .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
2322.76	You can point to ionized emission rather than 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
2335.15	It it's pointing there and saying , look , there's a high excitation emission .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2440.64	You can point to the damped Lyman a alpha resorption , in in the same way you can point to H. beta emission , although H. beta emission is a process .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[Lyman, H., H.]
2473.8	What did we do back 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2479.4	Mm you can point to low red shift damped Lyman alpha absorption 'cause you're shifted in the spectrum there .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[Lyman]
2499.29	Quasars with H. beta absorption you'd put in .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[H.]
2576.34	But just talk about the micro-quasar .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
2672.08	Because the acronym has star burst in it uh galaxies in it , in the S. , and if the acronym includes its 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	burst	[]	[]	[S.]
2861.88	Yes , we did decide Keck was going in .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[Keck]
2975.39	And more to the point , can I get to it without going ah , I can carry my little bits in the with me .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2980.81	Excuse me , camera , I need to find the bin .	EN2006b.B.words.xml	Excuse	[]	[]	[bin]
98.52	But you can tell what they're about based on the other texts on the site , the texts on the things they're linked to , so what I wanted to know was can you combine the topic models that the pages , that have lots of text on them , with something else that that tells you what a page that has no or very little text on it based on the links , yeah .	IN1005.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
117.54	So quite simply if you have a page one which is like a home page , and that'll maybe have five links and a picture on it , and then because it links to page two and page three .	IN1005.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
182.59	So I basically came up with an algorithm that's just a i it plugs P.L.S.A. uh plugs page rank into P.L.S.A. , right , so page rank you basically just d uh say 	IN1005.B.words.xml	rank	[]	[P.L.S.A., P.L.S.A.]	[]
251.12	Uh sum over all the links into Z. of page rank 	IN1005.B.words.xml	sum	[]	[]	[Z.]
281.03	uh is equal to , and you can use the same sort of thing .	IN1005.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
326.51	So that alpha thing is how much do you trust the text on the page , and how much do you trust the links .	IN1005.B.words.xml	trust	[]	[]	[]
334.8	So what I did then was try this on a big database of web pages .	IN1005.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
367.28	How do you tell that this page because you don't know where the topics are , 'cause they're learned automatically , uh so 	IN1005.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
509.6	It was to do with cars basically , if you have you have a topic that's uh representing 	IN1005.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
519.14	cars , and you can tell that that's representing cars by looking at this distribution , and it's the same for both .	IN1005.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
524.21	Now you wanna tell which i i this page , uh Pedro's example of what it was , is that is says on the page Lotus Elise .	IN1005.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[wanna, Pedro, Lotus, Elise]
697.68	Uh thi this these labels , the Yahoo categories , that's that's a clustering .	IN1005.B.words.xml	thi	[]	[]	[Yahoo]
959.42	Uh but but you you can extend that up , even if you have a hundred categories , P.L.S.A. can find a hundred clusters that are a good clustering , but are completely unrelated to the directory .	IN1005.B.words.xml	extend	[]	[P.L.S.A.]	[]
1133.92	Yeah , i it's the same thing , like it it does tell you whether this uh which clustering is better for this task , but it doesn't tell you which clustering better represents the pages necessarily .	IN1005.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1270.43	But uh what I'd thought before was could you get people to evaluate this by by hand basically , could you give people a set of pages and like say you did it with five topics for example .	IN1005.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1291.6	Try give the user these pieces of paper to get an idea of what these topics are , that's this P. of W. given Z. .	IN1005.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[P., W., Z.]
1388.85	See , the the thing about web pages I thought as well in that getting humans to evaluate it in some way is that you have most of the web pages that are uh well a lot of the web pages that are important in some way are are are home pages , so Google dot com doesn't actually say the words search on it , I think .	IN1005.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[Google]
1407.87	I maybe it says go , but you only know it's about search through the thing , but someone looking at it can tell that it's a search engine , because of the way it's laid out , because of the pictures on it and because of all of that .	IN1005.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1764.04	But anyway , uh tha that's often the case , when you look at it you can tell very clearly that one or two topics are a b not the rest , yeah .	IN1005.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
2038.77	Um so I thought you wanna probably set this alpha per page , there's probably some heuristics , for example this page , there's no text in it , will set it very low in user information for the links .	IN1005.B.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[]
2097.38	Yeah , maybe do it by cross-validation , something .	IN1005.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2169.39	You can do it with some heuristics and you can learn it from the task results in or combine the two , so tha that's kinda straightforward , I think .	IN1005.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2217.98	And people running this style of algorithm , the page rank style stuff , generally run it on about two million or twenty million pages , or whatever .	IN1005.B.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[algorithm]
2669.49	The cool thing about that is that if you've got two Gaussians , you can tell how close they are .	IN1005.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[Gaussians]
2678.13	So you can have as many as you like , uh and you can tell that they're close to each other , so there's load of ideas that I had about this uh in that if you can tell that two topic distributions are close to each other .	IN1005.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2737.75	I'll send you guys the link for that correlated topic model stuff if you want , but uh I don't know if it's too interesting to you .	IN1005.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
2751.19	Maybe I can do more with this .	IN1005.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
44.6	Just do it on the arrow .	ES2010a.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
688.52	Like statement , statement , reject , accept , you know , something like that .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	reject	[]	[]	[]
977.73	So modelling modelling a single contribution by a single speaker , you can within that you can use R.S.T. if you want to , right .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[R.S.T.]
1030.17	So we should look at at what they are .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1112.41	Uh p poss possibly , but few people have tried to , you know , do the kind of um truth conditional semantics that , you know , Asher and Lascarides have done , right .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Asher, Lascarides]
1125.05	So the theory can handle the kinds of things that happen in meetings , as she explained .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	handle	[]	[]	[]
1183.94	'Cause she did represent um discourse structures 'cause these were the Verbmobil scheduling dialogues .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	represent	[]	[]	[Verbmobil]
1233.16	But from that you c one would hope you would pull out something high , you know 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	hope	[]	[]	[]
1274.64	But it might make much more , you know , I mean 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1291.29	try to find a theory that allows multiple speakers and relations to span over more than one spea you know .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1457.19	I mean you can also think about the sort of joint problem solving kinds of um approaches .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2607.84	you may think that they're missing something , then we we could certainly augment them .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2644.46	Um but Nate Blaylock tried to um , you know , define , 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	define	[]	[]	[Nate, Blaylock]
2657.36	Well , you can adopt it , you can well I can't remember you know , okay , but he has uh he has a taxonomy yeah , right .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	adopt	[]	[]	[]
2695.55	And then you can also look at , you know , cl you know Clark on joint action .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[Clark]
2787.15	Yeah , th I mean it it does seem like , you know , there's something that we want from that and then there's something that we want from collaborative problem solving .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	seem	[]	[]	[]
3288.97	I mean and to ask questions , like who disagreed or were there any counter proposals or whatever .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
3352.96	I mean , you know , those , you know , strike me as cl clear things that , you know , people who go to decision making meetings want to know if they've missed one or are arriving late or anything like that .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	strike	[]	[]	[]
3720.71	So um I mean we'll we'll get that back on track .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
3756.49	Well I think when he does re when he does lear these learning experiments , he should do 'em two ways .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
3762.61	Because he will have this opportunity with or without .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3785.07	Um so I think if we have those features , it's , you know , it's a rare orp or rare opportunity that you can , you know , you can try one head to head against the other .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
3795.56	Um and then of course to make sure that you really um 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
3814.72	So we might do the sort of open domain , I mean a although it will be a closed domain , I mean we we can't use any domain information necessarily .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
3855.57	Sure , so we might find that when we move from what we thought was open domain , but on the hub , you know , our results go down when we truly are getting meeting yeah .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
3993.19	And I mean it seems to me that chunking should have some kind of so if if your dialogue act segmenter says there's there's a segment here , but your chunker said no , this is a coherent chunk , then y y you know , w I mean maybe they could work together to do a better job than 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[segmenter]
4114.52	Okay , if there if there was if there was hand labelled data that you could evaluate again so train on some and evaluate on some , wouldn't that um 'cause you've trained on Switchboard , right , where there there are chunks .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	train	[]	[]	[Switchboard]
4139.18	Maybe you'd use some chunked ICSI stuff as development or something and do some last tweaks and then evaluate .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[ICSI]
4343.99	So you can look at Redwoods parses 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[Redwoods]
4353.34	And you might wanna talk to Alex to find out if somebody's already done this turn Redwoods stuff into tree-bank stuff so that they can compare , you know , against results that are reported on tree-bank .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[Alex]
4521.72	So you can look at that and see what the parse trees look like .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
4599.19	Okay , so I trained on eighty eight and then or I train on one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and Okay , but we should speak to Steve .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	speak	[]	[]	[Steve]
4610.06	We might have some um 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
4641.45	Well we'd wanna make sure we're pretty happy that it's reliable because 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
4721.95	So we could talk to Vasilis about that as well .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[Vasilis]
4855.59	I can send you a l 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
4873.14	And Jean , probably maybe you should do the same .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Jean]
5087.89	And and so that would give us some ideas about , you know , what people want , you know , out of meeting records .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
5095.74	But then we should also add things that we think are interesting .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
5169.67	They they've I think they may have written this up um in a report um , but I wou would hope that's on the work package six web site as well .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	hope	[]	[]	[]
5203.76	I mean you may take it into account and say no , you're wrong , and here's why , but I I I'm gonna need some convincing .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
5236.27	So maybe we get together again in the yeah , I mean , I'll send them the references immediately .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
5270.08	So we should get together probably in about four weeks , yes .	EN2005a.D.words.xml	get	[about four weeks]	[]	[]
61.48	'Kay , and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control .	ES2010c.A.words.xml	reiterate	[]	[]	[Kay]
72.27	Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations .	ES2010c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
831.5	Let's go back to um Now we have to make some decisions .	ES2010c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1109.84	Oh what did you Oh sorry , go ahead .	ES2010c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1154.67	If this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , I think .	ES2010c.A.words.xml	produce	[]	[]	[]
1206.87	They could buy cases , maybe , 	ES2010c.A.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1332.91	Could it run off of two 	ES2010c.A.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[]
1635.34	I can find it again .	ES2010c.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
174.88	It depends which data you use as well because um if you use the data where they're all really high , it does prefer ones from the beginning because it just picks the first ones it finds .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
189.38	But I'll check it out anyway .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
232.71	Like um for the next couple of days I'll do some on it , 'cause I was just too busy last week .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	do	[the next couple of days, last week]	[]	[]
540.12	So maybe we should just omit them then .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	omit	[]	[]	[]
566.54	Okay , so maybe we should leave them out then .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
779.63	So it did work .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
804.11	Like we're looking at atlas , you'd expect to score quite high .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	expect	[]	[]	[atlas]
864.69	Yeah , I'll do the first thing I'll do is make a load box for selecting a file 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
886.98	But we'll have parameter for that .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
976.01	I can rope people in to to doing it , a few people at least .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	rope	[]	[]	[]
1023.55	We should probably write some user documentation 'cause I bet that will get us marks .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1029.96	Yeah , they'd love that kind of stuff .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	love	[]	[]	[]
1032.47	Just we'll just write , you know , little help files or something .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1085.52	Well we should wait till we have it ready for um you guys to use .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1089.86	Then we'll put it back in the group directory .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1094.66	So I'll try and do that today .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	try	[today]	[]	[]
1176.82	Hopefully we can take over that right one 'cause we don't need it .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1222.75	Can you send me a link to that paper so that I'll implement that in summarizer .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1332.32	And as long as I can test the script like once and it's working fine , I can just make it return dummy stuff so it works on other machines .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1354.41	I can change the script .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1355.56	So if I'm using my one at home , I can just add S.S.H. stuff in to ev evoke the sound tools on the uh on DICE and then copy 'em back .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[S.S.H., DICE]
1413.76	If it comes to it , I'll just um install NetBeans and stuff on my Linux machine and work on that .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	install	[]	[]	[Linux]
1431.92	just it'll just work hopefully .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1748.67	You can try and set something on the clock and use try and catch , and then if you catch the exceptions set the flag .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1813.79	We could put those on display .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1897.68	'Cause otherwise you might risk cutting bits off .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	risk	[]	[]	[]
1909.93	By half second you'll miss words .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	miss	[]	[]	[]
1938.77	Oh yeah , I can yeah , I can do that .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2156.04	Obviously we'll hide that in the presentation .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	hide	[]	[]	[]
2209.33	So you can have happy faces and angry faces .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2266.4	And I'll make us t to read it in .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2279.26	So I could probably I could probably read it from uh that file already .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
2285.66	My preferred would be dialogue act number , then you can put both the scores in one file .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2292.25	You can put both the scores in one file if it makes it easier .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2306.25	So I'll read that into um I'll make it part of the get measure thing .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
2311.68	So you can just get it with a flag 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2509.13	So it'd only matter if it occurs on ones that are really highly ranked .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	matter	[]	[]	[]
2529.3	Well otherwise you'd get icons all over the place .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2574.17	We'd want to rate them as how important they were , wouldn't we .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2640.16	So yeah , we'd probably want to merge ones that were very close into one .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2654.73	Yeah , and we should probably make some logic when it displays it that says if there's ones very close together , it just centres it among the 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2799.41	Maybe we should um download a dictionary and check our utterances before we uh listen to make sure that they're actually real words .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	download	[]	[]	[]
2912.87	Just draw a big black line on the borders , I think .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2925.05	'Cause it ju it can display from any utterance to any other utterance .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
2939.0	Yeah , I'd prefer them drawn continuously .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
3027.99	knowledge it would need .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
3033.97	But anyway , we can sort that out if we have time once we've got everything else .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	sort	[]	[]	[]
3046.32	That'll get s s sufficient to claim that we had implemented some kind of zoom as well .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
3099.07	Basically do a code for ease on it .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
3104.12	Um I'll probably tonight just work on getting a frozen version that works consistently .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
3110.68	And um if you could document it for me , that's probably enough for me to add it in .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	document	[]	[]	[]
3175.22	detect where the mouse is and change the default tool tip for that component .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	detect	[]	[]	[]
3210.69	I'll have a look through some of my Java books 'cause it might be the sort of thing they have in there .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Java]
3245.36	So I'll start working on that in like half an hour or something and it will be the 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
3326.54	Yeah , we can get them .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
3437.15	I we maybe you should present it on your laptop 'cause we can be really sure it's running before we come .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[]
3449.67	I could probably get my computer in if I could get someone to give me a lift .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
3515.2	No , but Cygwin should run um the Java as well .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[Cygwin, Java]
3566.87	Yep , I'll do that today .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	do	[today]	[]	[]
3568.7	And I'll yeah , I'll make a script to run it and put that in the group directory .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
3574.44	And I'll send around the email when it's done .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
3709.5	Do we want when you click on a search result , we definitely want that one to appear in the summary .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
3770.92	Uh and also the real time and play time stuff would change .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
3815.49	So may we probably want a different summary constructor that takes an an additional argument of an I.D. .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[I.D.]
3869.71	But you could d you can um achieve the same effect .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	achieve	[]	[]	[]
3881.62	Probably the way to handle that would be to make a summary that's the same length as the selection , and that would ensure that the search term came up .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	ensure	[]	[]	[]
3929.21	But we'll have that slider obviously .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3954.44	And I'll start work in say two .	EN2001e.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
32.64	Let's see .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
35.95	First I will introduce myself .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	introduce	[]	[]	[]
65.58	Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
70.37	They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	record	[]	[]	[]
99.19	Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
112.06	Let's do it read only .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
149.67	Uh maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or Let's see .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[]
161.34	Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
356.82	You can save .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
368.97	Uh select a pen , eraser .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
389.28	You can also select the current colour and the line width .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
428.95	And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[wanna]
440.97	It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
447.51	You can switch between the different drawings .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
461.19	Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
478.29	And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	sum	[]	[]	[]
497.87	You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
590.63	And then you can undo 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	undo	[]	[]	[]
711.94	Go ahead .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
843.07	Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1088.18	So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[white, board]
1111.25	move along to the project finance .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
1137.75	Uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1170.61	So just try to remember these points .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1287.77	And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	program	[]	[]	[]
1296.53	And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	operate	[]	[]	[]
1342.5	So we've we want different functions 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1370.4	Maybe we can make it uh uh 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1395.0	Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1436.8	Kick off presentation .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	Kick	[]	[]	[]
1443.76	Okay , then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1449.35	and then we can all work .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1455.18	And we can all work uh on our own projects .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1468.18	Okay then I'll meet you in about a half an hour , I think .	TS3003a.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
28.29	Roo , welcome back .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	welcome	[]	[]	[]
64.55	People , welcome back with the second meeting .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	welcome	[]	[]	[]
102.13	Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
111.66	Um we will figure that out .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
114.87	Ca can you try to 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
124.98	Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
214.66	So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
386.53	Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	s	[]	[]	[]
794.79	Okay , go on .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1009.99	Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1022.28	Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , because that's his his field of expertise .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Sebastian]
1117.77	Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1167.39	Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1287.75	Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1298.29	Yeah , draw draw it on the board .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1327.96	Yeah , it can break down .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	break	[]	[]	[]
1424.68	Um well , for we do have to uh decide this this meeting .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1493.37	Okay , well um m maybe I should write that down .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1552.44	And and do we want um 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1594.34	But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1620.56	You c you can d make them very fancy by um 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1673.35	To find yeah .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1683.75	If if we would um drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume , because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
1701.61	But we do focus on younger people .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
2029.36	Maybe you will get some information on that .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2044.48	Um for now we will have the lunch break .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2053.81	Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2063.77	Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2067.64	If you want to look at it um well , just do .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2142.8	We can decide the next meeting .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
2162.18	uh will change , adapt and um so we will see that .	TS3011b.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
642.09	I'll add it later , I guess the presentation .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
770.6	Try that again .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
774.0	Wait .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
801.44	Increase that 'cause we can't see the 	ES2002b.A.words.xml	Increase	[]	[]	[]
1343.33	So maybe we should I suggest that we think about speech recognition , anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[]
1414.22	Sorry , do you mind passing me my notepad .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	mind	[]	[]	[]
1428.71	Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1477.09	Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , so I'll go into the diagram first .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1495.88	'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[Kay]
1516.58	That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1535.1	You know , and that um picks up an input from a user , um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A. , so I will do something with button A. .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1798.86	You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1920.36	Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[]
1949.66	I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
1959.55	I mean it might help with the visualisation .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
1961.85	And it would actually help with the component build as well .	ES2002b.A.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
142.83	You can write on the paper , yeah .	IN1013.C.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
59.14	sen oh stand-by .	TS3011a.B.words.xml	stand	[]	[]	[sen]
60.33	Close the the window .	TS3011a.B.words.xml	Close	[]	[]	[]
662.88	You should feed that uh that animal .	TS3011a.B.words.xml	feed	[]	[]	[]
904.5	Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .	TS3011a.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
1032.15	Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T.V.s or even different uh um 	TS3011a.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[Sebastian, T.V.s]
1110.95	Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .	TS3011a.B.words.xml	wh	[]	[]	[]
1122.41	It just should change the T.V.'s state .	TS3011a.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1167.05	Uh point at a T.V. , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T.V. , so you must point everywhere , so maybe infrared is 	TS3011a.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
1243.94	You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think .	TS3011a.B.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
1345.23	Well , maybe I um but it it can be quite simple , you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .	TS3011a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1384.9	Just remind something .	TS3011a.B.words.xml	remind	[]	[]	[]
67.55	Um so first of all , just to kind of make sure that we all know each other , I'm Laura and I'm the project manager .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Laura]
108.96	Um yeah so des uh design a new remote control .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[des]
147.92	And repeat that process three times .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	repeat	[]	[]	[]
151.79	Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
285.96	You can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
290.31	Ok oh we do we do .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
357.54	But I'll just draw a different kind of dog .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
524.21	the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
565.93	Well for a remote control , do you think that will be I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
711.43	Let me just scoot on ahead here .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
772.8	Five minutes to end of meeting .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	end	[]	[]	[]
847.62	Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a Oh that's a good idea .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
883.05	Um okay , uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	wel	[the next couple of minutes]	[]	[]
889.88	Um I'll just check we've nothing else .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
977.17	Right , well um so just to wrap up , the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	wrap	[]	[]	[]
996.69	Um for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do .	ES2002a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
729.82	Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip .	ES2010b.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
733.92	Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart .	ES2010b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
849.45	Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to .	ES2010b.B.words.xml	communicate	[]	[]	[red]
884.4	We can skip that whole thing .	ES2010b.B.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
887.85	So you can put it in the dark .	ES2010b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1012.23	You can also get the kind of the T.V. guide so 	ES2010b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1137.63	Most of them will intuitively pick it up though .	ES2010b.B.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
1274.37	And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you .	ES2010b.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
1084.16	It would make sense to do that .	EN2001d.E.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1110.31	If yeah , if if you can pass me like the dialogue act with 	EN2001d.E.words.xml	pass	[]	[]	[]
1384.01	Yeah , it w it would look good .	EN2001d.E.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1408.46	Yeah , I suppose you could calculate them off-line and just , yeah , have a like like a l little thumbnail or something .	EN2001d.E.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1418.2	I mean it would be a bit pointless , but it would look good for the presentation .	EN2001d.E.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1751.49	Yeah , he did give us eight out of ten though .	EN2001d.E.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2313.44	Remember how did I do it .	EN2001d.E.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
3346.18	Yeah , I may as well come and you can show me how it the manager works .	EN2001d.E.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
256.75	You should try it , I don't know .	IN1012.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
282.4	Train north .	IN1012.D.words.xml	Train	[]	[]	[]
394.77	We can take the tram and a train .	IN1012.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
563.68	Maybe I can find it .	IN1012.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
576.4	Make it possible to use uh a full covariance matrix .	IN1012.D.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
670.18	No , but in the proceedings you can find them .	IN1012.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1361.25	How did you cope with what you mentioned some time before , that if it's a very long session for each twelve point five frame you will actually get the same segment now .	IN1012.D.words.xml	cope	[]	[]	[]
2023.91	So maybe well , but then well no , if somebody like NIST will have one recogniser and you just plug a different feature , but uh it's dangerous .	IN1012.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[NIST]
2517.47	But there you could send an S.M.S. I think , or something like that .	IN1012.D.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
2520.51	Uh you could dictate text , so .	IN1012.D.words.xml	dictate	[]	[]	[]
70.89	Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh just as vital to this project um I'll just go round th the table , Andrew , marketing , um m Kendra with the uh um designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design .	ES2012a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Andrew, Kendra, User, Interface, Kate]
123.9	Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for a while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh uh everybody's experience is please do so .	ES2012a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
153.32	in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make .	ES2012a.A.words.xml	welcome	[]	[]	[]
164.1	So we'll start with Andrew .	ES2012a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[Andrew]
324.99	The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production .	ES2012a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
616.08	Yeah d no I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control , people won't see it as a remote control um and uh 	ES2012a.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
719.28	fi find the button buttons easily .	ES2012a.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
729.96	Yeah , that's uh must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's uh certainly be different .	ES2012a.A.words.xml	admit	[]	[]	[]
739.18	Um do we need it to uh I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all .	ES2012a.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
749.85	Do we do we want uh 	ES2012a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
993.96	might need so .	ES2012a.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1079.75	start looking at the um at the design in more detail .	ES2012a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1091.93	then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh 	ES2012a.A.words.xml	reconvene	[]	[]	[]
208.3	Hold that .	IS1000a.A.words.xml	Hold	[]	[]	[]
703.49	So do cats .	IS1000a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
814.33	You can probably reach .	IS1000a.A.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
1368.18	Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use .	IS1000a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1413.11	So try and get T.V. manufacturers to 	IS1000a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[T.V.]
168.41	I will do something like that .	IN1014.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
194.38	The third one yeah , maybe I can share that with you .	IN1014.B.words.xml	share	[]	[]	[]
210.83	The first one is yeah , I will call that A. .	IN1014.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
287.55	The third one is call uh the third one is uh the project that I have to improve the current smart meeting room at IDIAP .	IN1014.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[IDIAP]
295.76	Uh for that we will use um uh 	IN1014.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
342.86	So I will start just with the SMAC .	IN1014.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[SMAC]
396.3	On these four inputs you can have only video .	IN1014.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
414.88	to video .	IN1014.B.words.xml	video	[]	[]	[]
430.2	Now I will just move .	IN1014.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
436.52	You can use uh them .	IN1014.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
890.85	So we can have both .	IN1014.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
892.88	We can have the slide from the slide capture and we can just use uh a video signal to to capture that also .	IN1014.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
921.24	Yeah , we can just take some snapshots .	IN1014.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1095.0	So they develop something to synchronize these two cards together and th uh this is something which is it's more , w which is call uh direct show , 	IN1014.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
1210.32	I will write .	IN1014.B.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1231.62	So maybe first I will just describe the ma the smart meeting room that we have at IDIAP .	IN1014.B.words.xml	describe	[]	[]	[ma, IDIAP]
1279.66	If we look at the video in fact um yeah , maybe first I should mention that .	IN1014.B.words.xml	mention	[]	[]	[]
1390.17	And um so we will have here video .	IN1014.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1640.45	And any device we which wants to send a package a p a packet , sorry , should ask um there is a manager of that bus .	IN1014.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1661.55	uh require some uh band-width on the bus on the bus .	IN1014.B.words.xml	require	[]	[]	[]
1666.44	And so after that he will have that band-width .	IN1014.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1670.31	And he will always have that band-width .	IN1014.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1674.21	So um yeah , he will always have that band-width .	IN1014.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1717.9	I I as I mentioned before , we have a bus manager and the bus manager send just a flag to say now it's time to give me you data , and all devices which have uh required some band-width will send the data .	IN1014.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[width]
1741.59	And just after that bus just after that uh signal all device will send uh the data .	IN1014.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1750.05	So we will have the data from A. , from B. and from C. and so on .	IN1014.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[A., B., C.]
1754.38	And after the next one we will have again the um 	IN1014.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1780.47	We can put what we want inside .	IN1014.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1782.51	So we can put raw data , or we can send a DivX data , or we can send also uh what I uh was presenting in my term presentation was a H. two six four .	IN1014.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[DivX, H.]
1816.49	Do you have any quest 	IN1014.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2060.43	Um so we can play with the video .	IN1014.B.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
2062.92	We can play with the slide .	IN1014.B.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
2135.04	M I should check .	IN1014.B.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
2331.07	So I will start with that to develop some knowledge regarding that board , uh that video board , and after that we can combine both .	IN1014.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
2437.37	April , May we should have results .	IN1014.B.words.xml	have	[April , May]	[]	[]
2557.79	Uh I.V.C. I.V.C. should go faster .	IN1014.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[I.V.C., I.V.C.]
2573.59	I will start to work on January on that point .	IN1014.B.words.xml	start	[January]	[]	[]
2898.57	But people will stay will continue to say no no , you will find time just to do that project .	IN1014.B.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
2994.26	No , I will work fully on that on this point .	IN1014.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
3331.97	But I think yeah , that will be good , just to have a plan and to have some deadline in that plan .	IN1014.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3424.94	Yeah , and to improve the system like 	IN1014.B.words.xml	improve	[]	[]	[]
3580.02	After that I can move to another one .	IN1014.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
3632.4	But you can have you can ask for a student , a d a diploma work .	IN1014.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
776.08	Yeah , because even to download that much of data 	IN1002.A.words.xml	download	[]	[]	[]
883.36	And then we we need to train the new rates because M.L.P. training needs to be done , and then only the next step will happen .	IN1002.A.words.xml	happen	[]	[]	[M.L.P.]
896.23	Whether we can replicate the results , whatever results you are showing , whether we can replicate them or not .	IN1002.A.words.xml	replicate	[]	[]	[]
1059.39	So you tha M.L.P. needs to be trained and uh P.L.P. features , so it's kind of one and a half days work , kind of , to generate the new files .	IN1002.A.words.xml	generate	[one and a half days]	[]	[M.L.P., P.L.P.]
1144.96	So RAID five you have told to the 	IN1002.A.words.xml	RAID	[]	[]	[]
1290.6	No no , insurance can take care of uh means anything can be insured in this world nowadays .	IN1002.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1468.33	Then only they'll ask you that this is the quotation .	IN1002.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1481.62	No no no , first they'll give you a quotation .	IN1002.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1490.23	Yeah yeah , because in the beginning what they say that send us the thing , we'll look at the things .	IN1002.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1495.6	If it is recoverable , we will tell you what is the quotation , and if it is not recoverable , we will send it back to you .	IN1002.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1524.21	Accordingly they will tell you whether they can recover or not .	IN1002.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1610.11	If one disk has crashed crashed , then you can recover everything .	IN1002.A.words.xml	recover	[]	[]	[]
1744.37	So might be what I can do I can give you the setup and you can you can generate from bottom , train M.L.P. , test M.L.P. .	IN1002.A.words.xml	train	[]	[]	[M.L.P., M.L.P.]
1983.94	Uh they'll get a shock of their life .	IN1002.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2033.34	If they can yeah , if they can give me my C. files , then also it's okay .	IN1002.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[C.]
2442.67	Have a good day .	IN1002.A.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
224.61	I'll buy it .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
396.9	You mean we can change the colour uh of th 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
501.07	Let's see if this Yeah , if you meet 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
555.28	Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
579.97	I'm going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
587.92	And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
685.83	Change colour , I mean that's very 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	Change	[]	[]	[]
710.39	Let's try .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1059.98	So you can fit into your palm , okay .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1145.47	Say no .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
1203.95	Let's do a single curve .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1244.15	Let's stick to s titan .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[titan]
1323.72	It should stay .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
1375.38	We can just use this red .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1507.77	Nobody will know .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1542.47	So , remove one of them .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	remove	[]	[]	[]
1562.54	Uh , I would say it's the Russian trick , but Anyway No , they may have some their origins , strange origins 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1584.76	Let's finish this meeting instead .	IS1006d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
15.21	Well should we just go around and everyone says what they d what they've been doing , how far they've got .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
51.42	We've go a browser we've um which comes up automatically with a transcription box and the topics .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
59.35	And then when you go on the menu , you can select a summarisation box , which pops up , and an audio player .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
68.79	Um and a s I think the search works as well , so you could pop up a search .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	pop	[]	[]	[]
109.58	Either we can when you click on the the I.D. , any sort of I.D. in the transcription box , or we can put an extra button extra few buttons next to the summarise button so that you actually in the transcription box , but so like you click on a button and then that opens whatever that speaker characterisation is .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	put	[]	[I.D.]	[I.D.]
152.91	Um I think so yeah , when you left-click it , you can for example set set the marker there so that the mm the audio goes from there , I think .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[mm]
164.34	We could put it on a right-click .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
166.38	We could for example have a little menu that pops up .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
170.64	So right-click on at menu , you know , and you can click on speaker characterisation , up pops the window .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
272.71	Yeah , so y when you right-click on it , one one option will be give me all your meetings , characterise the speaker 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
369.33	So should we try try to do a right-click when you then 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
387.53	Wait .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
399.55	So we could do that in a similar way , do it right-click as well .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
402.78	And to have a different menu for our 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
517.63	Well I'll I'll check what it does on on um double-click at the moment .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
532.32	I mean if you can think of something that 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
570.83	I mean we might use them while wo to work with them , but do we wanna integrate them in so that when you browse you can here's 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
641.39	You open the window , you read through it , you might click on you know , close it again straight-away .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
691.93	I can have a look .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
756.37	Yeah , you can minimise 'em .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	minimise	[]	[]	[]
786.74	Put the summaries in in the same window .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
926.32	Right , well I'll make that readable then .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1106.73	I mean you should look at look have a look at the the browser code then , because um , you know , they already extract for example transcripts .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1115.09	Put it into a window at least .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
1247.37	To get the data i for example to get the summarisation data , you have to search for I think the I.D.s or something .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1277.55	Oh it does load up quite quickly .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
1280.9	But you know , you could have a look at them .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1290.92	This is just when you open what you know , to load the transcript for example , to find the transcript for a certain meeting , it does does an N.X.T. search for the string , I don't know , transcript or text or whatever .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[N.X.T.]
1350.04	Open .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	Open	[]	[]	[]
1379.32	Yeah , just search for a specific string .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	search	[]	[]	[]
1385.39	So you could just , you know , you could use that when you if you wanna um take the data out and put it somewhere .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1396.68	If you have a a question about w what the p the code means or where to find the code that you wanna , you know , whatever you wanna do , then just send me an email .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1406.84	I can explain it .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
1431.71	A lot of rubbish , but they will be get will be chucked out right at the end , I think .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1502.11	Well , I'll do that then .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1594.03	We can always decide then , I mean yeah .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1647.82	Weeks will go by and 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	go	[Weeks]	[]	[]
1684.44	Then we can write about it in the in the interim report , and s you know , and then we've got something to show .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1710.85	Maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you wanna be able to search for .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1718.14	And then if you want , you can give that to me and I'll I'll build a u nice , you know , a few tick-boxes and drop-down menus .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1791.35	That would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	involve	[]	[]	[]
1810.62	Know 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	Know	[]	[]	[]
1830.53	Yeah , I can do that .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1832.47	Show you what bits the code 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	Show	[]	[]	[]
1862.74	Pick a time .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	Pick	[]	[]	[]
1971.35	Rather than have half an hour and then we'll surely run out .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2048.55	Let's meet Monday .	EN2002a.C.words.xml	Let	[Monday]	[]	[]
146.26	So you should probably look at the 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
183.39	Okay , I'll do it .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
338.62	Um whatever you give me I can do it , I think .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
423.47	Although we could do th mm we could do the one highlighted I suppose .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
458.89	So you could you could zap through these topics uh meetings , sorry .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	zap	[]	[]	[]
464.2	And um and it would come up with how much they spoke and you can pick the one that s looks the most interesting .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
554.76	Then I could use that for the for the topic pop up window .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
682.32	Do you mean just the yeah , but it's not gonna take very long .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
756.9	Well just just tell me when , because I usually I usually work on my own copy for for the day and then update it without checking if th if the one in the one in the shared one has changed .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
824.43	You've got just look at the the what they wrote about it .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
849.03	That's the way I did it to to highlight , to cross-highlight between topic and then transcripts .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	cross	[]	[]	[]
937.64	So I can feel that in now .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
1010.16	So do we want yeah , maybe we could write an on like the whatever it's called , the the top of the window saying welcome to the meeting browser .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1051.97	I mean I think they should have two options , either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
1123.9	So let's say they have two options , either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
1296.71	And then you can decide well I wanna search on this and this and this meeting , or only on this meeting , or 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1476.21	Well , you know , you can you might have some general frequencies .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1508.92	Because that would be really handy then , we can actually test it on the user , as opposed to just doing it and not using it .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	test	[]	[]	[]
1548.48	Yeah , that would work .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1595.18	Sort of , but then the main idea was more like to to speed it up , speed the search up , because N.X.T. over the over the whole of the corpus was just not feasible .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	speed	[]	[]	[N.X.T.]
1635.66	Do that as well , that'd be really nice , yeah .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
1637.98	'Cause I mean then then it would give you like if you searched for a word , it would give you the the meetings , but also how often the w that word occurred in that meeting .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1711.03	And then and then ad add those up or something .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1714.13	How would you combine them , that's the question .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	combine	[]	[]	[]
1878.75	Yeah , just to give them an idea , general idea what there is and so they can pick a a to um a meeting .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1913.13	Look at that .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
1943.39	Because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting , y they can they can browse through that quite nicely .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	browse	[]	[]	[]
1977.61	Have a user model .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
2002.95	Let's see what's changed today .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	Let	[today]	[]	[]
2081.52	Yeah , or search , yeah .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	search	[]	[]	[]
2263.86	No , but you know , to to search for a u pecif pec specific user , you have to hold your mouse over that one , wait for it to pop up , hold your mouse on that one , wait for the pop Um 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	search	[]	[]	[pecif, pec]
2431.15	I mean uh I think I'm gonna do quite a bit of work this week , so I'll have probably more to talk about .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	have	[this week]	[]	[]
2449.07	Well , we can disc uh discuss that on Friday if we have one .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	disc	[Friday]	[]	[]
2515.72	Um what I oh , no no , that that would only give us like thirty five minutes or something .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2545.17	I'll write um I'll write this meeting up and I'll send it to Pernilla as well .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[Pernilla]
2566.12	Yeah , no , we should probably do that at end , depending on 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2658.28	No , but for things like if you search for language , then you might have you have some topics which have as a , you know n some some meetings which have as a topic language , they specifically speak about language , and they use that word like in every sentence .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2672.24	And then you've got those that just mention , you know , mention it briefly , like once or twice saying , you know , my language is German or something stupid that you don't really want .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	mention	[]	[]	[]
2693.26	Uh for multiple terms we can just do something really simple .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2720.28	Yeah , just just just disregard it , yeah .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	disregard	[]	[]	[]
2724.02	Yeah , I mean you'd you'd just do it really simply , you know .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2727.61	You'll have the results as before , but yeah , yeah .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2732.28	Can discuss it on Friday .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	discuss	[Friday]	[]	[]
2858.5	Well we'll discuss it again on Friday .	EN2002c.A.words.xml	discuss	[Friday]	[]	[]
105.61	So uh , if you could open the PowerPoint presentation .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
136.49	I'll take the mouse .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
295.09	And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we're we're currently uh proposing , uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
343.08	And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
374.49	I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
421.36	Let's go back up here .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
442.13	Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
515.94	And you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
604.02	It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
980.77	No , f go to findings .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1100.37	You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball , and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1121.09	To t an and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1131.23	Yes you'd know what kind of wood to get .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1143.75	Oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect , yeah .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
1186.72	We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna um learn about um labour laws .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1200.0	You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1209.45	So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device .	IS1008c.C.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
729.84	If you can come to the 	IS1008b.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
765.8	I'll explain myself here now in the sense that uh 	IS1008b.D.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
785.69	Now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive , but give them added things that they don't have now , then it w it could possibly sell .	IS1008b.D.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
855.45	So maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's a beep beep beep , and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home .	IS1008b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
871.35	But if it's trendy , if it's fancy , it's got some colour to it , if it's very easy easy to use , if it's got simple remote speech remote uh control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause I can't turn the T.V. on .	IS1008b.D.words.xml	find	[half a day]	[]	[T.V.]
167.42	Yeah , we could because this could be just some uh a little just just describe some screen-shots or something .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	describe	[]	[]	[]
183.61	Yeah , you can either have and we can just ignore that bit .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
185.35	Or you can have 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
191.59	Yeah , you can either have the Yeah , it says screen-shot there and stuff .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
193.91	But th you can either have screen-shots by the thing , each one , or um have just a bunch of 'em in one session .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
223.55	Do we d 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	d	[]	[]	[]
264.08	Th you can you can perfect it and 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	perfect	[]	[]	[]
286.21	Sleep , sleep , food , sleep .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	Sleep	[]	[]	[]
311.35	Sabotage it .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	Sabotage	[]	[]	[]
362.26	Stick in the conclusion of the final report .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	Stick	[]	[]	[]
392.95	than worry about 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	worry	[]	[]	[]
416.27	You have should have a section probably .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
472.98	Give me a week and I'll tell you the answer to that .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	Give	[a week]	[]	[]
479.0	Or maybe the speaker characterisation might get slimmer .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
520.69	Let's see what happens .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
712.09	get attributes , it returns a list of attributes .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
714.56	Search through those and and then it just you can that will tell you what attributes it's got .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
719.27	And then you can either do it automatically or you can just hard-code and say , look , get me the time stamps .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
731.45	And that will tell you the start times and end times .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
756.4	That should uh tell you what it is .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1213.98	You will very much limit what you can do with it if it's not in X.M.L. format .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	limit	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
1233.12	Oh , select what we want , just take bits of the X.M.L. and take only it takes certain segments .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
1261.2	But that will mean that you can only do things on actually no uh , 'cause you need to do things on word level .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1312.87	Then it will look ugly probably , 'cause it will look just black and white .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1367.89	You just fatten the code out a bit .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	fatten	[]	[]	[]
1452.83	So if we can do it with NITE stuff , do it with NITE stuff , I think .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1625.6	You might lose a bit of continuity if you do that , though .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
1728.28	She'll shine it .	EN2002b.B.words.xml	shine	[]	[]	[]
474.5	You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	watch	[]	[]	[]
502.46	Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[wanna]
636.15	See if I can find them .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
748.37	It you put uh put a black front on it or something .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
943.55	The average will uh come later .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
981.3	Kick it out .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	Kick	[]	[]	[]
999.0	Kick it out .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	Kick	[]	[]	[]
1105.53	You can make you can make it cheaper .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1183.47	people might buy .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1526.16	Yeah , think so too .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1556.67	And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1581.44	Yeah , but give me a beamer .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1669.71	That Stefan use .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[Stefan]
1780.56	For people who uh sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1824.45	Yeah , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , yeah , very precise 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2034.17	Do that .	TS3009d.D.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
209.61	So this detector uh detected the thirty shots , and if you click on uh plus button you can expand it and see the key frames that are in fact uh five extracted frames from the shot .	IN1001.B.words.xml	expand	[]	[]	[]
238.29	Um so I we can see the video actually , uh the entire video , can open with Real Player .	IN1001.B.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[Real, Player]
414.36	Yeah , maybe to explain this method was using uh a simple uh uh distance between uh consecutive histograms , and we didn't use motion features at all for that , that's why i we 	IN1001.B.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
493.76	I can show you uh 	IN1001.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
573.04	And the the motion features can better show what's going on when there is such a difficult uh transition , while with the histogram um , yeah , it just shows that there is a shot uh change at the end , but even for dissolves , I don't have examples here , but um there is not a strict uh transition .	IN1001.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
712.66	Okay , set the beginning .	IN1001.B.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[]
732.19	And then to detect uh the the the the changes , we we do a calculation um with points under this sliding window within this sliding window .	IN1001.B.words.xml	detect	[]	[]	[]
899.34	This is IDIAP laptop , so you can u okay .	IN1001.B.words.xml	u	[]	[]	[]
1009.8	Because yeah , one thing uh maybe we will talk about that is the library uh , it's uh it doesn't uh compile anymore on Debian machines and , yeah , some maybe some work has to be done on this .	IN1001.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
1140.02	Do you thi it's another kind of browsing page , but uh to be more precise about uh to to check maybe the this yeah , exactly , yeah , yeah .	IN1001.B.words.xml	thi	[]	[]	[]
1406.02	Maybe okay , we can uh see a little bit if you want , to play the 	IN1001.B.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1552.33	Because he did the movie , so he wants t okay , to archive , he wants to okay .	IN1001.B.words.xml	archive	[]	[]	[]
1624.44	Okay , I will play , yeah .	IN1001.B.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1770.67	Run the okay .	IN1001.B.words.xml	Run	[]	[]	[]
1786.61	I will have to check , but if it's five minutes videos , it's like done in yeah , quickly .	IN1001.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1856.31	So that we'll use the whiteboard .	IN1001.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1942.43	Uh okay , slash .	IN1001.B.words.xml	slash	[]	[]	[]
1980.86	Yeah , we can do the the get frame 	IN1001.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2008.13	And I could data dot X.M.L. , but in fact it's just a simple convention , I w could have put nothing , but I just put data .	IN1001.B.words.xml	data	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
2027.55	But in fact , yeah , when I think now , we could have uh 	IN1001.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2122.4	And every frame is stored into uh a b a backup in fact every frame um it's M.M.M. who manage this automatically , so that um when uh you ask for this frame , in fact we can okay , I just view frame source 	IN1001.B.words.xml	okay	[]	[]	[M.M.M.]
2168.46	From the video with a time stamp it outputs a J. PEG .	IN1001.B.words.xml	stamp	[]	[]	[J., PEG]
2282.76	So you go inside the get frame function , you see where it i it saves it , and then there is a special naming convention , and you can remove the but i it's c yeah , it's true .	IN1001.B.words.xml	remove	[]	[]	[]
2301.68	Because there it's in cache , so that if I put another video with the same name , they th they will happen again .	IN1001.B.words.xml	happen	[]	[]	[]
2310.58	They will uh appear , this frames will appear .	IN1001.B.words.xml	appear	[]	[]	[]
2333.27	But if you put yeah , in another directory , uh then it would work or or a new naming convention with uh special uh , yeah , code uh .	IN1001.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
2358.53	But it it can go in the browser cache also .	IN1001.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2478.31	Yes , we could do that .	IN1001.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2480.61	We could put uh CINETIS slash here , and then a CINETIS slash is the sa yeah , it works .	IN1001.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[CINETIS, CINETIS]
2507.99	Yeah , we w we copy all the files and there is uh just one um one parameter , one uh string , that we need to know where this data is , and we could pr create a M.M.M. data video browser uh CINETIS or something else .	IN1001.B.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[M.M.M., CINETIS]
2560.43	Yeah , to do list or something .	IN1001.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2720.93	a purely secure directory we p we we put a co code number like uh so that it's quite impossible to guess instead of video m uh name equals kayak then we would have uh zero six seven uh five or , you know , two .	IN1001.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2760.0	We should take care that this directory or in fact this directory is not listable , you know , you cannot list from outside uh with uh F.T.P. or H.T.T.P. .	IN1001.B.words.xml	take	[]	[H.T.T.P.]	[F.T.P.]
2864.54	We can forget tosh yeah .	IN1001.B.words.xml	forget	[]	[]	[]
2969.76	Leave it to one , yeah .	IN1001.B.words.xml	Leave	[]	[]	[]
2976.86	Maybe , I I will uh I will give you this file in uh as a rhy it's a kind of rhythmia , yeah .	IN1001.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
3027.02	Or even it can do it uh it can we can do it quite automatically .	IN1001.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
3077.58	You can use the free we have a license here at IDIAP , but uh the if you want to pay , you pay for options such as uh resize or cropping , but in fact maybe we don't need that , and uh it's called Elix producer .	IN1001.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[IDIAP, Elix]
3152.78	So that it can play uh smoothly and but we are still uh investigating for the video formats , because um i it's not supported for instance uh uh in Java , in Java applications uh etcetera .	IN1001.B.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[Java, Java]
3275.44	Shot begin and end .	IN1001.B.words.xml	begin	[]	[]	[Shot]
3352.84	Here uh I store the consecutive the distance between consecutive histograms , but we could uh store the matrix that's yeah .	IN1001.B.words.xml	store	[]	[]	[]
3441.93	Yeah , yeah , you can we can go .	IN1001.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
224.43	Find replace , yeah .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	Find	[]	[]	[]
270.83	How much should you want um I had a few times where I thought well , it could be this , but if you're not entirely sure that it could be , 'cause it c it could be a combination of something else , like put the guess down or leave it as ambiguous in some way .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
379.73	But if there's a chance that it's equally likely that they could have said something or they could have said something like ice cream and I scream , then just choose one and leave it , right .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
437.01	And uh I'll ask you later on like if you still have your notes .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
976.8	That'll give some transcriber a headache .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1009.43	It's easy to , 'cause you're so used to t t tuning them out , and you know it's easy when I go back over I normally g like go back to the beginning , do a quick pass of the main sections again and think ah yeah .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1119.02	Was she was that a like w r real definite I'm starting a new sentence here , 'cause I'd sometime if it sounds like he could carry on saying the whole sentence , I sometimes don't have a hyphen there .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	sometime	[]	[]	[]
1156.39	Oh goodness , who would know what that was uh if somebody that didn't know about linguistics were trying to transcribe S. node .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[S.]
1327.21	Would give Emacs a headache as well .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[Emacs]
1752.26	If somebody that , I'd point it out to them .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
1781.91	Yeah , 'cause otherwise you could end up putting a hyphen after every hesitation mark that you have .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	end	[]	[]	[]
1910.15	I know , I yeah , you could think of an argu 	EN2004a.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1920.09	Or should we start it if we start the conversation in the common room , like is laughter linguistic , then they could come up with a theory .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
2070.94	I I read somebody's P.H.D. proposals yesterday and s and it's saying , well , you could have a comma in here and one there and 	EN2004a.A.words.xml	have	[yesterday]	[]	[P.H.D.]
2540.38	Guess it depends how far you can stretch .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	Guess	[]	[]	[]
2542.97	Oh yeah , 'cause every time somebody'd be going over there you'd hear all this sound of 	EN2004a.A.words.xml	hear	[]	[]	[somebody'd]
3211.03	Um , you You'll know .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
3291.11	And if you can plug microphones into Apple Appleton Tower computers , I can do it there as well if you wanted me 	EN2004a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Apple, Appleton, Tower]
3300.32	We could meet up and have a session .	EN2004a.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
880.12	That way you have no storage , you have no um you do have transportation , still have the labour cost , but you don't have the transport to the uh point of sale .	IS1008d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
940.81	And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight .	IS1008d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1024.1	We probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it .	IS1008d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1286.56	And to work with motion pictures .	IS1008d.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1288.24	There might be some motion pictures that are coming out um that are coming out on D.V.D. that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , so we could maybe work out a campaign with uh with Sony Pictures for example .	IS1008d.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[D.V.D., Sony, Pictures]
79.03	It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
90.2	It should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
165.64	Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
180.1	Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
292.13	Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	confuse	[]	[]	[]
302.88	Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
322.18	the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
523.99	Uh menu th menu , uh one one .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	menu	[]	[]	[]
653.18	Or have two hands to operate it , yeah .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
739.33	Will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it 	IS1009d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
933.28	Oh go away .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
945.59	Come on .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
1031.73	Total seven point six whatever that means .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	Total	[]	[]	[]
1098.37	Save .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
1409.07	So to beware of that .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	beware	[]	[]	[]
1580.88	I'll give it a three .	IS1009d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
984.54	We could just go to my presentation .	IS1007c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1045.52	And then we can decide what what we can yeah .	IS1007c.D.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1113.32	if the remote control would look fancy .	IS1007c.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1191.11	We should have an L.C.D. on the rem remote control .	IS1007c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1221.24	So if we have a L.C.D. on the remote , rather than looking onto the T.V. you just look into a remote and navigate it .	IS1007c.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1464.21	And accordingly you can just increase or decrease .	IS1007c.D.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
1526.79	And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case .	IS1007c.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1678.79	But you can have an button for child lock .	IS1007c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1999.32	A and in the same lines we would have a one more problem .	IS1007c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2001.7	If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company .	IS1007c.D.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
2064.57	See you another thirty minutes .	IS1007c.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
326.69	Well if we're gonna dump the part of it into a database anyway , we might as well dump all the fields we want into the database , calculate everything from there .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	dump	[]	[]	[]
341.1	We can just query it .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	query	[]	[]	[]
393.66	Well if we're gonna do that , we should try and store everything in in an X.M.L. format as well .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
509.12	And we can just summarise based on that .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	summarise	[]	[]	[]
620.18	Like maybe weighted with the search terms , and then extract them .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	extract	[]	[]	[]
715.49	We'll have to buffer it .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
797.85	So it will make more sense , and if you get just extract words .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
872.5	But it'll need to be calculated at word level though because otherwise there won't be enough occurrences of the terms to make any meaningful sense .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
917.14	Maybe we should have like um a cut-off .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
982.5	And just build one in memory .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
989.44	But it must have like classes for dealing with files .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
992.97	And if it has classes for concatenating files , you can do it in memory .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1016.6	Well what I think I might try and build is basically a class that you just feed it a linked list of um different wave-forms , and it will just string them all together with maybe , I don't know , tenth of a second silence in between each one or something like that .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	string	[]	[]	[]
1041.16	Normalise it , yeah .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	Normalise	[]	[]	[]
1072.83	Oh yeah , yeah , we'll need that .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1076.21	We also really wanna be able to search by who's speaking as well .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1278.92	You just like create a new X.M.L. document in memory .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
1346.73	Like for summarisation , say we wanted a hundred utterances in the summary , just look at the meeting , take the top one hundred utterances in each other meeting .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1355.32	If it scores higher than the ones already in the summary so far , just replace them .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	replace	[]	[]	[]
1425.0	Speaker and um topic segmenting we'll need as well .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[Speaker]
1448.4	Well yeah , and then it'll f preserve the order when it's displayed the 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	preserve	[]	[]	[]
1557.56	So we should basically make our own X.M.L. document in memory 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
1571.62	And then have that X.M.L. uh NITE X.M.L. document tied to the interface .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[X.M.L., X.M.L.]
1579.86	Well , you can make it in a file if you want .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2051.06	Yeah , I mean we can process it in chunks if it gets too big basically .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	process	[]	[]	[]
2054.59	We can just process it all in chunks if it gets too big to load it into memory .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	process	[]	[]	[]
2104.99	And that will obviously make it much easier to display .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2144.53	Well , we can start off 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
2155.09	And then just I can change that to work on whatever .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
2505.0	So maybe we should try doing something really simple , like just displaying a whole meeting .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2905.84	So it's only gonna use quite small documents , you see , to start with .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
3115.47	Well all you really wanna do is look into getting some sub-set of the ICSI corpus off the DICE machines .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[ICSI, corpus, DICE]
3125.51	Like so I can use my home machine .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
3229.32	Put it on to C.D. .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[C.D.]
3230.99	I can if I get down I can put to C.D. .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[C.D.]
3444.21	So you could just um you could use just the same thing we used to build the big dictionary .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
3457.08	I mean just use the same tool that we use .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
3550.46	Which might need thinking about .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
3622.73	'Cause if we're looking at the whole lot of meetings , we'll consider each meeting a document in sort of terms of this algorithm .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
3746.73	Yeah , but you'd probably look at each meeting as a document .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
3832.1	Yeah , you just like whatever you want to look at , you just jam together into an X.M.L. file and that's your meeting , even though bits of it may come from all over the place or whatever .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
3906.1	I mean what you do is you just build an X.M.L. file , and if you want it to get down to the utterances , you'd go to the leaves .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
3913.38	And then if you wanted the next level up , you'd go to the parents of those and like just go from like the leaves inwards towards the branch to build up things like um you know , when you click on a segment , it's gonna have like words or whatever that are important .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
3966.04	Then when whatever your algorithm is doing , as long as when you're working with utterances , you go for all the leaves , like then if you need something next up , so like a topic segment , you'd go to here .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
3985.18	Right , so you it's same , you'd start with the leaves , and you go oh , I want a topic segment .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
3992.16	See , and then if you're working with just a topic segment in there , it's the only thing you have to worry about .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
4008.28	process any arbitrary X.M.L. 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	process	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
4058.02	So then you'd start with all your utterances here , and when you go up to get topic segments , you go to here here here here here here here .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
4183.21	Maybe you should send a support form .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
4191.06	Listen to .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	Listen	[]	[]	[]
4553.72	We can just change the code .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
4816.91	I could just use it with the frequency , I think , until the information density thing's finished .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
5013.02	Tonight I'll try and um I'll either work some more on uh the T.F.I.D.F. summarizer or do the audio thing .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[T.F.I.D.F.]
5115.46	Once we start doing it it will all become more or less obvious I think anyway .	EN2001a.D.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
104.21	Open .	IS1009b.C.words.xml	Open	[]	[]	[]
670.27	If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is .	IS1009b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
686.29	It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal , and the T.V. it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices .	IS1009b.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[T.V.]
736.53	So uh you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh T.V. or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T.V. can perform the actions .	IS1009b.C.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
932.99	So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so .	IS1009b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1008.93	And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's 	IS1009b.C.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
1050.3	Like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the T.V. is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light .	IS1009b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1074.56	Maybe we can have that .	IS1009b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1075.78	Whenever the T.V. is on , remote controller will have a light .	IS1009b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1120.17	Um uh can you move onto the next slide .	IS1009b.C.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
1757.67	We can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know .	IS1009b.C.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
1775.78	Yeah of course that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know .	IS1009b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
406.36	You should generalise .	EN2001d.A.words.xml	generalise	[]	[]	[]
835.77	So we should at least provide an overview of different meetings of one group .	EN2001d.A.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[]
1656.83	So I mean if you need me to work on something else , um I can try to finish my stuff um early , but um otherwise I can still keep working on it , improving it , I think .	EN2001d.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2433.49	Yeah , but do we really want do display them separately because the user won't okay , for now for our s okay .	EN2001d.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2448.14	Yeah , but then the user would have to know about what s w was what and what contributed to the blue stripes and what contributed to the red ones .	EN2001d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2613.31	Yeah , but we should all use the same programme , I think .	EN2001d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2617.34	Would prevent us from having too much mistakes in it .	EN2001d.A.words.xml	prevent	[]	[]	[]
2664.95	Yeah , I mean I can do it .	EN2001d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2665.94	I can read in the different um importance measures and then re re-calculate the numbers .	EN2001d.A.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
85.33	I wanna figure out how to sell them .	IS1009a.D.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
248.32	Maybe we should redesign it .	IS1009a.D.words.xml	redesign	[]	[]	[]
278.52	See if I r 	IS1009a.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
280.08	See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something .	IS1009a.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
290.06	So that it will record okay .	IS1009a.D.words.xml	record	[]	[]	[]
395.23	Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged .	IS1009a.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[Mm]
508.17	We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things .	IS1009a.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
538.53	Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help .	IS1009a.D.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
572.64	Uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink .	IS1009a.D.words.xml	blink	[]	[]	[]
639.09	So the light sensor would activate the signal .	IS1009a.D.words.xml	activate	[]	[]	[]
152.51	S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
162.74	You you can s here .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	s	[]	[]	[]
165.69	And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	browse	[]	[]	[joystick, like]
174.25	You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
352.68	Yeah just explain the button uh Norman .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[Norman]
436.55	Press one button uh acting as a a enter button .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	Press	[]	[]	[]
450.62	We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	produce	[]	[]	[]
478.65	so Norman will explain to you .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[Norman]
536.82	Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Norman]
593.56	that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1198.63	Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	give	[five , six]	[]	[]
1303.72	Talk about 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	Talk	[]	[]	[]
1390.56	Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so I will give a six for the easy to use .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1524.13	And to improve the the look .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	improve	[]	[]	[]
1532.8	Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1790.71	Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1925.06	Come up with new product .	IS1007d.C.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
255.26	And that should kinda take care of itself as well .	EN2003a.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
430.52	Well do we have um a d an idea of how many people were gonna 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
494.36	and then give it a twenty minute break perhaps .	EN2003a.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
694.65	And I should imagine that most people would rather do a poster than give a talk .	EN2003a.B.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
741.96	But um people kinda like generally sort of sort them out themsel that sort that out themselves .	EN2003a.B.words.xml	sort	[]	[]	[themsel]
762.54	I'd make it a whole morning or a whole afternoon .	EN2003a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
984.53	Um well we should find out if um generally they use poster boards , if there are some poster boards that we can get ahold of , then that's 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1172.56	And do you think inf Informatics would 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[inf, Informatics]
1224.87	Would we wanna ask them and put some kind of like provisor in to make it um specific to sort of preemptively 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1234.39	um weed out the numbers or should we just say to them oh , you know , we're having this thing about language and , you know , if you got something you think about language , come to 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	weed	[]	[]	[]
1359.57	I'll do that .	EN2003a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1385.73	No one will understand .	EN2003a.B.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
1943.89	Say get back with the title by the seventh .	EN2003a.B.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
1945.95	Or do we need ten days to go from 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	need	[ten days]	[]	[]
2201.62	'Cause I'll just tell 'em a modified version of that .	EN2003a.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
2205.06	But I'll try and get a good address to send it to .	EN2003a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
239.52	So I I would need separate files for each segment or just maybe have delimiters inbetween each segment .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
248.4	Okay , yeah , and y then I can make files of that .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
395.39	Yeah , I would just end up with uh values for each word , so I wouldn't have um 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	end	[]	[]	[]
407.13	I just I just would have the words , and then how we um how long each expression would be , I don't know .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
456.06	So then we would have to fit in more than just one where values um 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
680.63	So we n would need a value label for each of those segments that are not dialogue acts .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1147.59	So so they have they have their utterances displayed in their interface .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1344.07	Yeah , I I could use another a different approach , though .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1403.49	Um would you think it would make sense to just take um file files by speaker .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1416.87	So I just could g use the files as they are .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1567.31	And if you get a new document , it will um compare which words are in that new document .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	compare	[]	[]	[]
1576.03	And if there are a lot of words that um are typical for one category , it will assign it to that category , and if it's typical for another one , it will assign it to that one .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	assign	[]	[]	[]
1623.36	No , I've just um split them up uh somehow um by um there are several documents for 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	split	[]	[]	[]
1891.06	And in my case it would have I think it would have different uh values for each category .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1898.62	But in that category it would have the same value at each place .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1927.72	Um that would be best , but I I would have to look if that .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2182.67	Yeah , but it I think it should work for just one document , because it it compares between the categories , and if you just have one document um it still can find out which words are informative for that category and which are not .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2212.98	So it should work for one , but I'm not sure if how exactly it it um calculates everything .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
2378.57	Yeah , maybe I should try something different and just programme it for myself .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2849.37	We could even yeah , we could even have a look at our different measures , if they um 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2857.59	come up with the same same kinds of yeah .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
3228.6	Because you could take that on ours out maybe .	EN2001b.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
977.19	Can you reach , that would be great , thank you .	ES2009d.D.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
1022.59	Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense .	ES2009d.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1248.42	And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be .	ES2009d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1262.85	And highly resourceful team mates might I add which is always a plus .	ES2009d.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1330.05	Do your own .	ES2009d.D.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
1348.42	So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped .	ES2009d.D.words.xml	fill	[]	[]	[]
1412.6	That's kind of a good thing though , you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey .	ES2009d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1448.46	I could only imagine .	ES2009d.D.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1743.76	My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe and they were just empty .	ES2009d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1960.64	Make it sound eloquent .	ES2009d.D.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1989.59	Just add some prefixes , sounds classier .	ES2009d.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
297.33	Okay , I can start first .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
337.56	Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
356.89	This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
395.8	Then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
410.4	Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
498.52	So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice 	IS1009c.B.words.xml	record	[]	[]	[]
510.39	which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , for example , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , uh th now the the uh yeah , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
528.11	So the T.V. will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
568.61	So you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
573.6	Even a kid can use that .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
575.96	So can you go on t t uh to the next slide .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1224.56	Transmit .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	Transmit	[]	[]	[]
1591.21	No , it's it's , uh yeah , it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th For example , you have a T.V. system , I'm the user and my family members are the user , I will already record uh a question like , uh good morning , like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	record	[]	[]	[th, T.V.]
1617.56	It will recognise my voice and will switch on .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	recognise	[]	[]	[]
1689.78	Supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button .	IS1009c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
86.03	Bless you .	ES2011c.D.words.xml	Bless	[]	[]	[]
378.84	And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer .	ES2011c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
581.69	But the screen can come up on the telly , the she said .	ES2011c.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
601.45	Uh on the you can have it on the telly though .	ES2011c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
779.53	On the you can just take theirs and just 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1004.64	But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , and I never get it .	ES2011c.D.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1075.4	Just nice feel , but I hate spongy .	ES2011c.D.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
1137.19	And it could the colour can fit your sitting room , so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have well I don't know .	ES2011c.D.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1205.7	That you can p well I see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit and I'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put a um 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	p	[]	[]	[]
1293.2	But well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that , and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that , and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is , and 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	contact	[]	[]	[]
1333.99	If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1378.57	Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
91.64	Check .	TS3004a.D.words.xml	Check	[]	[]	[]
391.54	Let me try one .	TS3004a.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
407.74	How do I do 	TS3004a.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
416.42	I'll take this one .	TS3004a.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
433.99	So I first uh draw the water .	TS3004a.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
889.89	I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality .	TS3004a.D.words.xml	act	[]	[]	[]
1082.0	You can yeah , you can buy it with it .	TS3004a.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1128.1	You can make it very special , to create our own um looks , but it's very hard to 	TS3004a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1242.56	Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the 	TS3004a.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert]
171.3	Yeah , and yeah , most th th they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it , and um they use yeah , they use zap a lot , um uh fifty percent say they only 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[zap]
253.44	Uh um um beep to find your control , was that was in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control , so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it .	TS3012b.D.words.xml	beep	[]	[]	[]
311.41	Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , so I can uh I dunno , so I can zap to my uh 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	zap	[]	[]	[]
322.67	f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what I uh so , the remote mu must see or um 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	wh	[]	[]	[]
333.21	must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , so I can zap t to 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	zap	[]	[]	[]
349.6	Recognise 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	Recognise	[]	[]	[]
1863.96	here is my marketing report , maybe you ca you can look at uh that and 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1883.48	And uh wha what people want , 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[]
2050.47	We can look at the possibilities for an uh L.C.D. and uh I dunno .	TS3012b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
2057.57	How much it will cost and 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[]
2070.99	It will come uh 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
2180.07	But i if you if you are going to uh put the L.C.D. on it , I think it's very important to use it , uh because it's use it uh 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
2194.23	So you can use it maximum , because uh it's a lot it costs a lot .	TS3012b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2226.24	you must use the maximum of it .	TS3012b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
900.7	Uh the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T.V. .	ES2003b.D.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[dig, digital, signal, T.V.]
918.67	Do we need uh many buttons , or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not .	ES2003b.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
995.08	You have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , uh will contact the T.V. and will have whatever device or D.V.D. player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on .	ES2003b.D.words.xml	contact	[]	[]	[bulb, T.V.]
1822.04	Yeah , think so .	ES2003b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1854.14	To flash .	ES2003b.D.words.xml	flash	[]	[]	[]
1975.74	So I should just look at um the speaker , the speaker and an L.E.D. .	ES2003b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[L.E.D.]
360.85	Use it .	IS1003a.B.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
362.74	Make make yeah .	IS1003a.B.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
490.16	Try first .	IS1003a.B.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
501.0	You can draw something which is very simple .	IS1003a.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
507.99	Oh , maybe we should bring Kemy here .	IS1003a.B.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[Kemy]
418.3	Oh , to go first .	ES2015a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
553.25	Okay , I'll go next .	ES2015a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
632.96	I'll rub that out .	ES2015a.B.words.xml	rub	[]	[]	[]
688.35	We can pretend .	ES2015a.B.words.xml	pretend	[]	[]	[]
963.68	So maybe if you could have some kind of 	ES2015a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
974.59	You can press a button on your wall , signal , 'cause it always gets lost .	ES2015a.B.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[signal]
1052.32	I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing .	ES2015a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1060.25	Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either .	ES2015a.B.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
76.68	So um if you want , I'll just give a brief overview of what's happening and then we can uh talk about , well , arranging these new uh the new office space .	IB4003.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
201.57	So each person should get um , well , it's a sort of desk , it's made of two pieces and it looks like a corner .	IB4003.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
210.15	Uh a filing cabinet that goes under the desk uh and , well , we can put hanging shelves over the the desks .	IB4003.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
225.94	But um we could try .	IB4003.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
239.45	Um , I can keep this for you .	IB4003.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
261.15	Normally we should even get an extra uh an extra place for , you know , temporary people coming to work on uh on projects .	IB4003.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
355.26	Maybe we can think of , yeah , some two or three , yeah , for visiting people .	IB4003.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
409.32	So the idea is that today we'll just try to f start seeing the main constraints and then you have time to to go and think about it uh ask the people you know , your assistants , for instance , and at the next meeting we'll try to to come with one solution .	IB4003.A.words.xml	try	[today]	[]	[]
427.99	Uh , the other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation .	IB4003.A.words.xml	propose	[]	[]	[]
468.3	Um okay , so maybe we could try to to see now what would be the main options .	IB4003.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
476.79	Say the general uh , well , arrangement options .	IB4003.A.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
584.51	I I think that's Yeah , there is no real competition between the two , but we'll just try to find at least two solutions and see how how close they are , actually .	IB4003.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
593.75	It's it's I think well the m the people who who decided this thought it was the best solution to , mm well , you know , find two two kinds of opinions .	IB4003.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
681.89	Um so since all of you have a copy of the uh , well , of the drawing , I think for the next time , m maybe you could come with a concrete proposal with uh names on it .	IB4003.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
711.79	Would you prefer to be alone , would you prefer to be with your assistant .	IB4003.A.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
929.98	Yeah , I I I will try to find out whether we can separate .	IB4003.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
941.05	So it's quite a lot of uh of work , but uh I will try to find this out for the next time .	IB4003.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
957.68	So at least some of the professors , since you are four , uh could could go uh well , could take these uh these rooms .	IB4003.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1041.51	Um , maybe we could s look a bit at the projects .	IB4003.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1063.28	Well , yeah , and some of the P.H.D. students will hopefully finish their P.H.D. at some point .	IB4003.A.words.xml	finish	[]	[]	[P.H.D.]
1105.59	Well , actually , so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room , but there are also more formal meeting rooms available in in the building , as we now know .	IB4003.A.words.xml	serve	[]	[]	[]
1199.22	And you're you're working Uh I think , yeah , w Okay , so one of the things I have to do for the next time is fin find out about the separations between rooms and 	IB4003.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1223.1	And okay , I'll try to find out .	IB4003.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1506.6	Okay , we'll try , but all these , yeah , are say sort of difficult questions because they involve changing also the offices of the school and , you know , people just don't wanna change in general .	IB4003.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1517.42	Um , let's see , maybe we can find some temporary well , at least a proposal for Gisella .	IB4003.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1610.76	Yeah , because in this case , yeah , Gisella could take one of the the two person rooms and the other place would be for some kind of visitor , that 	IB4003.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1650.08	Uh yeah we'll try to to find out .	IB4003.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1652.92	Um , actually , yeah , maybe we should remind that quite a lot of professors at the at the school actually share their office with their assistant .	IB4003.A.words.xml	remind	[]	[]	[]
1707.85	Maybe try to , well , think on your own and then talk a little bit just to the people around you .	IB4003.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1734.26	No the point was to try to , well , just talk to them , to David , or 	IB4003.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[David]
1812.79	Okay , th then Okay then for the next time , um try to come up either with your own preferences , that's quite easy probably to state now that you know the constraints , or if you can poll a little bit the people around you , that would be I mean , even 	IB4003.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1830.12	Well , just discuss i Yeah , for instance , I mean No , no , I was thinking just ask people around you what they think about this .	IB4003.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1841.01	If you can do slides , it's even better , but uh don't be that formal .	IB4003.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1844.94	And uh we'll try to at least build up one coherent proposal , and we'll merge it with the other one when the other one uh is available .	IB4003.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1870.18	And I'll try to 	IB4003.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1885.03	Yeah , w we can bring your coffee in the reading room , but 	IB4003.A.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1900.55	And we can bring our coffee .	IB4003.A.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1934.6	Come on , try try to be nice .	IB4003.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
1938.5	Gi give me a reasonable date .	IB4003.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[Gi]
275.82	We should make a big sponge lemon , and then it'd be it would be yellow .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
934.11	and I'll I'll give you the uh , I guess , technical considerations for those .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
953.81	So , the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , and then we'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	reuse	[]	[]	[]
986.0	Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , um and there's a a chip , a processor , the T.A. one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , and ch 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	ch	[]	[]	[T.A.]
1060.31	So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1099.15	Uh or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	sponge	[]	[]	[]
1211.51	Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Mm]
1249.56	We could have a little L.E.D.s on each end .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1294.71	See 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1296.55	So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1315.87	So it'd look like this kinda .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1372.23	Okay , we could do that .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1412.95	Okay uh I could put the microphone here .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1535.63	They can work from a You don't have to hold it .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1543.42	I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , you know they have uh fruits all round them .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	encourage	[]	[]	[]
1585.15	It can sit at a distance and pick it up still .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[]
1733.56	So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , and the colours we got down , and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1833.27	We can use a hand-dynamo .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1842.11	Right , it's like those watches that you c So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	shake	[]	[]	[wanna, grab]
2034.74	Try uh flipping the screen down .	ES2005c.A.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
11.68	Je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	croix	[]	[]	[Je]
61.09	So we will uh I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[]
70.52	uh I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
78.9	We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
98.76	Then we will uh evaluate the product .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
102.74	And uh end 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	end	[]	[]	[]
116.44	So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy , 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
159.89	So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if , and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	continue	[]	[]	[]
268.41	Maybe you can presen okay .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	presen	[]	[]	[]
272.32	Maybe hold it .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
288.61	I will give a six .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
349.64	Well , we can choose what we want .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
357.69	So so do note the grade we have five , six for me , five .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	note	[five , six]	[]	[]
469.36	I would give a I would give a seven as well .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
552.66	So maybe we can put a six .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
641.88	So , I think , we can summarise .	IS1001d.A.words.xml	summarise	[]	[]	[]
139.59	Format save .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[Format]
418.47	And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
539.72	find yours .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
551.51	Go Jurgen .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[Jurgen]
565.28	Uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
668.7	Yeah so maybe you can hide them or something .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	hide	[]	[]	[]
779.71	Uh kick off .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	kick	[]	[]	[]
911.69	Work harder .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	Work	[]	[]	[]
975.06	Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1150.95	Do the also with the thumb .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
1153.27	So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
1160.3	Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	screen	[]	[]	[]
1431.45	Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	Channel	[]	[]	[]
1436.15	So maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L.C.D. screen .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
1557.4	Contrast yeah .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	Contrast	[]	[]	[]
1597.45	Yeah you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1669.2	Uh name a channel , or 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	name	[]	[]	[]
1840.86	The User Interface Designer can design a menu 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer]
1857.15	I'll just try to reorganise uh things .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2029.83	Put it on top .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
2098.13	You can navigate .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	navigate	[]	[]	[]
2101.74	But you can also navigate the channels .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	navigate	[]	[]	[]
2180.17	Yeah okay go ahead .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2331.5	Make me proud .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
2341.01	just ask .	TS3006b.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
38.69	We'll open that when the time is right .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
59.52	Let's see what this thing does .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
112.76	Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[Sarah]
201.36	'Cause this way I can more easily flip it .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	flip	[]	[]	[]
242.29	Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[kinetic, energy]
256.27	Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
260.95	Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling 	ES2013d.A.words.xml	excuse	[]	[]	[]
306.4	Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
660.45	And then you can use your thumb .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
788.13	Try again .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
944.33	Come on .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
1429.49	Oh shoot , forget that .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	shoot	[]	[]	[]
1443.94	Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1529.36	We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1598.99	'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1683.81	Yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide .	ES2013d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
235.99	We can put it .	IB4001.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
598.2	You can u mm-hmm .	IB4001.C.words.xml	u	[]	[]	[]
950.74	Do so Yeah .	IB4001.C.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
1419.01	But we can uh reserve So if you reserve a two people room , we can put uh trainees 	IB4001.C.words.xml	reserve	[]	[]	[]
4.8	So , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy .	ES2005a.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
143.92	Sorry , carry on .	ES2005a.C.words.xml	carry	[]	[]	[]
162.73	For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty .	ES2005a.C.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[Euros]
170.44	Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
180.51	uh , oh actually , no , we'll allocate .	ES2005a.C.words.xml	allocate	[]	[]	[]
187.44	Um , if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into um 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
210.53	And obviously , other instructions will come from the personal coach .	ES2005a.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
215.63	Which will probably just usurp what I said so 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	usurp	[]	[]	[]
219.33	Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive .	ES2005a.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
281.9	And no doubt we'll get um 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
286.02	We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well .	ES2005a.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
63.89	Come on .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
175.42	No , just tell us .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
343.98	Well , I'll I'll get back on it .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
505.21	Yeah , I'll get back on that .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
533.57	I'll check what they exact mean .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
627.78	I'll I'll give you my design .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
650.29	to make a sort of a design .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
732.24	They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
783.0	Do we want to use 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
786.37	Well then we can even simplify it more .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	simplify	[]	[]	[]
871.71	I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	light	[]	[]	[]
888.52	So we can uh switch these to I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	switch	[the bottom half]	[]	[]
918.32	And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I don't think we should put it on top then .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	rec	[]	[]	[]
935.52	To use 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1128.87	You can Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1134.28	So you can just replace them I think .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	replace	[]	[]	[]
1137.24	That was the idea , or just uh release one .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	release	[]	[]	[]
1142.77	Yeah , uh Or just uh sell different ones .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
1250.75	Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh Yeah .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1296.18	And I can change the colour of it .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1746.37	Use the dz 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
1833.3	Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1904.95	Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
2088.4	But uh I had a lot of pictures Oh I can show you here 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
2134.75	If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[iPod]
2145.13	And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2153.54	Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2260.87	Think the scroll wheel won't be very big .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
2289.98	Well , maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
2358.34	So we can put all the 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2393.03	This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question .	TS3004c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
0.04	That should hopefully do the trick , um .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
35.05	So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
79.42	So um due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first , and uh show us the prototype .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
181.79	We'll go into that a bit more , but please go on .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
524.09	um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
544.89	And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
607.58	No and which we will do very very shortly .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
639.25	Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L.C.D. , at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , require more buttons , etcetera .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	require	[]	[]	[]
660.52	Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in , we've got point two of a Euro left over there .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	allow	[]	[]	[Euro]
717.52	We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
725.19	We can I can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
777.63	Let's have a look .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
799.01	We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
816.92	if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[Euro]
823.06	That might make sense , because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what , four point five Euros , which is an awful lot , so that could well be wrong .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
831.84	Even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
922.7	We might have to 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1001.46	If we remove the L.C. display , we could save ourselves 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	save	[]	[L.C.]	[]
1028.09	We should possibly have 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1050.59	Again , you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1184.21	Um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1268.9	So we'll leave that one for now .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
1270.8	we'll just have 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1353.81	Just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , I'm not sure how much time .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1559.23	It would also help keep the the product placement s yeah .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
1726.84	Um right okay it's considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1834.64	Hide it in the fruit basket .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	Hide	[]	[]	[]
1923.78	Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	pop	[]	[]	[]
1940.05	Does anybody want to um 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1946.45	For example um we'll work backwards I suppose .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1996.08	It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	seem	[]	[]	[]
2058.55	Um I would have to agree on that .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2064.1	If you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector , then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	afford	[]	[]	[]
2072.67	Because they will pay outrageous cash to 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	pay	[]	[]	[]
2152.21	Probably would have mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end , I would have to agree .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
2234.89	But we'll go into that later .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2289.79	So um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such .	ES2003d.B.words.xml	round	[]	[]	[]
763.03	Yeah , press them .	ES2013b.C.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
800.94	Uh well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah .	ES2013b.C.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[Sarah]
833.92	If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss .	ES2013b.C.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
872.23	It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies .	ES2013b.C.words.xml	stop	[]	[]	[]
894.23	Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all .	ES2013b.C.words.xml	stop	[]	[]	[]
967.25	Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
982.48	But we could go back to the pictures of the 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
993.27	and possibly discuss what we think about them , but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first .	ES2013b.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[Kate]
1481.17	With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever .	ES2013b.C.words.xml	jus	[]	[]	[]
1483.98	You could you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A.A. batteries , which are 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	know	[ages and ages and ages]	[A.A.]	[]
1542.41	No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A.A. batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer and 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	cost	[]	[A.A.]	[]
1875.94	do them on the actual television itself , like here you have a 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2114.29	From their I'll just use it from their website .	ES2013b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
200.12	Otherwise , could you just describe 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	describe	[]	[]	[]
966.62	But basically yeah maybe I can continue with my presentation , it would be al you you but I think we have some technical problem or so .	IS1001b.C.words.xml	continue	[]	[]	[al]
984.06	Do I have oh yeah .	IS1001b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1014.23	Let's say that 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1033.17	Push button or a L.C.D. .	IS1001b.C.words.xml	Push	[]	[]	[]
1326.81	To to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that .	IS1001b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1694.71	I know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now , you have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back .	IS1001b.C.words.xml	som	[]	[]	[]
1742.8	Let's say that we can do something like that .	IS1001b.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1754.33	To go fa to go faster .	IS1001b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1841.41	Or we can do something like that .	IS1001b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1843.18	We can design the remote control to have access .	IS1001b.C.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
223.51	If you have anything to add , please interrupt me .	TS3012d.B.words.xml	interrupt	[]	[]	[]
354.65	Well , I'd I tend to disagree with you on that , because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this .	TS3012d.B.words.xml	tend	[]	[]	[]
420.94	We could take out a curve indeed .	TS3012d.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
507.56	Which we can fabricate , okay .	TS3012d.B.words.xml	fabricate	[]	[]	[]
675.24	So we could u still have the comfort .	TS3012d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
700.25	No , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control .	TS3012d.B.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
738.71	So we can always do that .	TS3012d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
783.51	Yes , we could have 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
935.57	To make it that way , yeah .	TS3012d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1215.04	Maybe we should go with a two then , because it's not perfect , because we can't do it initially , but we 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1492.84	And we could share information which we received .	TS3012d.B.words.xml	share	[]	[]	[]
1539.95	further elaborate on that .	TS3012d.B.words.xml	elaborate	[]	[]	[]
1863.68	You should write it down as a an option .	TS3012d.B.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1906.02	Should I write the banana down or 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1925.51	Uh do you mean it like 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
118.36	So if we make the computing um functionalities disappearing on on the in the furniture , in the wall or other things like that , we may more efficiently support uh collaboration than the the learning .	IN1008.C.words.xml	support	[]	[]	[]
175.31	The idea is if we can provide a feedback to people working together , uh it may help them self-regulating their activity , their collaboration .	IN1008.C.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
213.4	So if we have this table uh that is accesi accessible to students if they arrive , if we provide a feedback of um who is talking , um instantly the uh at one moment or uh through time or the turn taking , uh maybe they will just by seeing an explicit uh feedback of that , they will um take profit uh of it and um 	IN1008.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
283.05	But we will uh have LEDs that will be distant .	IN1008.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
290.69	The idea is to have more um a kind of uh art , artistic uh feedback , to have a kind of general feeling of what's going on .	IN1008.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
390.46	And we will have uh a square shape like this that will be here and a second one that would be there .	IN1008.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
396.64	So we will have something like this .	IN1008.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
411.77	We should have them in a couple of weeks .	IN1008.C.words.xml	have	[a couple of weeks]	[]	[]
422.78	Uh uh about the C.S.C.W. class , that will start at the end at the beginning of November .	IN1008.C.words.xml	start	[the beginning of November]	[]	[C.S.C.W.]
435.41	So to find the shape uh of the table to get uh who the and put that uh on the um on table uh legs .	IN1008.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
461.06	Um so we will rather beam uh the L.E.D. on the table .	IN1008.C.words.xml	beam	[]	[]	[L.E.D.]
468.92	B but we will um restrict it to a small uh to have the same display .	IN1008.C.words.xml	restrict	[]	[]	[]
481.6	So we will simulate our 	IN1008.C.words.xml	simulate	[]	[]	[]
505.37	And we have the feeling that to have the information embedded in the table , make it part of the table , it I don't know , we'll we we will try uh we don't really know what uh will happen with this prototype .	IN1008.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
523.64	Okay , uh maybe before uh going on on this subject we can talk talk a little bit on uh 	IN1008.C.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
644.48	So uh maybe we can focus a little uh uh bit more on the what we have done about uh the noise sensitive table .	IN1008.C.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
652.48	Tell you about uh what we're interested in on the so we start so Guillaume started by uh developing the application that get the audio input .	IN1008.C.words.xml	Tell	[]	[]	[Guillaume]
768.05	W we will uh we are thinking about the visual grammar , meaning that when we have an interaction event that is uh fired , we uh will associate uh a way of visuali visualising it .	IN1008.C.words.xml	associate	[]	[]	[]
782.8	So for instance if someone is talking , uh we can just have a light that will centre on the point that is uh close to him .	IN1008.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
813.26	And then if there's turn taking , we can show waves of light going from uh me to you uh or from other people .	IN1008.C.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
861.82	In uh we can change inte so we have uh eight by eight uh two times LEDs .	IN1008.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
873.78	And we can change the intensity .	IN1008.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
971.33	Maybe we could summarise the question we were thinking about .	IN1008.C.words.xml	summarise	[]	[]	[]
1086.54	Um I would just add something .	IN1008.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1113.33	Go on .	IN1008.C.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1126.5	And I would add uh one more .	IN1008.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1153.39	How to detect that it's the same people .	IN1008.C.words.xml	detect	[]	[]	[]
1176.54	So we can infer that if a sound is coming in this area , it's the same .	IN1008.C.words.xml	infer	[]	[]	[]
1292.66	So in a couple of days we will get this um uh the fire-wire uh box .	IN1008.C.words.xml	get	[a couple of days]	[]	[box]
1356.49	To have eight more X.L.R. if we need it .	IN1008.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1361.7	But we can extend it .	IN1008.C.words.xml	extend	[]	[]	[]
1399.49	And secondly , maybe we will use this box , you know , to get uh data .	IN1008.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1695.85	So maybe w uh you could present a different work uh you have done .	IN1008.C.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[]
2514.41	And can you detect if someone is laughing or angry d uh there is kind of signature uh even if we can't really trust it uh uh s one hundred percent of the time .	IN1008.C.words.xml	detect	[]	[]	[]
528.91	Um I would think would be more like sixty percent .	ES2013a.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
663.13	We could make a Hello Kitty 	ES2013a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Kitty]
671.69	We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation .	ES2013a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[Japan]	[]
706.45	Well , that's a really good point , because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , you know , so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume .	ES2013a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
731.86	We can make it smart like an iPod , you know , make everything menus .	ES2013a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[iPod]
478.79	Need an advanced chip for the L.C.D. .	ES2003c.C.words.xml	Need	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1109.36	So uh to gather my research , two basic methods .	ES2003c.C.words.xml	gather	[]	[]	[]
1137.52	As in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , but they don't care so much , you know .	ES2003c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1178.22	I is it has to be cooler than easy to use , you know , if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features .	ES2003c.C.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
1265.16	Um I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , so maybe it is important for it's the up to the interface guy .	ES2003c.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1271.93	So if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit .	ES2003c.C.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
1311.98	So um if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it doesn't matter , it's spongy material , it's not gonna break , you know .	ES2003c.C.words.xml	stress	[]	[]	[]
1344.35	So just to summarise , people want stuff that's cool , that's that looks like it's cool , and if it is cool then that's a bonus doesn't have to be um people like fruit and veg .	ES2003c.C.words.xml	summarise	[]	[]	[]
1356.16	We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it .	ES2003c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1361.15	If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea .	ES2003c.C.words.xml	promote	[]	[]	[]
1453.94	You can incorporate names into the menu .	ES2003c.C.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
1643.34	But why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature , I I don't know .	ES2003c.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2134.17	It would make sense if you could 	ES2003c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
16.64	No , just uh ask if if he could manage .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
194.15	Let's see where my 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
276.92	Think 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
329.76	Uh we can make a model that has one curve , two or three .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
504.11	Okay , and if we use rubber , I already mentioned that , we can only use rubber buttons .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
507.62	So rubber can only match with rubber .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	match	[]	[]	[]
554.22	We can do that .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
555.29	Think .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
567.04	So they might find that attractive in a remote con 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
574.62	So push-buttons we will use .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1367.06	So I can uh qui oh .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	qui	[]	[]	[]
1368.96	I can quickly make a conclusion 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1667.67	I would prefer round .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
1871.6	I would curve the whole actually .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	curve	[]	[]	[]
1875.14	I would curve the whole .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	curve	[]	[]	[]
1883.7	Then it will bounce and you don't drop it so easily .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	bounce	[]	[]	[]
1915.06	Let's make it yellow then .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1939.16	Maybe once we can make a special edition in according with Chiquita .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Chiquita]
1955.43	They might wanna be the first ones to uh 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1962.38	Oh , perhaps they can use it .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1964.84	Or give a special edition uh with with 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1988.16	You can actually uh place a chip for the L.C.D. screen and at the bottom , and and wire it .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	place	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
2075.94	Like uh g uh give confirmation or something .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2119.65	So beep .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	beep	[]	[]	[]
2199.18	I would change .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
2200.02	I would take a yellow remote control .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2202.2	To have it flashy , to have it it's for young people .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2282.66	No , forget it .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	forget	[]	[]	[]
2307.86	Let's vote on it .	TS3012c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
782.36	So you might as well remember the number .	TS3004b.C.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
827.0	But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel .	TS3004b.C.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
1223.25	And uh transmit that uh to the T.V. .	TS3004b.C.words.xml	transmit	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1312.45	Just to indicate it's working .	TS3004b.C.words.xml	indicate	[]	[]	[]
1317.72	So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal .	TS3004b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1453.69	And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so And then he saves that setting and then um it's working .	TS3004b.C.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
1548.47	Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah .	TS3004b.C.words.xml	presu	[]	[]	[]
1658.13	We'll have enough power to 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1772.33	No , and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use .	TS3004b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[teletext]
1915.69	And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[English, Dutch]
1942.62	And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing or 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1972.48	Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
159.62	You could change the vegetable , or fruit .	ES2011d.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
194.61	It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big .	ES2011d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
243.24	You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango .	ES2011d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1110.72	And like then it you could hold it in your hand better .	ES2011d.C.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
1159.02	Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection , like you could probably do a strawberry still .	ES2011d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1167.51	You could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like sorta like a joystick .	ES2011d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1213.39	That could work .	ES2011d.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1285.89	Like uh we could do I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .	ES2011d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[sha]
1397.71	So we'll have to like 	ES2011d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1407.81	You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like , but you could do like 	ES2011d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1694.7	Yeah I kinda thought that um I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated because I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time .	ES2011d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
241.33	Because you can decide what compression factor and everything .	IN1007.D.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
688.8	Then we can talk more about .	IN1007.D.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
924.31	So um just they in th um in the speech uh re-synthesis or coding , what you're doing , um did you try to to play with the knobs somewhere .	IN1007.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1515.13	Go on .	IN1007.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1725.66	D no one could ever m move the mouse 	IN1007.D.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
1813.12	Normally it would take hour and a half .	IN1007.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1914.59	So we will send you the papers related .	IN1007.D.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1918.29	And I will point you to all the code which I have .	IN1007.D.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
1928.52	Yeah , I can play it back .	IN1007.D.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1931.52	So I can just now tell the the locations of all the files and you can rewind .	IN1007.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
2080.58	Note note yeah , all the notepads and everything , all the notes from any courses .	IN1007.D.words.xml	Note	[]	[]	[]
2100.71	Uh uh I would add 	IN1007.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
2216.68	And I would have to stay one more .	IN1007.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2363.35	Uh ask Hynek .	IN1007.D.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[Hynek]
2365.67	Ask my boss .	IN1007.D.words.xml	Ask	[]	[]	[]
148.95	Okay , just hang on a second everybody .	ES2007a.A.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[]
213.67	Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal .	ES2007a.A.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
240.72	Or put 'em in your pocket , yeah .	ES2007a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
405.03	Um yeah , I think you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks .	ES2007a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
575.09	Let's move on to the next page .	ES2007a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
608.02	experience with with remote control , so talk about who who's used what .	ES2007a.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
754.47	but that would p that would probably be quite expensive .	ES2007a.A.words.xml	p	[]	[]	[]
773.8	Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not .	ES2007a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
942.6	We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a T.V. , but it's just a really good , nice one .	ES2007a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
956.3	See 'cause , I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make .	ES2007a.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1100.59	Let's move on .	ES2007a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
341.67	Oh it should okay , yeah .	IS1003b.A.words.xml	okay	[]	[]	[]
343.03	The user should know .	IS1003b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
799.08	We've made a study , so could you go to next slide .	IS1003b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
846.68	Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um 	IS1003b.A.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
880.64	So we should change this as well .	IS1003b.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
902.11	But I'll come back to it later .	IS1003b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
967.23	If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay .	IS1003b.A.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
974.65	And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , this would definitely be a good way of selling more .	IS1003b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1029.58	Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the 	IS1003b.A.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
1160.7	Yeah , remember it's twelve Euros .	IS1003b.A.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[Euros]
60.08	Alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	welcome	[]	[]	[]
95.49	So , um , take it away Poppy .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[Poppy]
408.87	Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
416.72	You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
440.92	We'll still have to investigate the financial implications .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
450.53	Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
478.71	So those are what , um , we'll c construct the remote .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	construct	[]	[]	[]
949.79	I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
991.09	And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , because I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1259.26	Um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1290.39	Wonder if it would have 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	Wonder	[]	[]	[]
1322.66	Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	negate	[]	[]	[]
1520.83	Um , for one thing , because Having controls with D.V.D. , V.C.R. , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	complicate	[]	[]	[D.V.D., V.C.R.]
1630.18	So , um , all the remote controls must have our um We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1654.42	we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1693.85	and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1711.27	But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[Genevieve]
1837.35	Yeah , it would have t 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1865.3	That's your department you'll have to sort that out .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1967.51	Could we somehow We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
2066.67	Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2230.71	You'd just get one mould , 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2233.35	throw some plastic in it , you know .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
2247.57	So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2256.76	We'll have to do more research .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2258.67	Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2287.05	Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later .	ES2015b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
175.38	I only v have three slides , so .	IS1001c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
217.02	And um yeah we can change directly .	IS1001c.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
285.08	We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money .	IS1001c.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
358.08	wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , and if we could reduce that .	IS1001c.B.words.xml	reduce	[]	[]	[]
1179.86	Wheel on the top .	IS1001c.B.words.xml	Wheel	[]	[]	[]
57.2	Just just carry on .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	carry	[]	[]	[]
705.52	Yeah , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
944.39	Um we can have your bog standard double double A. batteries in a replaceable um little compartment .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
952.15	We can have a hand sorry a wind-up , yeah , which I think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control , but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1017.29	I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1036.47	Um well push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
1040.38	Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1054.28	select something .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
1055.88	Um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it's it the technology is there .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1064.07	And we can also incorporate an L.C.D. display in the remote , but this will increase the cost .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1082.74	If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
1090.74	Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	pay	[]	[]	[]
1129.2	We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1138.79	Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , but um 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1155.2	Um but it could have an L.C.D. screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1247.14	We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , which would allow um say a banana , but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , we can't do anything fancier .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1332.58	I think it yeah , you you will do an 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1560.77	Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	support	[]	[]	[]
1754.21	But we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	implement	[]	[]	[]
1826.17	We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2050.21	And and how much you do have to keep it moving , 'cause I'm conscious that watching T.V. can be quite a sed sedentary activity .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
2186.83	I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but I agree , it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is .	ES2013c.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2201.38	I should I should r 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	r	[]	[]	[]
74.69	Move to the meeting room .	TS3006a.B.words.xml	Move	[]	[]	[]
320.92	Okay I'll will give it an uh an eye .	TS3006a.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
325.46	Come on .	TS3006a.B.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
918.95	It has to be uh yeah , you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house .	TS3006a.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1086.42	I would first m 	TS3006a.B.words.xml	m	[]	[]	[]
1188.57	Can we leave now or 	TS3006a.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
119.08	Uh , me again , Rajan the Marketing Expert .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	Rajan	[]	[]	[Rajan, Marketing, Expert]
202.08	Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
219.52	And yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[wi]
239.0	So even if the available market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	seem	[]	[]	[Euros]
271.92	And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	emphasise	[]	[]	[]
313.84	So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	reduce	[]	[]	[]
330.39	Uh , escape , okay thank you .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	escape	[]	[]	[]
348.84	Ah t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[consu]
360.28	Yeah , these are different age group persons like uh sorry , I can open it in another way .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
371.74	If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	find	[thirty five years]	[]	[]
391.48	So we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh T.V. are belong to this age group .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	emphasise	[]	[]	[ag, T.V.]
408.44	So we should look 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
412.63	We can look at that that factor also , so yes .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
561.04	Escape .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	Escape	[]	[]	[]
1544.34	But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
1560.05	Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales , so we should take it into consideration also .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
2012.07	Glow in dark .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	Glow	[]	[]	[]
2284.75	Check here .	ES2005b.B.words.xml	Check	[]	[]	[]
107.99	So what do you think for uh 	IB4002.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
792.58	Yeah , we can skive .	IB4002.B.words.xml	skive	[]	[]	[]
1098.48	Well , you can you als already speak quite well Finnish , so we might get along , yeah .	IB4002.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1121.8	find the people .	IB4002.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1441.35	We can skive as you said .	IB4002.B.words.xml	skive	[]	[]	[]
1649.24	Let's see what the the other ones say .	IB4002.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1725.05	Of course , you can mail em yeah , if you have something .	IB4002.B.words.xml	mail	[]	[]	[]
157.73	So you can show your prototype if you want to .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
270.32	So you can put it on the back as well if you want to .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
288.78	Yeah , you can put it separate .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
442.25	Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
466.93	Just make make a Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
674.12	Just make it 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1030.25	Make them No , just make them black or grey or something .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1051.21	Yeah , just give it a one .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1065.32	Okay , just give it a two .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1259.88	Okay , just Easy to use is very cool , so just give it a two .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1336.5	Yeah , just draw it afterwards .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1616.04	Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
1623.3	So you can put a recharger in it as well .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1659.7	So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[evalu]
1676.91	We can do some discussion about this .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1883.63	You can do it from here .	TS3004d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
172.06	Do we Do we change the 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
211.51	So , it will come up .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
299.29	Think I can Uh , what this just an example .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
308.46	get a number in here .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
334.6	And in the end , we will c uh count an average 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	count	[]	[]	[]
503.09	Um , so I would give it a two .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
553.52	Yes , I'll think of that too .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
581.91	So , I would give this a five .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
655.77	But you can you can go for that .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
661.66	So , I would give this a two .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
733.61	Uh yeah , did we achieve that .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	achieve	[]	[]	[]
736.39	I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
838.38	I We'll go for a three .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
879.97	So um , come back to the presentation now .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
890.75	So , we will do that .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
916.59	Come on .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
1117.86	We would have uh n 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1135.6	If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[joystick]
1701.12	Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1742.52	To tell their opinion .	TS3010d.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
123.01	And if you have both you can um well , you can compare this to to one stored and so get out uh which person it is .	IN1009.B.words.xml	compare	[]	[]	[]
178.1	Well once you get this information , your frequency and uh your vocal contract or how it's called , uh y you can use this information to compare to to to the frames here .	IN1009.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
207.32	That that that everything is done through through the voice here , you take a voice of someone , and then you can get out this information , it's it's not p it's clear it's not perfect , but s it's enough to to to use it for for different purposes and uh 	IN1009.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
316.31	I have to I want to check it , I can show it you afterwards .	IN1009.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
332.96	I should reread what I signed there so .	IN1009.B.words.xml	reread	[]	[]	[]
518.87	Sound .	IN1009.B.words.xml	Sound	[]	[]	[]
617.28	You might might want to do .	IN1009.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
767.65	No , but I think once you have the voice for a person , you can start to do this and uh once uh people have speech recognition or uh far enough to t 	IN1009.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1090.58	Does it work if I put in my email and uh 	IN1009.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
674.83	Yeah we could just go with um 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
845.12	Um it's probably just I dunno if it's worth getting into , but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
923.41	Do you want me to d um 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
942.91	Um , alright so the way this works , I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint , I'll try and do it as quick as possible .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
963.47	Let me get that .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
979.64	The idea is that I've set up I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , and uh so we can review that .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	review	[]	[]	[]
1021.99	So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , okay .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1096.14	Let's go with two point five then .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1098.37	Okay , um control high tech innovation .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[]
1142.07	Okay so we'll go two .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1187.9	It would cost more than plastic .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[]
1280.54	I did have one other um one other frame I thought , I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information , I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1304.47	Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant , I dunno the Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	involve	[]	[]	[Whatever]
1319.04	I mean obviously we can just abandon this , it's fine .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	abandon	[]	[]	[]
1440.43	To use .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1461.28	Well , is it uh okay I'll just go through your system then .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1553.05	So what do we do .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1554.05	We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	build	[twelve and a]	[]	[]
1680.98	I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1781.9	Fully agree .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1924.59	Um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1971.22	Think could be , yeah .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1992.07	Yeah , because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush , for example , or whatever , I would've actually used it , um 'ca you know , just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time .	ES2002d.C.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[PowerPoint, Paintbrush]
2383.59	Do we retreat to our , to continue our 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	retreat	[]	[]	[]
485.73	See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
511.3	Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
518.22	and we can put the price up .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
570.29	manually change channels or volume .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
576.25	yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
623.64	Maybe like it'll beep or something .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	beep	[]	[]	[]
704.42	And uh it would cut out the R.S.I. as well if you 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	cut	[]	[]	[R.S.I.]
730.53	I'll read out to you .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[]
754.94	So m we can maybe even start to cut down on or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
767.87	So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , which are low relevance and rarely used .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
775.3	And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
903.61	You could just put it down once on top your T.V. and never have to 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[T.V.]
997.96	Stand out .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	Stand	[]	[]	[]
1048.5	'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just you address the remote , you address the computer , and then give it a command .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1113.39	We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1129.42	alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1156.89	We c yeah , we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1166.11	So uh yeah , if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	power	[]	[]	[]
1176.67	Yeah and probably it would look better as well .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1250.63	Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1878.12	It could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time .	ES2012b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
83.26	Stay .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	Stay	[]	[]	[]
207.64	Yeah , but most m most browsers , when when you uh put an X.M.L. file up in it , it'll just apply some default style sheet to it anyway that shows you 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	apply	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
459.08	'Cause you know , like a wee bus journey over to Maplin might solve the problem if it's getting in the way .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	solve	[]	[]	[Maplin]
495.46	When you get worried , go to Maplin , okay .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Maplin]
498.37	Phone them first to make sure that they're in there .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	Phone	[]	[]	[]
500.19	Somebody around must have a uh probably Steve .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Steve]
503.16	Somebody in the techie group will have a Maplin catalogue .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Maplin]
525.05	So you can find out whether they have it .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
526.86	But you'd have to phone over to find out if they have it in stock down there .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
572.35	Yeah , then , you know , put your mind at rest .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
857.97	And I'll just check .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
893.12	you know , how to submit costs and stuff like that .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	submit	[]	[]	[]
895.46	So um but that suggests he's at at the end of things , but w we could just ask him .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
950.24	Ach , try phone .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[Ach]
970.2	Yeah , or re change the schedule .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1099.99	Yeah , and then escalate , I guess .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	escalate	[]	[]	[]
1123.43	Um I v might talk to Ellen about that ahead of time 'cause uh they may have she and Martin may have had discussions about appropriate use of the lab .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[Ellen, Martin]
1384.13	You can um call a JAST telcon between you and Marloes .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[JAST, Marloes]
1424.05	I'd just hate for that to c um to slow you up in collecting stuff , that's all .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	hate	[]	[]	[]
1449.94	It's just to provide advice about this , which must take take less time .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1559.47	So so we'll worry about it then .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	worry	[]	[]	[]
1604.42	Or Do y 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[]
1722.11	We'll find we'll find plenty of really really crucial s things for you to do .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1742.51	So uh I'll uh remind myself to look at what's next before the next time we get together .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	remind	[]	[]	[]
1792.85	Anyway um you'll tell me whether it we cancel this .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1814.08	Let's see , that's like the 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1846.67	'Cause people do ask me .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1874.37	Well , if they were gonna do that then they'd force you to go to it .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	force	[]	[]	[]
1877.77	I would and I would know somebody who'd gone to know .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
2034.01	Um if you do then the people formulating research questions will ask about them .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
2044.92	You can stick 'em in a different um track and uh and then load 'em or not load 'em as you please .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
2156.6	You'd want blinks as a separate tier if you're gonna have it in .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2406.21	Wait .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
2497.18	So you might still wanna have everything in this one G.D.F. file format that represents everything .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[G.D.F.]
2816.94	Uh yeah , I can imagine I can imagine that also requiring some discussion about whether what they do is what we actually wanna do .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
2929.94	Find out what's next .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	Find	[]	[]	[]
2931.11	You could give give Craig more work to do .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[Craig]
2939.27	Oh yeah , well that'll take forever .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2943.27	Check your batteries .	EN2009c.B.words.xml	Check	[]	[]	[]
556.98	You can connect this one .	IS1000b.D.words.xml	connect	[]	[]	[]
591.54	Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
822.65	I can move as far as 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
859.28	Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important .	IS1000b.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
882.82	And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , alright .	IS1000b.D.words.xml	compose	[]	[]	[]
917.39	I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work .	IS1000b.D.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
938.87	w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design .	IS1000b.D.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1138.29	We will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared and uh 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1187.51	That can control o other things .	IS1000b.D.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[]
1197.01	Of course yeah we should take that into account in the uh 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
335.814	Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
588.474	Because we use spec uh specic uh 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	specic	[]	[]	[spec]
634.804	Well , b basically it when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
669.684	Maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple , but that's not what uh has been asked .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
677.5039999999999	So we should kick the board's uh Well 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	kick	[]	[]	[]
769.684	Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	determine	[]	[]	[]
834.674	You should taste it .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	taste	[]	[]	[]
851.544	So do 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
973.924	Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1163.964	Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	respond	[]	[]	[]
1264.274	Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1292.0639999999999	You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1384.004	You can use your voice to to programme it .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1399.464	Yeah , I'll give it a one .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1514.764	Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	learn	[]	[]	[]
1904.734	And and uh w you were when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[Windows]
1945.624	Pop uh pop up the champagne .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	pop	[]	[]	[]
2118.924	Let's wrap it up .	TS3011d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
816.73	Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
828.29	But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
836.87	Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	deliver	[]	[]	[]
863.41	Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
887.25	Form should follow function overall .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	follow	[]	[]	[]
979.92	We could use the basic normal battery .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1134.02	So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1390.61	I'll have to uh research .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1540.6	And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	deliver	[]	[]	[]
1550.07	Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	affect	[]	[]	[]
1564.12	Pick one you like , yes .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	Pick	[]	[]	[]
1871.76	So I could draw them out .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1880.24	Let's look at the flat case .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2088.03	Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page .	TS3003c.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
356.51	Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , I'm little , you can get to the top , with standing on a chair .	ES2004a.D.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
454.0	I hope that clicks in , I'll just I'll hold it on , okay .	ES2004a.D.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
465.38	Hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version .	ES2004a.D.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
511.49	I suppose they're all so independent , I'd put that one down again .	ES2004a.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
547.15	I'll put that , intrepid .	ES2004a.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
553.66	There we go , hope that pen's gonna be okay .	ES2004a.D.words.xml	hope	[]	[]	[]
779.78	Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you've got a little L.C.D. display .	ES2004a.D.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
935.18	The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .	ES2004a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
163.53	I can go first , yeah .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
218.86	So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
262.14	Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
278.26	Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[]
392.83	The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[interf, interface]
469.66	Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
506.19	This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
511.5	And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
612.24	I it'll take some time .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
632.27	It'll come up , it um uh no signal .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1003.5	Yeah , and it'll make the costs yeah .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1029.38	So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
1033.6	Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L.C.D. display and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1117.24	try to press oh , okay , yep .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1608.69	That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1751.52	But how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh h ho how good is it , you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1862.24	If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I.T.V. one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[I.T.V.]
1955.35	Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl I mean it'll it'll mm .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
1974.93	So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T.V. , so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is .	ES2006b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[T.V.]
27.14	We may do .	IS1002c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
292.03	Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it .	IS1002c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[ge]
786.23	Uh e excuse that , that's a bit of spam .	IS1002c.A.words.xml	excuse	[]	[]	[]
1058.64	dock to put it in to to charge it .	IS1002c.A.words.xml	dock	[]	[]	[]
1061.03	We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things .	IS1002c.A.words.xml	target	[]	[]	[]
1084.88	So if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	market	[]	[]	[]
1228.83	decide on well y you guys basically have to now go and 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1234.35	figure out the details of this thing .	IS1002c.A.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
1562.99	You could basically make it so that it'll I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T.V. yeah the T.V.'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once .	IS1002c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
1574.26	Other than click click click .	IS1002c.A.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1658.31	You'd need a display on the th the thing .	IS1002c.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1706.68	You could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply .	IS1002c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1753.88	You could have back-lit buttons maybe .	IS1002c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1780.24	And if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that you know if it's actually pressed or not .	IS1002c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1887.17	on the other hand I would think , 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1899.01	If I had a cool new T.V. and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which I think's a really cool idea , that would sell me on it a little .	IS1002c.A.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[T.V.]
148.12	quickly give you 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
194.02	enable us to complete the project in time .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	enable	[]	[]	[]
212.8	meet the technical requirements .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
586.96	Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
745.86	And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
879.58	And so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
915.27	And then have to change all change everything at the last minute .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1071.76	So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in you know like a You'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1092.11	Anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1171.9	So you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1238.88	So that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
1287.51	You could have volume up and volume Volume up , down and Like that .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Volume]
1542.45	Stand-by button .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	Stand	[]	[]	[]
1559.78	But but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	incorporate	[year, next year's]	[]	[]
1698.3	You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that , and especially 'cause then you could make it something that 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1799.18	You could have your company badge and logo .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1801.46	I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , you know , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that uh in a sense , with a with a logo like that , because it's on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1942.23	If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2252.8	We should now go away and get these things sorted out .	ES2014c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
115.23	Uh I will introduce myself , uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	introduce	[]	[]	[]
178.95	They uh they wanna do something else .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
313.42	So uh if you have uh drawn something , save it .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
322.67	Uh little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
333.18	Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal , and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
362.07	It's uh it's uh I I I must do it .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
369.66	So getting used to each other , we can uh have a little fun then , before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
393.78	So hold it uh like this .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
404.12	You must p p uh push a little uh Good .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	p	[]	[]	[]
406.89	Because And uh wait uh wait a few seconds .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
480.43	Yeah , you can guess what it is .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	guess	[]	[]	[]
486.45	May uh paint uh next .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	paint	[]	[]	[]
548.73	Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
567.88	So choose a colour , choose a pen width and draw a 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
576.74	Save it , okay .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
757.15	And then you have the the current colour , you can change .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1030.88	we can sell our r remotes to .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
1047.06	You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1056.57	What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	distinguish	[]	[]	[]
1142.05	Uh no , I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[Word, Shared, Documents]
1269.79	So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
1332.84	Okay , uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1335.94	So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1437.64	Will come in handy .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1496.18	So uh each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1511.67	I must finish off now , so it's over .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	finish	[]	[]	[]
1513.29	You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach .	TS3007a.A.words.xml	receive	[]	[]	[]
134.64	Yes , maybe we should phone him .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	phone	[]	[]	[]
195.49	so maybe Anna , you can have your presentation .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Anna]
218.46	Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[ma]
427.09	Yeah no you can carry on , I just 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	carry	[]	[]	[]
430.15	look how it feels all .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
442.16	So but but continue with your uh mm-hmm .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	continue	[]	[]	[]
731.97	do it quickly if if we al already .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
912.53	Um well w w we can still discuss that .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
916.04	So um , and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive , but 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
961.6	So maybe we can start with this , uh , calling this one .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
998.18	Look and feel .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
1016.44	purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
1025.76	But that's just half , we should also consider look , and then 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
1074.13	Can you maybe fix the other 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	fix	[]	[]	[]
1109.74	Mm , try it , just try it .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1523.53	Mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[Mm]
1628.72	Wh what what 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	Wh	[]	[]	[]
1718.38	We can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
1758.69	Maybe we can but we have to decide it , we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers and s now try to invest in the in in the features .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1837.94	Say , say one and two .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
1858.23	Just add it .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1881.87	We we must try to get them closer .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1888.63	And adapt .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	adapt	[]	[]	[]
1933.19	Well yes , well uh re reconsider it .	IS1000d.B.words.xml	reconsider	[]	[]	[]
1998.84	Oh yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape , but , actually bu 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	bu	[]	[]	[]
2076.43	So I think but th do you agree th that thi 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
2452.16	Ca can I have can the functions be implement in an 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
661.9	Okay , now you can go to to my slides , but actually what I pre what I have prepared is just a kind of a review of fo uh se six or seven movies , if you ca can go to the second slide .	IB4010.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
687.77	So um we can perhaps go through all of them and we can little bit discuss , so I I I have n I didn't see all of them actually , so it's just we should probably select one of these , because I think uh these are really good movies and uh , okay , we will see .	IB4010.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
741.33	Because then perhaps someone can give some some comment .	IB4010.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
897.14	So I would keep it as a candidate , at least .	IB4010.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1091.14	When going through we c we could just eliminate .	IB4010.C.words.xml	eliminate	[]	[]	[]
1101.87	But you can read the comment from the users , uh that's the that's the last uh bullet point , and it says uh simply a masterpiece uh , and it's uh Scorsese's last really great movie to date .	IB4010.C.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[Scorsese]
1350.34	So American Beauty , so I can perhaps read a little bit the user comment if you want , or uh yeah , you can read the plot outline on the on the on the projector , but it's basically deep , wonderful and penetrating movie , extraordinary uh irony and the p and the psychological drama about American life .	IB4010.C.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[American, Beauty]
1473.66	Um what do you think , I mean what should we how we should uh 	IB4010.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1938.96	Yeah , but in the end you can ref yes .	IB4010.C.words.xml	ref	[]	[]	[]
2021.97	If he would kill him , he wouldn't die .	IB4010.C.words.xml	kill	[]	[]	[]
2603.58	I yes , yeah , I I would like to uh , yeah , at least to have it uh in the 	IB4010.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2776.15	Yeah , and I would eliminate 	IB4010.C.words.xml	eliminate	[]	[]	[]
2780.52	And I would eliminate Pulp Fiction actually as well if so 	IB4010.C.words.xml	eliminate	[]	[]	[Pulp, Fiction]
2827.97	Make a decision .	IB4010.C.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
158.61	Well everybody already has his presentation , so you can adjust it .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	adjust	[]	[]	[]
486.4	And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	turn	[]	[medsa]	[]
493.36	Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C.D. if you use it your C.D. player the remote control will that one .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[teletext, C.D., C.D.]
558.76	Because all the T.V.s will have them .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.s]
564.84	And then uh make it I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
571.5	If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
582.78	The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	reuse	[]	[]	[]
611.66	You must still have it open .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
996.96	Then it should have uh on , off , and uh 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1056.6	Yeah , so you should have that one on .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1192.94	So you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	adjust	[]	[]	[]
1319.48	Well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's uh too expensive .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1446.81	We should think of the twelve fifty we have but 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1536.87	But you'll also forget to put it in , because you throw it on the couch and you don't remember .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	forget	[]	[]	[]
1681.09	You can clap or something .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	clap	[]	[]	[]
1788.52	Yeah you can use icons for the 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1841.1	You could use that n as an option , if you have money left , or something .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1847.52	Let's do speech .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1950.27	You'll have to search for it .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1987.0	Yeah , you could look here all the the 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1995.75	They're a bit small , you can we should stretch them , because 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	stretch	[]	[]	[]
2021.08	Or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and yeah .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2030.8	Yeah , so we should also implement se screen settings .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	implement	[]	[]	[]
2040.28	Yeah , so you can program the 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	program	[]	[]	[]
2079.33	And do we want them in different colours , or 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2102.23	Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2145.88	So you can program the T.V. .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	program	[]	[]	[T.V.]
2150.9	Perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
2295.14	To turn it on .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
2298.23	Of or you should put it in the L.C.D. screen .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
2312.24	Well I I guess if you use the L.C.D. screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you uh you you then turn it , and then the T.V. goes on .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[L.C.D., T.V.]
2353.2	If we can afford it .	TS3005b.B.words.xml	afford	[]	[]	[]
74.59	Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push .	ES2012d.B.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
92.04	This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it .	ES2012d.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
100.92	Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it'll still understand .	ES2012d.B.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
187.05	Yeah it could stand , yeah .	ES2012d.B.words.xml	stand	[]	[]	[]
188.98	Well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that .	ES2012d.B.words.xml	broaden	[]	[]	[]
203.97	Yeah , we could just widen it out uh 	ES2012d.B.words.xml	widen	[]	[]	[]
220.63	Have to if we just lengthen it I guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there .	ES2012d.B.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
232.31	We might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that .	ES2012d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
249.29	The final product would actually stand up , yeah .	ES2012d.B.words.xml	stand	[]	[]	[]
288.72	Let's see .	ES2014a.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
359.65	Um and they can look after themselves .	ES2014a.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
0.02	I'll wait until you're all um hooked up .	ES2004c.B.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
52.39	Put it on in that way .	ES2004c.B.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
116.64	to do with that already , but we'll just go over it .	ES2004c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
816.29	Well add it in to think about um 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
919.88	Can we what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1169.94	So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off .	ES2004c.B.words.xml	pull	[]	[]	[fascia, fascia]
1322.37	Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	distinguish	[]	[]	[]
1350.45	It would have to be attached .	ES2004c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1374.37	Okay , we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that .	ES2004c.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
1635.33	That's what I was just saying , and then have the and then have the L.C.D. at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls , so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that , on the lower side .	ES2004c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1813.06	Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it .	ES2004c.B.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[li]
2033.84	So we could just pick anything .	ES2004c.B.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
2094.28	And you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2116.3	And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes y you know , you could just go so far with it , like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so I think that's quite a flexible thing .	ES2004c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2250.35	Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it .	ES2004c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2277.63	um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about .	ES2004c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
176.5	Okay , yeah I'll go first .	ES2004b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
177.91	Can I grab the 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	grab	[]	[]	[]
257.38	But uh although we will want to be taking 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
337.69	Yeah the the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across .	ES2004b.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
443.35	which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I.R. data which could be decoded by the T.V. receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	convert	[]	[I.R.]	[T.V.]
1109.05	If yeah and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T.V. anyway so on to on to like the T.V. hard drive or so .	ES2004b.C.words.xml	record	[]	[]	[Sky, T.V., T.V.]
1647.81	Just whack in the number .	ES2004b.C.words.xml	whack	[]	[]	[]
1703.3	Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series .	ES2004b.C.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[Sky]
1879.56	Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	bundle	[]	[]	[]
1933.38	Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine , and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time .	ES2004b.C.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
240.92	Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons .	TS3003d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
244.92	And you But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel .	TS3003d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
334.76	Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh Yeah .	TS3003d.B.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
397.12	Just to recognise it , so uh 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	recognise	[]	[]	[]
403.56	Y uh s some uh remote controls uh do it also , but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it .	TS3003d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
467.88	Yeah we can u just uh 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	u	[]	[]	[]
890.83	So uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty .	TS3003d.B.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
1318.4	But uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one .	TS3003d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2163.02	Uh so uh you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet , or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory .	TS3003d.B.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
2182.2	T can uh can you export it uh like a Yeah .	TS3003d.B.words.xml	export	[]	[]	[]
2228.3	Um , yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2527.21	Uh maybe uh they will save it .	TS3003d.B.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
567.19	Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B.B.C. four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have a certain number of favourites um and that w 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[B.B.C.]	[say]
635.07	Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , you know , hundred and fifty pounds or something .	ES2012c.C.words.xml	tend	[]	[]	[]
701.87	Well , another thought I oh , sorry , go ahead .	ES2012c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
851.17	Well , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing .	ES2012c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
923.99	Let's see .	ES2012c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1004.81	Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like .	ES2012c.C.words.xml	Bring	[]	[]	[]
1008.31	So just kind of minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator .	ES2012c.C.words.xml	minimise	[]	[]	[]
1510.74	Yeah , just another five Euro to get 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[Euro]
1688.42	So that , you know , when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1702.14	have the power , wherever , somewhere .	ES2012c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1738.74	And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light , the infrared light at the T.V. and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something .	ES2012c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1859.25	We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume .	ES2012c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1863.71	So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume .	ES2012c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1889.5	Yeah , press that is t yeah , that might work .	ES2012c.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1900.0	Yeah , and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select .	ES2012c.C.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
2172.54	So you could use like this and it would go .	ES2012c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
449.32	Seal , a seal .	TS3005a.C.words.xml	Seal	[]	[]	[]
547.94	Make that cute .	TS3005a.C.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
883.43	to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em .	TS3005a.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
942.98	think so .	TS3005a.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1004.37	to make it user friendly .	TS3005a.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1116.8	So we should take that in consideration .	TS3005a.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1128.71	Things'll come up .	TS3005a.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[Things'll]
1162.32	Stop the meeting now .	TS3005a.C.words.xml	Stop	[]	[]	[]
1187.12	No , the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design , and the in uh usability interaction Yeah , okay .	TS3005a.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
635.44	Yeah s then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
651.57	Yeah so I'll I'll go with that actually so um 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
671.11	Okay so m so then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms , and uh they could be like buttons or like and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
752.42	There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , like You can basically if you have a multiple functionality , say T.V. , V.C.R. or something I say it to the T.V. and the T.V. , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	programme	[]	[]	[T.V., V.C.R., T.V., T.V.]
905.38	I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote , is uh um is a good idea , like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1109.62	We well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can uh check how much how much they yeah yeah yeah .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1121.23	Maybe we can come we we can talk to them , and we can come with that , you know .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1126.16	And also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , so you really need a some kind of indicator , so it could be a blinking option of L.E.D. it could actually be used to detect also .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[che, L.E.D.]
1145.51	If it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	detect	[]	[]	[]
1176.17	It may need more actually , so y you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1214.85	Sure you can you know .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1557.76	What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1574.53	Okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1744.21	Yeah we we can give a preference to them , but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1847.56	We can give them smooth keys , you know .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1858.63	The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together to 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	merge	[]	[]	[]
1875.83	Oh you can actually , for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here , and uh now you can , for example , as I was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1981.94	We should make a 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1988.83	Yeah that would depend upon us actually .	IS1000c.C.words.xml	depend	[]	[]	[]
40.36	Yeah , we yeah , you can get back to it .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
120.3	You know , give me give me what's happening every X. seconds .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[X.]
122.51	It's more like , you know , give me the fixations and the um the blinks .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
157.42	But you'll get uh what you want is to figure out what are the um the concepts behind that data that you want represented .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
406.01	See if the pens work .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
591.75	So , you know , he might get triangle one there and no maybe this one's gonna overlook lap quite a bit .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
629.02	So you could do it on 'cause i it's just a matter of i the hard part is deciding how close together these have to be before you decide that this is a event that you wanna pull out .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
735.69	So I g I guess this is a case of Craig writing some scripts so Robin having some ideas about what the relationship is and saying , you know , add this data a automatically .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[Craig, Robin]
747.69	It's just there'll be a bunch of these , you'll have some rules about how maybe how long you spend on other objects and w whether the other object is um the existing construction or not , right .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
858.71	Which is um well , how would you decide whether something was the current addendum uh the cu 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
962.55	I could believe them , yeah , no , taking an interest in that .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	believe	[]	[]	[]
1009.74	But I mean with transaction coding on something like this you would use i y you wouldn't consider it verbal analysis exactly .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1234.16	And then we've got no option but to uh figure out a way for like to look at this , just explore this data , suggest ways about doing it and um be able to play them back and see um when we think we've got these things right .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	explore	[]	[]	[]
1369.7	Fixations and the percentage of time those fixations cover , you might want .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1529.36	We can put that in as another track .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1573.78	So it's the number of fixations the did you want the you 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1614.46	And uh y did you want the percentage of time fixated as opposed to which is sort of another view of this number .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1623.08	You can have as many of these as 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1807.04	Yeah , but i in in the analysis you should treat those as completely separate tracks of information .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	treat	[]	[]	[]
1811.81	Because they can be looking at they could look sim simultaneously at somebody's mouse , somebody's gaze and some object , right .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1969.88	'Cause they can happen at the same time .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	happen	[]	[]	[]
2249.32	Did they jointly look at square one .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2251.47	Did they jointly look at you know , you need some way of uh uh going over the whole thing .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2271.4	And it'll probably ruin their viewer .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	ruin	[]	[]	[]
2273.55	'Cause you'll get very sparse data on each track .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2297.81	Yeah , and we b we better also like have in the representational list of par like even in the N.X.T. up-translation a list of parts .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[N.X.T.]
2575.33	That'll cover most of 'em .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	cover	[]	[]	[]
2675.14	So you can tell what it's meant to replace then .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
2888.5	I think we've gotten to the point where , you know , to try to summarise , uh we we think Tim's program can do both of these conditions that you want .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[Tim]
2922.77	So I'll summarise what we said about that part that um every time you cast off a new part from a mold or , you know , every black triangle has a different I.D. .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	summarise	[]	[]	[I.D.]
3132.16	So we can easily look at things like that automatically .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
3213.53	When they decide to move it past the mold line , they're p doing something with it probably and you'll know what they're gonna do with it because 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
3282.74	Remember m all the things we're looking at are f with language with and without language .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
3299.79	So we should well we should make a wish list , right , as a side effect .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
3336.99	they could discuss deciding to break something and and then one guy does it .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
3538.65	So uh well and um hold on , before we get go any further .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
3589.3	You can dump 'em into one video frame if you don't mind losing resolution .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	dump	[]	[]	[]
3702.02	So you so you should start the Camtasia really early then .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	start	[]	[Camtasia]	[]
3953.04	Right , so we can either adjust the eye trai track data or we can actually chop the audio signal to take off the first whatever , however many seconds .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	adjust	[]	[]	[]
4121.85	'Cause , you know , people might wanna use this for speech recognition or something .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
4143.7	Better to collect and sort .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	collect	[]	[]	[]
4154.32	Wait wait , w I I thought the sol that a better solution was fixing this problem with the mono microphone socket .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[mono]
4500.09	But I think the thing to do is um for you to go away and think about it this way with the different tracks for the different objects and the um the kinds of things we've added about whether they're looking at the other person's gaze and what have you , and and try to change the spec so it it reflects this and maybe um oh maybe by that point there will be some sample data or something uh and the right thing to do is for us to look at the sp the spec the way you understand it now and some data .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
4660.3	So I would assume , you know , no more contact with Joe .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	assume	[]	[]	[Joe]
4665.91	So you know , ask Craig instead .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[Craig]
4716.97	And we can make Craig shift all his other priorities to do this 'cause we bought him .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Craig]
4764.92	You can cold call her today , this afternoon .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	cold	[today]	[]	[]
4820.68	Come on .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
4962.84	See , 'cause you're supposed to uh have training in 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
5069.53	'Cause I should c I should check that .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
5113.1	Well I can just leave you guys here , you know .	EN2009d.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
410.31	Wait wait .	IN1016.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
478.16	Okay , but do how do why do you want certain words .	IN1016.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
803.36	Mm yeah , you can do that , yeah .	IN1016.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1300.61	Go on .	IN1016.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1463.8	And uh should go uh in one or uh one d yeah .	IN1016.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1470.04	Uh the it may be good as a C.V. for you , but then as a thesis you will have problems uh defending it and all those things .	IN1016.D.words.xml	have	[]	[C.V.]	[]
1601.01	Someone may work on some other problem .	IN1016.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1608.72	And uh and as I also t it depends like also like I think if uh boss is interested in working in both speech and text , you can understand very well .	IN1016.D.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
2093.17	No , it it's it's uh quite a bit , yeah , problem , to do that kind of thing .	IN1016.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2129.22	Suppose there's like the the white-board or whatever , the presentation is over there , the speaker is more probably is going to this way or that way .	IN1016.D.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
2291.21	You can look at it .	IN1016.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2578.17	Either stop it 	IN1016.D.words.xml	stop	[]	[]	[]
2795.4	Yeah , yeah , to submit , yeah .	IN1016.D.words.xml	submit	[]	[]	[]
2829.63	Call routing where .	IN1016.D.words.xml	Call	[]	[]	[]
3072.8	Or you and he can uh we can try to use uh France Telecom's uh approach actually .	IN1016.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[France, Telecom]
3087.63	And plus it can give you a voice activity detection .	IN1016.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
3091.68	Part f part from basis it can give .	IN1016.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
3095.01	So somethi we can just yeah , we can just run it quickly and see .	IN1016.D.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[]
3099.84	And probably you will have to run it .	IN1016.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3122.37	But probably uh he should run it I mean to say .	IN1016.D.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[]
3140.68	Uh for to make it faster we should ru it run maybe .	IN1016.D.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[]
3292.26	No anyway , so we okay , so we'll finish this call routing stuff .	IN1016.D.words.xml	finish	[]	[]	[]
3357.11	Probably you should start , I think .	IN1016.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
3408.67	Yeah , it can go there , yeah .	IN1016.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
3411.54	See 	IN1016.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
3418.82	As a research report you put here , submit it for the conference .	IN1016.D.words.xml	submit	[]	[]	[]
95.7	Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it .	IS1004a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
123.88	As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company .	IS1004a.A.words.xml	follow	[]	[]	[]
140.97	During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next .	IS1004a.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
605.3	Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants .	IS1004a.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
621.26	So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control 	IS1004a.A.words.xml	target	[]	[]	[Euro]
638.75	And we should target the inter an international market .	IS1004a.A.words.xml	target	[]	[]	[]
657.78	So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go .	IS1004a.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
736.49	Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do .	IS1004a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
758.49	Um you will receive some information by emails , i as usual .	IS1004a.A.words.xml	receive	[]	[]	[]
67.88	I'll just put that there .	ES2016a.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
93.67	Go ahead .	ES2016a.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
303.04	Um do we have um 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
309.66	any ideas of of maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
400.16	So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[]
429.79	Do we want so they're kinda like long and rectangular .	ES2016a.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
616.22	marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there .	ES2016a.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
667.28	Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there .	ES2016a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
676.22	We want it to be a b a ball , you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located .	ES2016a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
803.64	How would we go about um 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
877.3	So if no , go ahead .	ES2016a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
951.7	So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better .	ES2016a.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1030.55	Let's see here .	ES2016a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1074.04	Course that'll then remove some of our our ball .	ES2016a.A.words.xml	remove	[]	[]	[]
1331.26	Okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	finish	[]	[]	[]
1357.77	Must finish now , so .	ES2016a.A.words.xml	finish	[]	[]	[]
1360.86	And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want .	ES2016a.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1370.94	And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around , be a little bit more prepared .	ES2016a.A.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[Project, Manager]
490.01	We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
594.64	Click , don't Yeah .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	Click	[]	[]	[]
767.49	Um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1144.12	Then your lights would go off , though .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1269.18	Mm you can just click .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1273.97	You just click anywhere .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1431.03	And it's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it's a common issue .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1467.39	and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1492.61	You know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1505.28	It w it would increase the cost .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
1513.56	And you could page the remote if you lose it .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	page	[]	[]	[]
1541.93	what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[ho, Pedro]
1618.82	But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2084.18	Yeah we we need to , I mean , have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is , you know , the best fit .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2159.11	just to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up .	IS1002b.B.words.xml	touch	[]	[]	[]
103.62	I can hold it like 	ES2004d.A.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
337.51	So when it's even if it's open here , the signals would go .	ES2004d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
404.82	Look up to it .	ES2004d.A.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
1227.56	No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , we can put point five .	ES2004d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1238.0	We can use that .	ES2004d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1516.96	Make it costly .	ES2004d.A.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1921.75	Yep , sorry , go on Sarah .	ES2004d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Sarah]
204.33	I'll just um I'll grab the wire out the back of this one .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	grab	[]	[]	[]
243.9	Control 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	Control	[]	[]	[]
373.06	And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
391.17	Whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	vary	[]	[]	[]
401.46	Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	channel	[]	[]	[]
442.28	I'll just go through there .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
796.51	So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	dispense	[]	[]	[]
961.32	So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	pass	[]	[]	[]
1349.73	Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1354.38	So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
1436.0	you could have an option to turn it off .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1442.35	So that would solve the problems with the T.V. kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	solve	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1728.18	Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , and if something comes back 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	concentrate	[]	[]	[]
1774.54	I'd go more Yeah , f more for clap .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1804.74	Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1827.94	I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1928.58	Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2022.1	Keep the other buttons but hide them away .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	Keep	[]	[]	[]
2070.95	Should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	decide	[the next couple of minutes]	[]	[]
2128.33	We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
2148.2	Okay , so we'll have um 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2198.31	Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
2221.64	Um up Tune one way , tune the o I I dunno I dunno possibly .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	tune	[]	[]	[]
2290.28	Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2296.68	Well shall we look into that and just get back together .	ES2014b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
798.37	Yeah , it's strange , with so many votes that they can p shift .	IB4011.B.words.xml	shift	[]	[]	[]
1197.56	Though it's a very useful table , but um okay , do you want me to yeah .	IB4011.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1341.88	Well it's very strange , you could s ask this for any sad movie , did you enjoy it .	IB4011.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1388.83	Um on the second page uh of my notes I well I quoted some uh well some facts about the movie that I found interesting , we we could use them for either a poster or uh or a presentation .	IB4011.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1522.42	It's probably a bit long and we might want something that is lighter and funnier , but uh if we want to keep this this idea of history and conflict and also to show some some kind of modern treatment of it , it it would make for a good choice .	IB4011.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
2065.27	Well I'll nominate the one I proposed , Saving Private Ryan , so history , war , drem drama .	IB4011.B.words.xml	nominate	[]	[]	[Saving, Private, Ryan, drem]
2148.84	Oh yeah , um well it's uh well if I nominated two and I was the only one , I'll give two points to Saving Private Ryan and one to American Beauty .	IB4011.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[Saving, Private, Ryan, American, Beauty]
2164.9	Then you'd better hurry .	IB4011.B.words.xml	hurry	[]	[]	[]
2182.89	Um okay , so I'll give um uh b um 	IB4011.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2269.03	Maybe you can leave those .	IB4011.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
2277.92	Oh leave Julianne Moore .	IB4011.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[Julianne, Moore]
2324.28	So uh we'll try a movie from the two thousands .	IB4011.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2329.23	And we can meet at the beginning of May .	IB4011.B.words.xml	meet	[the beginning of May]	[]	[]
2375.99	Let's cross the bridge when we get to it .	IB4011.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
712.87	Horns , draw some horns .	ES2006a.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1139.08	there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , maybe to do 	ES2006a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1145.93	So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them .	ES2006a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
211.0	Okay , welcome everyone to our next meeting .	TS3005c.A.words.xml	welcome	[]	[]	[]
236.96	Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder , 	TS3005c.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
247.56	Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts .	TS3005c.A.words.xml	take	[today]	[]	[]
272.83	Well , take it away .	TS3005c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1421.96	Okay well maybe , if I can interrupt you , maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision .	TS3005c.A.words.xml	interrupt	[]	[]	[]
1430.63	So we can discuss these points .	TS3005c.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1438.96	How how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it .	TS3005c.A.words.xml	supply	[]	[]	[]
2087.7	Yeah because a microphone is very small thing , but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote .	TS3005c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2297.62	Yeah I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue , just 	TS3005c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2328.43	Um here are the individual actions , and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board , and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach .	TS3005c.A.words.xml	notice	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer, User, Interface, Designer]
10.25	Unless uh things have suddenly change again .	TS3011c.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
301.75	Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .	TS3011c.D.words.xml	watch	[]	[]	[Sponge, Bob]
429.94	and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .	TS3011c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
439.0	So we could provide 	TS3011c.D.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[]
1143.0	So it might attract uh the young customers .	TS3011c.D.words.xml	attract	[]	[]	[]
14.22	She did admit it .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	admit	[]	[]	[]
96.3	See last week by the time everything and and then it'll be hopefully no more than , I don't know what , twenty minutes today to 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	See	[last week, today]	[]	[]
314.01	Yep , make sure it uh it starts and finishes when it's meant to and that sort of thing as well .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
466.55	Want it a reasonable size so that if they're looking at it we know they're looking at it though .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	Want	[]	[]	[]
544.26	So I'll check that out uh to see if it really is a problem or not .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
557.86	Just total it flipped uh in in a mirror image .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	total	[]	[]	[]
715.65	So uh no it does look like it's uh M.S.N. .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[M.S.N.]
745.92	Because it it does have sort of sum of angles and things .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
779.07	'Cause they'll have they'll have to have a central point anyway for for rotation and and grabbing .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
794.91	Well uh uh realise what we're I would consider that two parts , yep .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	realise	[]	[]	[]
1286.58	Spend .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	Spend	[]	[]	[]
1332.21	Uh what el uh well I'll have to get to grips with cra Camtasia uh properly uh to generate a little sort of introductory video I suppose uh for instructional purposes at the beginning of the experiment .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[Camtasia]	[el, cra]
1423.74	Might use .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1516.6	But I'll I'll I better I'll I'll remind her yeah , I'll I'll I'll do that .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	remind	[]	[]	[]
1533.02	Actually I I did email Nijmegen to ask if they'd had a set of instructions they'd given their participants , but it probably I s I suspect so because I haven't had a reply back .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	email	[]	[]	[Nijmegen]
1631.28	So one page will have sort of parts that are kind of similar to each other and then you move over and there's a different almost type of design or style .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1659.0	Uh I'll try I'll try .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1739.3	I'll try and find out .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1747.18	Uh I'll I'll do a search .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1850.73	Have to 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
1854.91	To try and , yes , and home home in parameters and choose the right sort of settings .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1899.62	It's in the royal proceedings of something or other somewhere based on a um an experiment that had blocks a model , blocks of parts and then an area where people had to build , you know , replicate the model out with the parts .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	replicate	[]	[]	[]
1918.75	But uh it did involve um eye movements and monitoring where they're looking compared to their hand movements and uh that subject .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	involve	[]	[]	[]
2160.96	That filter Mm yeah , filter out .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	filter	[]	[]	[Mm]
2185.86	To do .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2193.01	Watch out Well I think according to the latest documentation uh you're down for five percent of your fifteen months on this project or something .	EN2009b.C.words.xml	Watch	[fifteen months]	[]	[]
6.95	It kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background .	ES2002c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
144.55	Come on .	ES2002c.D.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
157.59	So um uh s move on .	ES2002c.D.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
199.16	And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision .	ES2002c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
209.14	Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project .	ES2002c.D.words.xml	initiate	[]	[]	[]
432.05	that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods , something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons .	ES2002c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Mac, iPods]
571.56	Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	light	[]	[]	[]
581.38	Anyway those are that's all I have , but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	revisit	[]	[]	[]
1371.73	Illuminate the buttons .	ES2002c.D.words.xml	Illuminate	[]	[]	[]
1562.26	I mean if we think of something , like I was saying also lime and lemon you know , what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series .	ES2002c.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1664.45	Um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1670.31	Can you like yeah just t we can visualize it .	ES2002c.D.words.xml	visualize	[]	[]	[]
1785.21	L.C. well I'd when you used to mention the L.C.D. I'd think I wonder what that would be about .	ES2002c.D.words.xml	think	[]	[L.C.]	[L.C.D.]
1943.36	Support for it .	ES2002c.D.words.xml	Support	[]	[]	[]
1971.18	So we should think about 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1997.15	And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small .	ES2002c.D.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[]
2311.16	Something a bit more flush , yeah , or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well , so that it has and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand .	ES2002c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
231.83	Like does it feel good , like yeah , physically .	ES2010d.D.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
305.18	Oh wait , that's false .	ES2010d.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
360.28	I'll give it a two .	ES2010d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
433.68	Well yeah , so I'd give it a two .	ES2010d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
453.0	So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , and uh hopefully we'll sell millions .	ES2010d.D.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[delicious]
909.62	Look at it .	ES2010d.D.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
917.37	Fashionable people will buy it .	ES2010d.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
920.79	Oh , I will create desire .	ES2010d.D.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
928.39	We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf .	ES2010d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Adam, Eve]
933.16	That'll sell .	ES2010d.D.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
182.76	Think I'll go first .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
367.31	But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	tend	[]	[]	[]
400.47	Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
433.79	Besides of course that the remote must look very nice .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
489.85	And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
496.55	So you'd know where it is in the room .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
498.9	And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	recharge	[]	[]	[]
528.06	This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
577.42	Yeah you should go to the top thingy .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
886.27	Well it would certainly make a fancy design .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
897.09	We would have to look into that .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1198.96	And new T.V.s will have internet access on them .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.s]
1303.15	They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1572.58	Think if you're gonna include teletext you do .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1610.89	And so you would need like 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1613.63	the T.V. would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1624.2	do have that .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1723.04	That would that would cost a a big marketing 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[]
1754.13	yeah I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1873.15	I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
1889.28	Which would tell you what it does .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1915.19	that would fit into the 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
2050.42	I'd have to look into that a little more .	TS3003b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2075.17	You could I think we n it would be a lot easier to 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
252.73	Yeah , yeah , you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
395.35	Um I have heard several things , so I uh I'll have to change that on the way .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
407.6	It should feel strong .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
411.2	We should move to uh something 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
427.5	But we'll return to that .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	return	[]	[]	[]
519.11	discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	define	[]	[]	[]
543.88	several examples of uh styles , so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
592.55	So to give you an idea of uh 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
620.28	Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
703.57	Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
716.29	Uh a more modern look not plain , long box style , but 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
723.26	I'll draw it , but maybe later .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
756.16	But we do use an L.C.D. screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1149.66	Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1192.73	I can live with it .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	live	[]	[]	[]
1297.27	I will design it , we design it later .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
1352.85	But uh we should decide now .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1435.55	And you can put that on and off , and switch it .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1476.39	According to my sources , uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1720.35	Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them , and and uh And uh 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1892.85	To make it as uh as round as possible .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1931.59	We we j we'll just give them an uh We'll design it , and then they can give comments on it .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1978.76	If there's enough space , you can put uh We'll we'll 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1999.01	But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2024.38	Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board , and you can remove the front .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	remove	[]	[]	[]
2057.19	I think it's a nice idea , to make it more recognisable , that the next to the logo you have the slogan .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2065.33	To make more uh of an impression .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2083.78	Or maybe here in the middle , but we'll decide later .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
2174.96	Maybe you can show it .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
2274.13	The high powers from above will have to tell us , yeah .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2286.99	We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2322.4	Bless you .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	Bless	[]	[]	[]
2401.16	the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , yeah .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[green, board]
2415.74	Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it uh 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2442.74	Guess so .	TS3009c.C.words.xml	Guess	[]	[]	[]
225.96	Um the red ones are for uh changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected .	ES2008d.C.words.xml	channel	[]	[]	[]
280.32	That'd work , yeah .	ES2008d.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
316.19	Let's pass .	ES2008d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
337.8	Um basically , in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
351.08	and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever .	ES2008d.C.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
538.42	Put an extra the button on .	ES2008d.C.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
774.93	I'll go for two .	ES2008d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
788.1	I think it's it's functional , it's also pretty basic , so I'll give it a two .	ES2008d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
924.12	Yeah I'd I'd give it a one .	ES2008d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1105.03	So I'd I'd give it a four .	ES2008d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1152.07	Um I'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah .	ES2008d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1187.81	I'll give it a two .	ES2008d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1331.05	Guess it's double-curved .	ES2008d.C.words.xml	Guess	[]	[]	[]
1814.79	Let's all let's all go for the yellow 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1818.2	Break the stem off .	ES2008d.C.words.xml	Break	[]	[]	[]
108.62	Do you want yeah , open .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
110.93	Read only .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	Read	[]	[]	[]
324.48	Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your your remote control .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	phone	[]	[]	[]
365.7	Well I'll check uh with my 	IS1006b.D.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
510.47	I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were had I think ten I think .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
540.36	That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
582.05	Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
629.31	I can go back .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1208.89	Go to channel twenty five .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1281.09	Well I could could uh have a look at that maybe .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1286.16	I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
1624.82	Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , and ha ha you cannot use my remote control , because it's targeted to me .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1845.7	We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1869.35	That's no problem , we will sell more .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
2074.66	You can clap .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	clap	[]	[]	[]
2111.0	Oh yeah , you do have .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2117.46	Think about it .	IS1006b.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
26.78	Uh welcome back after lunch , I hope uh you had a good lunch 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	welcome	[]	[]	[]
35.7	For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
89.29	little bit uh low , but I I hope we can finish it up so I'll handle to the 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	handle	[]	[]	[]
97.17	the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept .	IS1008c.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[Christine]
1223.46	Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh , countries like , uh , India yes , yes , countries like India or China or Malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more .	IS1008c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[India, India, China, Malaysia]	[]
1417.59	Yeah , so uh what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display .	IS1008c.A.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[Ed]
1430.57	So maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model .	IS1008c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1455.0	Yeah , I hope , if is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design , okay .	IS1008c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1460.5	Then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can uh submit to the I will submit to the management .	IS1008c.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
1468.49	Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display .	IS1008c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1481.32	how mu how much how much you can sell extra .	IS1008c.A.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
1484.32	Of course you'll make money too , so it 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1497.17	So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then uh , then we can proceed from there .	IS1008c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
372.18	Um well , I would th think that depends on how much money you give us .	IS1008a.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
377.74	Um because uh , you know , you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models .	IS1008a.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
402.66	Well , you know um , I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's uh very attractive that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own .	IS1008a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
423.78	So it would really would need to um something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , so um d uh you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool .	IS1008a.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[iPod]
447.86	Well , uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um and so I'll have to wait and see how those uh how those go .	IS1008a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
565.62	Okay , I'll get back to you on that .	IS1008a.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
97.06	Yes , and place some slides .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	place	[]	[]	[]
119.42	You can use it now by switching all these buttons .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
123.29	So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
153.52	s society will accept that .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	accept	[]	[]	[]
189.94	And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
200.7	Please press it .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
212.57	So you can touch it with your hands .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	touch	[]	[]	[]
243.35	You can have a look at it , and 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
406.84	So , r we'll start with L.C.D. .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	start	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
409.09	You can ask Bob .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[Bob]
460.29	Yeah , and we can just some strawberry first .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	strawberry	[]	[]	[]
479.38	Let's make a party first maybe .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
647.14	Feel the weight .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	Feel	[]	[]	[]
1052.26	Sure , sure , just look at it .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1058.64	Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1173.01	Check that number also .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	Check	[]	[]	[]
1416.41	Well , as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[eng]
1432.89	to make electricity .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1455.59	Let's do that .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1489.58	Let's have a look .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1775.2	So , we see , we can even forecast .	IS1006d.B.words.xml	forecast	[]	[]	[]
0.96	Wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	Wonder	[]	[]	[]
198.45	To just have the sort of main same sort of idiom throughout kinda .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[kinda]
231.88	Like if we wanna add more things in the future , then we have to well , new buttons .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
303.36	Yeah , but maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	tie	[]	[]	[]
378.44	Is that is that from any particular window , like if we wanna sorta get like if we were on the users versus like topic or something , have a right-click from for these various things to yeah .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
436.22	If you double-click on a particular topic or something , then it goes to sort of a like a default view , so it'll be like all the um cases of that topic , either whatever we decide the default to be , whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting , and just show up the the particular instances of that topic in a meeting .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
452.91	Like I'm just thinking to have the default there , so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do and we know that that's the most common thing that's gonna happen , so the double-click will do that and so save them the trouble of right-clicking and choosing the item on the menu .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
466.05	Well , it might come to us as we start playing with it .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
473.55	You'll have the menu , right-click it , but instead of like have a default double-click , so if there's a de so it'll be a choice from the menu but yeah , exactly .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
615.39	I think we probably need that , though to have the f the full flexibility , we need to have that there , but um yeah .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
762.19	Yeah , like a lot of these can be , like once we get the disfluencies out , then we can you know , have transcript without the disfluency , transcript with the disfluent disfluency .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
770.06	Have all these , you know , have all these sort of using the same window and so we can put a lot of and probably mutually um whate distinct , yeah .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
858.54	Yeah , so we can plug it in and 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	plug	[]	[]	[]
900.1	Or Like if we're gonna just try and like take a look or something , try and just plug some stuff I think you can if 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
907.32	Well , if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable , then we c know the directory to get in then and just 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
932.61	Or you could just email to us .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	email	[]	[]	[]
1023.57	So you could probably just use that code , like that was behind the question she asked him earlier .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1045.24	We'll probably still have to do some other file manage while , I don't know , creation .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1212.71	Yeah , I was thinking that we can probably get uh start attacking this seriously and then just um , yeah , hopefully have something by next week that we can sorta try integrating into the GUI .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	have	[next week]	[]	[GUI]
1225.04	Think that should be possible .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1508.39	I mean it's just , you know , play around with some extra stuff .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1576.52	Did we wanna meet before we talk to Steve next week .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	wanna	[next week]	[]	[Steve]
1584.34	We'll probably get some work done over the weekend , so I dunno if after D.N.L.G. or something , maybe just have a little quick little update and just 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	get	[the weekend]	[D.N.L.G.]	[]
1594.14	Well we can decide .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1600.37	Search .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	Search	[]	[]	[]
1616.69	Um like we can just decide sort of things that we do wanna do .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[wanna]
1647.31	Yeah , it'll get behind schedule , yeah , pretty quick .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1821.07	Like just get a a quick look over and just the basics .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1827.7	Like just just say okay , well here's you know , everything's basic in set-up and then just yeah , just jump right in .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	jump	[]	[]	[]
1848.62	Well thing is , you know , if yeah , something like that could happen anytime 'cause uh yeah , like my schedule's like a class , break , class , break , class , you know , that sort of thing .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	happen	[]	[]	[]
1912.6	W we well we can get in through the through the the card the card door .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1930.87	Just sort bang on it .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	bang	[]	[]	[]
1932.79	Actually I was asking Steve about that , whether we can get in there .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[Steve]
1955.37	That would come in handy , yeah .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1957.74	Hey , we could we could photo-copy our um assignment if we wanted to .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	copy	[]	[]	[]
2040.92	D.I.L. will probably have classes , yeah .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[D.I.L.]
2060.79	You can have it .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2089.6	But most will probably want to go with defaults .	EN2002a.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
193.92	'Kay guys , take it away .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[Kay]
415.43	Weemote .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	Weemote	[]	[]	[]
422.0	Wait what I w got in mind .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
469.21	Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
550.45	Uh , maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	develop	[]	[]	[]
556.88	They'll please the elder users as well .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	please	[]	[]	[]
859.88	Oh , okay , but 'kay , look .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1082.75	Save as .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
1093.8	do the the math .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1258.69	Okay , go on .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1259.75	Just go on .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1295.66	to sell .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
1346.85	Daniel , what do you think about Here .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[Daniel]
1349.82	What do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station just apart from the from the thing , so that you can uh put uh 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1460.54	But , wha 'Kay , look , what is the uh If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[Kay, Euro]
1474.47	does it have a lot of extra uh fun function more like 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1615.38	Go back .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1721.83	Uh , you could have but uh , it was your first , no uh no disrespect or something , but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1972.83	Go on .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
2075.71	And draw it , and it's it's placed over there .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2176.26	'Kay , double-click it .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[Kay]
2187.04	Double-click it .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
2258.76	Polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , maybe a a l a little application like uh uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2311.95	But , uh you can still discuss about it , but but click it in an application , that's a lot easier to process .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
2455.9	Yeah , but you can save it u the under another name .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
2515.24	Okay , go on .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2594.45	Our own people can make that , I think .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2667.13	Save it .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
2691.3	Oh wait .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
2692.32	Wait .	TS3007d.D.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
154.34	First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R.S.A. and then uh titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L.C.D. display .	IS1006c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[mm, R.S.A., L.C.D.]
187.64	And we can use some , moving kind of thing .	IS1006c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
260.88	Excuse me .	IS1006c.C.words.xml	Excuse	[]	[]	[]
294.82	Like you can have two curves .	IS1006c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
376.45	We'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .	IS1006c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
685.99	So maybe you can use in the end and 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
794.14	Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler .	IS1006c.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
799.37	Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	pay	[]	[]	[]
837.98	Just they'll get few more 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
988.74	Yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1094.79	So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah .	IS1006c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1557.61	We can have t colours or this shape or at least yeah .	IS1006c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1603.15	Look and feel de 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
1640.02	So , can we highlight the specific features of our yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's we want to follow general trend .	IS1006c.C.words.xml	highlight	[]	[]	[]
1666.42	So , do you think 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1718.53	Feature 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	Feature	[]	[]	[]
1746.17	Uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah .	IS1006c.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1753.88	Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1795.4	Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .	IS1006c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1827.49	Even design .	IS1006c.C.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
531.65	But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions .	TS3009d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Project, Manager]
842.68	Well , I should I think two , because the voice recorder is n not self learning .	TS3009d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1085.84	Yeah , you must change the chip uh back .	TS3009d.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1088.56	You must change the chip back , Nils .	TS3009d.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[Nils]
1185.53	Yeah or we could replace it 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	replace	[]	[]	[]
1252.76	Well , I do think so .	TS3009d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1257.75	feel .	TS3009d.B.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
1279.8	We can dump the special colour .	TS3009d.B.words.xml	dump	[]	[]	[]
1633.01	But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen .	TS3009d.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
1734.58	to email , yeah .	TS3009d.B.words.xml	email	[]	[]	[]
1843.58	Yeah , but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and uh 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1884.86	Yeah , we can go to the bar and uh with our newly earned money .	TS3009d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2009.89	Close your laptop .	TS3009d.B.words.xml	Close	[]	[]	[]
2021.56	Let's take this remote into uh production .	TS3009d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
185.28	'Kay , do you wanna open the 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[Kay]
206.23	I'll do the notes .	IS1008b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
256.58	um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth .	IS1008b.B.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
293.93	And um so it was highly directional flash light that uh you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels c so I think um those are still requirements we have today , uh fifty years later .	IS1008b.B.words.xml	change	[today, fifty years later]	[]	[]
313.6	And uh it was really a pioneering innovation , but it was uh sensitive to the sun , so that uh it would get would start off by the you'd get it would easily cause um problems .	IS1008b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
350.22	And um it would uh y you'd you could throw it at things if if the T.V. didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else .	IS1008b.B.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[T.V.]
404.42	I think um it could either be you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and um kind of blend in with things , so you didn't have to um uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user's home .	IS1008b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
470.09	Run over it with a car .	IS1008b.B.words.xml	Run	[]	[]	[]
931.35	So um might uh we can perhaps um do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost .	IS1008b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
973.6	so that uh y you know sen send power to it .	IS1008b.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[sen]
1161.52	Okay , we'll find that out .	IS1008b.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1670.09	You can object if you want to 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	object	[]	[]	[]
431.18	Um to start with these points .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
459.97	And in the end I'll um show you our target audience or our target product users , customers .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
540.68	Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
561.66	So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
680.24	So you can pick up and use it , than I think .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
705.38	Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
765.47	If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
802.48	Well I do think L.C.D. is more reachable than the speech recognition .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
807.52	So we might consider L.C.D. screens .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
828.62	to u uh to take this take these points into the notes .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	u	[]	[]	[]
892.7	Maybe you can select it .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
1091.99	Make them big , make them easy to uh to press .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1143.25	It's a f it's a new feature , you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1165.88	Right , continue .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	continue	[]	[]	[]
1390.22	We must have that .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1398.27	We can make a symbol of the company right here .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1472.78	So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
1518.77	Here , look at these numbers .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1533.33	So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
1542.42	So , I do think we have to uh have some features .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1610.01	So when you s you sit like this you can can watch .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	watch	[]	[]	[]
1678.2	We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1726.67	We'll draw two , and then we'll see uh 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1841.24	I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L.C.D. above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
1936.07	You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2063.08	Right , just make some decisions .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2078.82	I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2185.02	You do need the uh multi Or did uh No , like this one .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2237.2	I do think we have to put that underneath a clip .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2295.22	Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	zap	[]	[]	[]
2440.39	Get into my belly .	TS3009b.D.words.xml	Get	[]	[]	[]
381.8	So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found .	ES2016d.D.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
390.58	And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype .	ES2016d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
394.24	And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did .	ES2016d.D.words.xml	calculate	[]	[]	[]
422.68	And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that .	ES2016d.D.words.xml	achieve	[]	[]	[]
525.64	Um okay so , do you think , since we 	ES2016d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
921.49	pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically .	ES2016d.D.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
960.92	Yeah we'll go with that .	ES2016d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1165.0	It'd look really lovely .	ES2016d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1179.99	Leave it blank .	ES2016d.D.words.xml	Leave	[]	[]	[]
1509.57	We might have a while though .	ES2016d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
541.48	And the volume button will will become 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
703.07	And we all four could range 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	range	[]	[]	[]
707.49	could evaluate the 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
963.78	Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	Wha	[]	[]	[Europe]
1060.68	So yeah upload the 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	upload	[]	[]	[]
1083.09	would change your remote control for a n for a new one .	IS1004d.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1257.55	Do you want me to sum o I think it's not 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1509.55	Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here .	IS1004d.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1666.28	Would yeah , would buy .	IS1004d.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1678.65	Ah would buy , yeah .	IS1004d.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1144.85	And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , so just to take that weight into account .	ES2008c.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1164.29	And then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this .	ES2008c.D.words.xml	whi	[]	[]	[]
1235.84	Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most .	ES2008c.D.words.xml	reverse	[]	[]	[]
1377.88	Just to tie it in a little .	ES2008c.D.words.xml	tie	[]	[]	[]
1484.91	Like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things , but then how you could go back to the menu and like , I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T.V. .	ES2008c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1501.45	And then you could still have that available .	ES2008c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1624.37	t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries .	ES2008c.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
531.82	And we would have one very big thing off-line .	EN2001a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
535.94	And from that we would just select what we are displaying .	EN2001a.B.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
542.85	So for example you would um give a high value to those um sequences you want to display in the meeting series summary .	EN2001a.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
3420.34	It it would have to be re-calculated only for my segments .	EN2001a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3461.39	So I would probably just concatenate all my um text chunks and then let's say m I will run over it .	EN2001a.B.words.xml	concatenate	[]	[]	[]
4300.15	And it would give you that .	EN2001a.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
4314.68	So I could just um contatenate concatenate um the words instead of the durations , and it should I mean 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	contatenate	[]	[]	[]
4334.26	I can try to do it and send it to you .	EN2001a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
4336.92	Pe and you have a look at it , will it make sense for what you want .	EN2001a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
4382.18	What do you mean by diffe 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[diffe]
4493.0	But I I mean as um the start uh start times um start for each meeting at zero , you could just probably just um add the um final second time to the next meeting and so on and just put it all together .	EN2001a.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
4512.2	But then we would have to change um the information about who on which channel it was set , um to by which person it was set .	EN2001a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
4562.52	So I would I mean I would just 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
4620.19	Yeah , I can directly put it into uh just like 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
4650.4	Yeah , they will just I will just take I would uh take over the names they have anyway .	EN2001a.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
4688.1	Yeah , and do you want 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
4827.05	So so um I will probably send um just one file of the first meeting um to all those who need it so that you can have a look whether that's what you want .	EN2001a.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
582.13	We can have a duck tape casing .	ES2009c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
590.6	It could go with the granola crowd .	ES2009c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[granola]
658.51	Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment .	ES2009c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1112.96	I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall .	ES2009c.C.words.xml	pass	[]	[]	[]
1652.77	Think then we're hitting our cost issue again .	ES2009c.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
161.79	Or you can put it in the shared folder .	IS1007a.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
208.76	Yeah I think assign your uh roles .	IS1007a.D.words.xml	assign	[]	[]	[]
568.28	And I could talk to the T.V. television itself .	IS1007a.D.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[T.V.]
774.37	Just plug it .	IS1007a.D.words.xml	plug	[]	[]	[]
353.55	Um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext , because that's sort of outdated with the internet , and according to to higher management the it should only control the T.V. , mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things , and they are concerned with the time to market .	IS1009b.A.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1550.7	And uh what function , working design , how how does it work .	IS1009b.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1710.54	And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at 	IS1009b.A.words.xml	afford	[]	[]	[]
1722.97	sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us 	IS1009b.A.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
1874.26	They have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , and maybe something like that , that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package .	IS1009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1900.4	And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately .	IS1009b.A.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1909.27	That's right , and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for a few uh Francs or Euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know .	IS1009b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Francs, Euros]
1994.52	If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that .	IS1009b.A.words.xml	address	[]	[]	[]
2004.74	Do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not .	IS1009b.A.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
2022.2	So hank you very much .	IS1009b.A.words.xml	hank	[]	[]	[]
373.91	We we might check with our R. and D. department to see if they have this product ready for market .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[R., D.]
565.43	So I can use the button , the mouse maybe .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
639.11	Mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L.C. display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L.C.D. screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[L.C.]	[Mm, mm, L.C.D.]
717.07	And then they also secure uh covers , to protect 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	protect	[]	[]	[]
768.62	So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
798.19	And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
805.06	And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , for example .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	beeps	[]	[]	[]
842.4	But you the see that in the V. , the V. appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow there's a V. like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	avoid	[]	[]	[V., V.]
865.49	Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
1044.01	Let's see the market demand .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1242.47	If you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the L.C.D. , after all the L.C.D. just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the L.C.D. , maybe even better .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[L.C.D.]	[L.C.D., L.C.D.]
1285.81	Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	Remember	[]	[]	[]
1303.76	Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1317.51	Ask our R. and D. department .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	Ask	[]	[]	[R., D.]
1326.08	And also the scroller button , how much will it cost .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[]
1568.4	Put it back at the charge .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
1603.22	That we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T.V. button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	charge	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1851.93	So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1860.79	Check with the v R. and D. department the capability of recogniser .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	Check	[]	[]	[R., D.]
1890.29	I I think that I have mm mm I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the T.V. screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1979.94	Yeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that .	IS1007c.B.words.xml	watch	[]	[]	[]
836.27	Go away .	TS3008c.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
846.55	Come on .	TS3008c.D.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
984.19	Yeah , the To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station .	TS3008c.D.words.xml	implement	[]	[]	[]
1048.42	So you you can put some fruity things 	TS3008c.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1091.91	Well , w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things .	TS3008c.D.words.xml	produce	[]	[]	[]
1166.49	If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here .	TS3008c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1188.78	I'll close 'em down .	TS3008c.D.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
1190.42	Um , go away .	TS3008c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1751.81	draw really nicely over there .	TS3008c.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1754.3	We can put the logo on our uh on our base station .	TS3008c.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1797.58	Just bring more designs on the market .	TS3008c.D.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
2170.57	Yeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever .	TS3008c.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2313.08	Construct one , yeah .	TS3008c.D.words.xml	Construct	[]	[]	[]
244.4	Have them in stock .	ES2007d.D.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
247.01	Make 'em more appealing as well .	ES2007d.D.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
331.97	Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , .	ES2007d.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
549.18	And the criterias are , and I'll draw this up on the board so we have a box 	ES2007d.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
574.46	to keep you informed .	ES2007d.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
585.5	Okay , first criteria , look and feel .	ES2007d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
604.4	So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one .	ES2007d.D.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
627.25	So we'll give it a 	ES2007d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
910.64	Just start summarising now .	ES2007d.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
914.26	You can reply to the same message .	ES2007d.D.words.xml	reply	[]	[]	[]
919.22	See summary , there .	ES2007d.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
155.59	Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
163.17	And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television .	IS1007b.C.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[]
174.65	So uh can you go one page down , please .	IS1007b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
206.89	Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like .	IS1007b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
219.73	And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that .	IS1007b.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
239.53	Okay so can you go down uh 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
243.04	So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the .	IS1007b.C.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[]
296.24	The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the T.V. set .	IS1007b.C.words.xml	transform	[]	[]	[qu, T.V.]
360.73	Well , th the F.P.G.A. will produce the the data to send .	IS1007b.C.words.xml	produce	[]	[F.P.G.A.]	[]
789.79	So , we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that .	IS1007b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
919.1	And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	allow	[]	[]	[]
1174.88	Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television .	IS1007b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1190.9	Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T.V. set that can access the internet .	IS1007b.C.words.xml	think	[a few years]	[]	[T.V.]
1224.38	Yeah , to desi well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible .	IS1007b.C.words.xml	desi	[]	[]	[]
244.28	But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um .	ES2009d.B.words.xml	slide	[]	[]	[]
271.18	Go ahead .	ES2009d.B.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
358.74	Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .	ES2009d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1275.22	And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit .	ES2009d.B.words.xml	prove	[]	[]	[Play, Doh]
1583.12	Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because 	ES2009d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2000.41	I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , like c come on gimme something .	ES2009d.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
336.67	Take Mozilla .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[Mozilla]
377.25	you know , w um what scope one annotation would have .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
641.33	No , their their annotation of dialogue acts , and one um segment can have or one um of those word strings that are presented in one line can have several um dialogue acts annotated on it .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
798.96	Um to discourse marker , DIS F. marker fi point five .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	discourse	[]	[]	[DIS, F.]
808.1	Go up .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
888.24	So we would perhaps have to make one that's similar .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1065.46	I think that is just the um things that are loaded every time , but we have lazy loading , so it can load more than that .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
1075.02	Perhaps we could just try to cope .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1080.13	make our file one of those lazy loaded .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1126.45	in the segments file it's really the very basic that have to be displayed for any thing .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	file	[]	[]	[]
1222.89	Um I always store the beg uh start and end time of everything I calculated there , so I would just have to pu put it uh yes .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[pu]
1375.72	It could contain end times and words for all speakers of all meetings .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	contain	[]	[]	[]
1868.81	But that would give the same value for one word every time I mean for for a specific word .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2493.14	But I could give um the information about , yeah , how how important this is to each of those segments .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2645.44	Yeah sure , but I could then if I if I have um the value for a segment , I would perhaps just give all the 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
2682.12	I would probably somehow have to break it down to to that level , yeah .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2711.92	Yeah , probably somehow it should work that way .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
3073.34	I'll probably look at it .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
3086.47	Yeah , but it could mess up things quite considerably .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	mess	[]	[]	[]
3416.74	Try uh try yeah .	EN2001b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
71.93	did you prepare .	IS1007d.A.words.xml	prepare	[]	[]	[]
1414.21	Because that's with L.C.D. just will increase the price , and I thi i they have the same rate so without L.C.D. it will be 	IS1007d.A.words.xml	increase	[]	[L.C.D.]	[L.C.D.]
1569.86	I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh 	IS1007d.A.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
1585.69	Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , so mayb better if you have all this in the same 	IS1007d.A.words.xml	forget	[]	[]	[]
469.79	And um and it should have multi-purpose .	IS1009a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
97.09	Okay , I'll start .	IS1005c.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
98.99	Can you open my presentation , please .	IS1005c.D.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
121.94	Can you pass the mouse , please .	IS1005c.D.words.xml	pass	[]	[]	[]
898.13	Can I ask a question .	IS1005c.D.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
939.09	You can cut the T.F.T. screen .	IS1005c.D.words.xml	cut	[]	[]	[T.F.T.]
1728.54	We could use Velcro .	IS1005c.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[Velcro]
169.33	Maybe you can uh point them uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
262.19	Yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh yes .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
362.84	Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
529.47	it could work , but 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
566.53	But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Real, Real, Reaction]
583.1	So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M.P. three players or or uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[M.P.]
595.34	Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
614.25	Yes , but we can make 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
624.05	No , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
630.57	When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	place	[]	[]	[]
640.87	Just have to be big enough for the biggest 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
660.4	But it's flat it's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
699.27	the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
747.1	Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
757.9	But , it will also uh uh use batteries , and do we want to 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
797.88	Yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , so it will uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
920.43	I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own yes , you can make it in your own uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1156.22	But still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone , with the with 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	retrieve	[]	[]	[]
1202.0	To put it on your head .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1275.23	Make it a two .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1277.55	When it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1513.26	The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip maybe .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[retriever]
1617.49	No , it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[]
1632.6	You can have f four kind of push-buttons .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1636.48	You can have uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1711.95	And then throw it 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
1731.53	They can handle that remote control , but but it isn't fo 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	handle	[]	[]	[]
1805.74	But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station yes .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
2039.94	I will put uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2176.49	We can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2403.89	wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	beep	[]	[]	[]
2422.91	Look at the case , the case the case of of uh of uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
2473.48	Maybe we can uh can do it both .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2475.5	Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2578.87	You can do it for fifty cents .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2738.17	Just fill that one in .	TS3008d.C.words.xml	fill	[]	[]	[]
567.63	So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people .	ES2009b.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
617.75	Need it back .	ES2009b.D.words.xml	Need	[]	[]	[]
752.47	That could work .	ES2009b.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
833.85	Go ahead .	ES2009b.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
851.3	'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have 	ES2009b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1334.55	Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary 	ES2009b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1363.45	Yeah you would think .	ES2009b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
40.76	So we are here for the functional design meeting mm so first I will show the agenda so 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
49.7	we will uh I will take notes during this meeting so 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
54.72	I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
63.19	so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	lead	[]	[]	[]
78.36	Then I will uh present you some new project requirements I received from uh the management board .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[]
89.03	Then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
96.77	and then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	assign	[]	[]	[]
122.04	You can start .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
370.06	Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
407.25	Maybe you can send it to me by email .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
411.75	Just to participant one .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	participant	[]	[]	[]
419.58	I will try to show it to everyone , that would be more comfortable .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
476.3	So maybe I can switch slides when you whenever you ask , that will be more convenient .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
609.97	Yeah but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a T.V. remote control according to new requirements I received from the management bo I will present them in the following .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	present	[]	[]	[T.V.]
644.45	To find it .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
802.66	To have L.C.D. and voice .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
914.4	uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1197.57	Okay so we can take this into account .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1279.24	Maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1298.14	Yeah I I will continue .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	continue	[]	[]	[]
1299.7	Well ask your question if you want .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1426.06	So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1542.02	We can discuss .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1590.48	So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	define	[]	[]	[]
1667.53	Maybe switch T.V. on and off 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1708.75	Maybe we can include that also .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
1781.21	Maybe we should have also a digit button 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1825.91	Maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1864.7	Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1868.08	So have a wheel for incremental , have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected , 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1884.07	And do we do we have a 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1947.8	And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	delay	[]	[]	[]
1973.77	So um I I will uh I will so I we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email I think but you can take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
2029.06	Uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
2047.62	So maybe this is better , to send it by email .	IS1001b.A.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
107.84	And go to that one .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
204.16	Um , then we'll move to the three presentations .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
731.0	And we'll turn to the next presentation .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
935.45	And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	exceed	[]	[]	[]
1001.93	Let's hear what Kate has to say .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[Kate]
1367.82	Um does it have to have a 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1531.7	It would have to sor store up the energy 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1535.16	and then use it .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1536.16	Solar can do that .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Solar]
1594.2	And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1630.68	I I s usually put more money than brains .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1764.29	Throw some light on that .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	Throw	[]	[]	[]
1797.78	Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	Enter	[]	[]	[]
1828.99	Then you'd have to have an off te off key .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1951.49	Come on .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
2011.49	Um will be completed q questionnaire , um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2032.84	um Kate to do the components , for 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Kate]
2037.75	you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Steph]
2044.15	Um and each of us will get help from our coach .	ES2013b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
6.79	The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic .	ES2005a.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
133.91	Uh , what do we think a 	ES2005a.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
144.4	'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily .	ES2005a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
214.12	Uh do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the hall in terms of security stuff if we can I mean my idea is to put the photocopier and the fax in the hall .	IB4001.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
317.0	And do we need a room like a reading room or Yeah .	IB4001.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
383.25	But at least deal with that particular situation and then see with the other , because I was thinking uh Gisella is quite , I mean , Gile Gisella's work is quite noisy , because it's secretary so , yeah , lot of phone call and stuff like that so Yeah , so you won't share an office with Gisella unless you are fifty per cent and not the fifty per cent Gisella is working , which is another condition .	IB4001.A.words.xml	deal	[]	[]	[Gisella, Gile, Gisella, Gisella, Gisella]
579.96	Yeah , but we will have this reading room , which can be 	IB4001.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
845.91	And leave a spare space for or 	IB4001.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
874.16	So for the reading room we will have a two person room .	IB4001.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
942.66	And stop reading .	IB4001.A.words.xml	stop	[]	[]	[]
1046.92	So we can exclude this one to make an office .	IB4001.A.words.xml	exclude	[]	[]	[]
1055.51	Or maybe write on the board , I don't know .	IB4001.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1183.12	So we can put Gisella in the two people room 	IB4001.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1235.17	No , but I think , if if the main , um how can I put that , the mm 	IB4001.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1248.37	If the main reason to put to to choose Gisella's place , is the proximity of the mailbox , it should be a two pe people room and not a three people room .	IB4001.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1517.86	So it does mean that the three piece room which is in the opposite of the northeast is the most sunny one .	IB4001.A.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1528.76	Let's say that .	IB4001.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1644.21	Bless you .	IB4001.A.words.xml	Bless	[]	[]	[]
1748.55	Save your file .	IB4001.A.words.xml	Save	[]	[]	[]
289.76	Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
399.5	And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
432.66	But to give him the shape of your hand , so you it's easier to use or something like that .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
444.57	I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
457.23	So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
461.78	Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[kinetic]
511.87	When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
526.0	Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
534.2	You can do it with your thumb .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
536.32	And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one , you can see channel one .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
543.32	The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
575.0	And the costs will increase a lot more .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
636.72	But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
653.79	Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
682.87	can provide our uh remote control .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	provide	[]	[]	[]
702.65	No , but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
780.51	I can uh look on my uh 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
795.24	Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	Note	[]	[]	[]
1125.61	You can do it with your thumb .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1148.34	If uh 'Kay c If we do If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Kay]
1166.38	And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
1301.59	Draw it .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	Draw	[]	[]	[]
1572.58	Uh , then you can also have like uh th um 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1577.07	Yeah , and joystick , I think .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	joystick	[]	[]	[]
1755.63	Then I'll uh make something up .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1855.38	Just use your thumb .	TS3010c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
78.93	We'll get round to that later .	ES2011a.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
401.49	So I'll use the spare one .	ES2011a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
580.19	And it well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .	ES2011a.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
757.78	But that would really make it more expensive .	ES2011a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
862.76	But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .	ES2011a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
945.27	Or some it i we can find out probably on the internet how much it's 	ES2011a.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
245.34	Okay , uh for for uh the noise sensitive table project um we decided to um to take the noise uh as input , and uh give a feedback uh with LEDs on the table .	IN1008.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1106.45	And after that uh if you have uh a cleaned curve and you can uh just apply uh functionally .	IN1008.A.words.xml	apply	[]	[]	[]
1114.08	And uh the second question was about um uh filtering and uh F.F.T. yeah , what you can get from it .	IN1008.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[F.F.T.]
1183.2	Uh o yes , I will just add something .	IN1008.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
1282.17	Sound related question .	IN1008.A.words.xml	Sound	[]	[]	[]
1305.44	Line in .	IN1008.A.words.xml	Line	[]	[]	[]
1448.8	Yes , to to have a better sound quality .	IN1008.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2339.9	And uh from from this kind of if information you can uh let's say have uh a finger print of the user to know uh if this is the same user speaking .	IN1008.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2440.64	Because uh perhaps uh person two will have uh some frequencies in the range of 	IN1008.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2457.56	And if you reconstruct the stream from this uh this range , you will uh get something uh that is uh 	IN1008.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2882.12	Enter uh when user is 	IN1008.A.words.xml	Enter	[]	[]	[]
3216.08	To have not uh very expensive tables .	IN1008.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3385.02	Let's have a break .	IN1008.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
48.22	Come on .	TS3004a.B.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
77.7	Let's just check one more time .	TS3004a.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
578.34	I can make a dog .	TS3004a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
844.0	Well we can try to make it special .	TS3004a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
940.48	Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[uniquer]
950.6	Fold open , where you can see uh more options .	TS3004a.B.words.xml	Fold	[]	[]	[]
977.96	No you can make an uh manual in it .	TS3004a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1078.09	Maybe uh use it as a separate option .	TS3004a.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1081.13	Sell it uh separately .	TS3004a.B.words.xml	Sell	[]	[]	[]
1122.26	Well I think we have to look at that , 'cause well you can do the standard way , but then you won't 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1276.93	What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control .	TS3004a.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1292.85	folder about it .	TS3004a.B.words.xml	folder	[]	[]	[]
181.0	Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator .	ES2011c.B.words.xml	protect	[]	[]	[]
190.16	And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time .	ES2011c.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[desi, circuit, board]
199.92	But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out .	ES2011c.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
225.19	Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium .	ES2011c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
229.14	Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy .	ES2011c.B.words.xml	recommend	[]	[]	[]
247.74	Uh , well we can use wood .	ES2011c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
251.22	Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip .	ES2011c.B.words.xml	note	[]	[]	[iPod]
1126.89	You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits .	ES2011c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1340.11	Yeah you could squish it .	ES2011c.B.words.xml	squish	[]	[]	[]
1412.0	You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand .	ES2011c.B.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
1415.32	Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again .	ES2011c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1537.71	Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap .	ES2011c.B.words.xml	produce	[]	[]	[]
89.41	Go ahead .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
402.51	It sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
418.2	We can do that .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
498.35	So this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1233.28	Or we could use a double-sided for less used functions you 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1369.67	I'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1454.07	Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1480.78	We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1508.68	press it on top .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
1771.57	Can can we save this or 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1820.56	Could you post some other essentials of what people want , so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	post	[]	[]	[]
1850.82	Well , I have your PowerPoint presentation , I can get some inf information out of that .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
1856.29	Let's see .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1885.05	Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , I can draw out some ideas .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
1898.22	I can put the other buttons in 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1925.23	Yes , but it should cover all the functions , so possibly , just an idea that popped in 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	cover	[]	[]	[]
1945.34	Yeah , but we could go a step further , because some T.V.s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[T.V.s]
2105.82	To make it kind of futuristic .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2280.14	Yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , because it's basically the most important function .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
2292.25	Well , that would make them quite small .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2295.4	So maybe you'd put them here .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2375.31	Let's see what we have here .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2419.25	Yes , go and finish up and I'll see you at lunch .	TS3012b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
7.05	No on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
51.33	We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
56.81	we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
61.01	We introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T.V. a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	joystick	[]	[]	[T.V.]
135.12	Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	crack	[]	[]	[]
139.98	Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first , to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert]
147.35	So um I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
515.62	If you could uh speed it up a bit please , yeah .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	speed	[]	[]	[]
795.76	Um , if we could hear from our Industrial engineer , or Designer .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	hear	[]	[Industrial]	[]
810.1	If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder , or project documents .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
816.59	If you save it in there we can open it up from here .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
1025.55	Um , right we can probably skip that for now .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
1060.67	The power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	cause	[]	[]	[]
1070.28	Um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice , I.B.M. do um drag and dictate , but these require a lot of memory and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	drag	[]	[]	[I.B.M.]
1128.91	Well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone , something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[evr]
1155.84	Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1214.57	I would agree with you .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1288.23	But that does cover a very large section of the people out there .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	cover	[]	[]	[]
1314.68	Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , it depends , I mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1338.53	So that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still know what do do .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1342.74	And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the T.V. and who would normally use the unit .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	ignore	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1470.11	So I can understand your point , and I would agree with you , but this is our design spec for now .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
1502.95	And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1507.15	Maybe we'll hear differently , but for now 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	hear	[]	[]	[]
1617.59	Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	beep	[]	[]	[]
1627.86	And that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T.V. , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't power that might be something that we could look into .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	watch	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1663.4	To go on from here .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1678.59	Do we go for maybe a remote contro uh sorry , we're gonna go for a remote control obviously , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L.C.D. .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1702.02	We could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume , and 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1833.49	So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T.V. , just so that it says find me , and what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	require	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1858.42	E us we might be better with the sound possibly we could maybe incorporate 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
1864.85	th e the true fact , considering the cost of an L.E.D. , we could just incorporate it anyway .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
1877.86	So by the sounds of it , with what we're suggesting so far , your design um the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1891.64	you know a small L.C.D. , joystick , e I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	joystick	[]	[L.C.D.]	[joystick]
1967.0	Feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible .	ES2003b.B.words.xml	Feel	[]	[]	[wanna]
46.23	Do you reckon this stands for lambda or yeah , okay .	EN2006b.D.words.xml	reckon	[]	[]	[]
792.26	And give it an acronym .	EN2006b.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
894.0	get this out of the way .	EN2006b.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1154.04	Wait , fr from the linguistic side , if you if you mark star burst before and if you feel that star bursts are like objects , then I think it sh it should stay in in this case , even though it's modified by activity , or it's it's m modifying activity actually .	EN2006b.D.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[fr, star]
1679.36	Mark the la la .	EN2006b.D.words.xml	Mark	[]	[]	[]
1680.29	Mark the whole string as one entity .	EN2006b.D.words.xml	Mark	[]	[]	[]
915.05	You can train after that uh an S.V.M. , saying this is category one or two on the label document , and then we will have an unlabelled document and you just say this is directory one or two .	IN1005.D.words.xml	train	[]	[]	[S.V.M.]
1208.93	You can e even keep the bag of words and do the cosine comparison or 	IN1005.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1270.38	Yeah , just know where .	IN1005.D.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
2762.4	We should wait .	IN1005.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
451.83	Okay , you should press next .	TS3012a.C.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
156.83	I will make this quick , since we don't have much time .	ES2003a.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
266.0	Oh that's good , we can clip them on .	ES2003a.C.words.xml	clip	[]	[]	[]
910.0	They they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things .	ES2003a.C.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[]
917.64	Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , and slide another bar to say what time it ends , you know that's 	ES2003a.C.words.xml	slide	[]	[]	[]
937.79	I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot .	ES2003a.C.words.xml	shoot	[]	[]	[]
76.61	And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .	TS3010d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[joystick]
82.01	So , you can still operate uh all the things .	TS3010d.B.words.xml	operate	[]	[]	[]
87.96	And then it can break .	TS3010d.B.words.xml	break	[]	[]	[]
552.19	Then make it th three .	TS3010d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
156.976	Could you just plug it back into hers because she had oh .	ES2011b.C.words.xml	plug	[]	[]	[]
352.15	So get this .	ES2011b.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
478.77	do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T.V. .	ES2011b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[T.V.]
521.54	Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user .	ES2011b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
756.34	Do you know about like I dunno , you seem like you know about 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
993.36	Make it fashionable .	ES2011b.C.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1030.9	Then it can live anywhere .	ES2011b.C.words.xml	live	[]	[]	[]
1291.52	So volume could be like the top it and the bottom So do you need to okay .	ES2011b.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1317.5	But then so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1338.35	So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want .	ES2011b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1346.84	Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down .	ES2011b.C.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
1425.3	Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1473.68	So how do you switch 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
1500.88	So you'd have to have like I think you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can you're either on T.V. , you're on D.V.D. or you're on V.C.R. , or you're like .	ES2011b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V., V.C.R.]
111.37	Let me just tell us so what you know already about uh , I don't know , how far you are with the s features .	IN1007.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
778.08	Because you can choose which filters you want , more less , or just trajectories of those bands .	IN1007.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
813.64	And more or less you can divide this into a Hilbert envelope , Hilb Hilbert carrier .	IN1007.B.words.xml	divide	[]	[]	[Hilbert, Hilb, Hilbert]
845.68	You can compress the spectrum somehow in in such a way that you rather um preserve those even also those dips , not only peaks in the spectrum .	IN1007.B.words.xml	compress	[]	[]	[]
965.2	We can go down till like twelve and still okay I would say .	IN1007.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
973.13	Once you can go down with frequency bands , then you will have much uh more c uh complicated data .	IN1007.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1133.3	And this is what you also have to somehow transmit , or at least try to transmit in order to get 	IN1007.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1211.14	So then you can transmit uh just fe 	IN1007.B.words.xml	transmit	[]	[]	[]
1372.08	You can model it better .	IN1007.B.words.xml	model	[]	[]	[]
1433.89	Yeah , you just preserve something different little bit .	IN1007.B.words.xml	preserve	[]	[]	[]
1436.5	Let's say in R.S.S. .	IN1007.B.words.xml	Let	[R.S.S.]	[]	[]
2050.73	Just maybe to hear something new .	IN1007.B.words.xml	hear	[]	[]	[]
386.96	Make it .	TS3010b.D.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1141.59	And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I I think the younger will be most interest in it .	TS3010b.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1161.23	If you have an L.C.D. on the remote control , what would you think of it .	TS3010b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1261.19	But less of them will buy it .	TS3010b.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1284.65	And um we can make special features .	TS3010b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1291.8	But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition .	TS3010b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1311.23	You can find most functions on a T.V. set .	TS3010b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1543.78	The the requirements you just said , maybe we should first have a discussion about that .	TS3010b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1736.74	I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows .	TS3010b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1749.97	And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons .	TS3010b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1754.88	But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .	TS3010b.D.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
1792.0	But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um 	TS3010b.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1807.73	And also to find the easy to use uh part very important .	TS3010b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
731.03	Um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , um so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
749.84	Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the L.C.D. , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[joystick, L.C.D.]
809.42	You must have two two modes , basic mode , where um the joystick's uh left right left right for channels , up down for volume , um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[joystick]
906.74	I can add pretty pictures to this .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
913.98	Assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position , um hol uh holding the remote , the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	rest	[]	[]	[joystick]
933.44	Um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
975.84	Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
982.31	And you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the L.C.D. , and this would need to be articulated as well .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
989.7	And basically I'd want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
994.08	So it would fit just nicely in the hand .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1057.41	And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T.V.s from all sort of main manufacturers .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	download	[]	[]	[T.V.s]
1454.31	But if you h but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure , then you can sub-group them .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	sub	[]	[]	[]
1593.52	Make it harder to lose , as well .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1647.8	Well basi basically the um for f for uh I mean e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the T.V. responds to .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1665.01	usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote , and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer and try the different codes that 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[ma]
1685.62	come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1700.51	But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	avoid	[]	[]	[]
2086.23	The other thing I mean it I mean it would need to ha it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2203.99	I having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea , though maybe we could have options for colours as well .	ES2003c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
188.01	Uh yeah , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on .	ES2013a.B.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
233.77	Only animal I could thin I could draw .	ES2013a.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
245.44	You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears .	ES2013a.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
264.09	In fact , I'll give it some more 	ES2013a.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
128.92	Uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but I have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon , so maybe you could hurry up a bit 	IS1001a.B.words.xml	hurry	[]	[]	[]
662.68	I it will look a bulky in that case .	IS1001a.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
31.58	Come on .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
88.86	Okay , go again .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
95.02	So , take you past the minutes of last meeting again .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
107.05	So then we'll just have to d uh have to go on , you know , the information that we have to make the make final decisions on uh on a conceptual design .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
154.01	And well actually we yeah , we did need some more data on finances , but w yeah we still don't have that apparently .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
176.38	Guess we'll have to do this after the after the you give your presentations .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Guess	[]	[]	[]
179.37	So I'll just close this one now , and let's uh let's see , .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
257.72	Also if if we were choose the the L.C.D. option , would it give enough energy Okay , that's the just assume it takes .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
314.77	Okay yeah , b you c of course you could place re re-chargeable batteries .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	place	[]	[]	[]
326.75	Okay , will just take regular batteries .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
347.01	Okay , we'll get back on that later .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
384.3	We'll just go uh 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
390.04	We'll discuss that later .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
395.87	We'll do that when y when you get your design .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
400.6	Well it it's stylish , but we can yeah , but you can change your covers anyway .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
419.31	But Continue .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Continue	[]	[]	[]
445.42	If it falls it might crack .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	crack	[]	[]	[]
460.7	If we wanna expand our options , f be fashionable , then we can get changeable covers .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
528.76	I mean it for volume control it's it's a smoother motion , you can just increase or decrease .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
600.94	Oh let's go for let's say because it is uh very hot in n our target group I think , we should take it take it t to consideration to build an L.C.D. screen in it .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
625.81	We'll pick a we'll pick from uh we'll just combine everything later .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
647.5	Once again I was would ask you if it's expensive , but apparently you don't have any data .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
659.02	So we can implement it .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	implement	[]	[]	[]
738.21	Yeah , hold on a minute .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
749.47	Okay , so uh just just go for design for now .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
751.57	Just m have a seat for a second .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
756.66	We'll combine everything after this .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	combine	[]	[]	[]
794.3	Or Okay , so just yeah , you can rest it on your finger .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	rest	[]	[]	[]
844.78	Well , you can work on the actual concept or actual design later with him .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
892.64	Yeah , uh or for example , why did you pick the mm the numbers uh all the way below , and the and the channels and volume control 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
958.67	No , you should send it to the f to the folder first .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1083.87	Let's just go 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1158.09	Or maybe just make it make it up into into a low a smooth curve instead of just less sharp twist on the outside .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1192.52	One cur you could also make the curve go through of course .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1195.23	But that would make make the top round .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1215.06	But let's see , titanium would give us only one curve .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1227.76	Just doodle something on the board on the left .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	doodle	[]	[]	[]
1270.68	um decrease the the um the size the electronics that can be inside .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	decrease	[]	[]	[]
1352.38	So So we decided on what what did you guys wanna know again because this is um anyway , I'll fire up my thing .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	fire	[]	[]	[wanna]
1397.29	The case , it will be the material will be rubber , suppose .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	suppose	[]	[]	[]
1417.53	Anyway , um apparently you guys , you should work together on the final design , both on internal and external design .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1429.33	Yeah , you should you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market , how uh what's gonna happen with the final design as we have it now .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1442.23	So Wanna spend some more um I think we're in a pretty much in agreement actually , which is good .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[Wanna]
1459.79	Yeah uh open your thing again .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
1460.96	Let's see what if you can come up with anything new .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1463.92	Um I'll just do a next one .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1540.33	Let's see , I'll just make 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1547.25	And just make it red now .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1562.62	Personally I would prefer round ones .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
1616.4	For example , if you let's see , put it this here .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1637.58	So do you want for example a 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1658.48	We'll just take the take the round button , suppose .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1685.65	Think we need an extra button here of course for yeah , like you had for the 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1694.85	And you could include a button here for the mute , I suppose .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
1721.74	We could put a logo here because it's very always in your field of vision .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1732.69	Well we could we could include either here 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
1747.71	No , we could put this one as favourite channel for exam 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1770.83	My uh okay , have it your way .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1772.13	I mean , think this looks rather like like there's something missing for example .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1785.25	Let's say I mean could be anything .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1834.73	Let's keep it at this .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1840.68	Do we want something interesting with it or see .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1845.16	Would give us a light here .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1855.03	Will give us design problem because we have 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1901.32	Stop the curve here or continue it 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Stop	[]	[]	[]
1909.34	Let's see .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1920.0	So you have your L.C.D. screen right here , suppose .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	suppose	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1930.08	Um that would make 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1952.26	So it would give the buttons here .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1980.69	Let's 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1984.58	I think it's the best place yeah , you could also put 'em here .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2087.32	I mean it could be a all this stuff could be integrated into the L.C.D. screen , which you could navigate with this , I suppose .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	navigate	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
2092.51	Navigate through everything .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Navigate	[]	[]	[]
2103.51	You can just navigate through th m your menu that you have here for advanced options with this .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	navigate	[]	[]	[]
2108.53	Think that would be fine .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
2126.13	We could Yeah , but you could put a speaker or something on on the side for example .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2196.13	And yeah , of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2243.03	Take what you c yellow remote control .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
2351.1	You can make rubber in any colour .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2362.06	Uh yeah we can make uh for example it's just something you can click on it like uh that's but it's not som not apparently that's not something we're working with in the basic design .	TS3012c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
76.5	Let's see .	ES2011d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
121.45	Yeah um f you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
250.76	Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet .	ES2011d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[Excel]
348.99	Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit .	ES2011d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
392.96	Do you wanna 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
579.39	Um we can do it separately and then discuss it if if that's what people wanna do .	ES2011d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
592.33	Wait , one is true and so these are the questions we're answering .	ES2011d.A.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
880.0	So we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1215.94	Or I mean we could even have fruit like around I mean 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1303.99	And you could like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part .	ES2011d.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1420.71	And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular .	ES2011d.A.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[]
1488.17	Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
43.85	Do you know them or 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
160.79	And show , sorry .	TS3004b.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
198.55	look at .	TS3004b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
229.75	So yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
386.0	Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top , then you're you're 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
518.5	So yeah , so we just can skip the L.C.D. r on the remote control , because 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	skip	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
649.13	So Paul , you can do the next one if you want .	TS3004b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Paul]
697.08	So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
918.08	Normally you can press one , zero or 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
1040.4	You'll also have to use a mute button to to 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1086.79	Does it have to be Uh it has to be uh with different colours or 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1097.78	Just to make it 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1300.83	If we can still make that then 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1533.86	So we can make the normal one also a normal light .	TS3004b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1539.88	To flash up your 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	flash	[]	[]	[]
1800.8	The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty .	TS3004b.A.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
1956.95	We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy .	TS3004b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2039.26	Or you can switch it on or something .	TS3004b.A.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
2055.23	Like a iMac , if you can look through it .	TS3004b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[iMac]
2086.91	Yeah , maybe you have you have to Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one .	TS3004b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2101.7	O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control .	TS3004b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
127.46	So does anyone have any uh thoughts 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
181.72	to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
259.42	Try out whiteboard .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
282.21	Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	wish	[]	[]	[]
291.89	But now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
299.08	I would I would guess so .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	guess	[]	[]	[]
610.96	change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , so .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	change	[every couple of months]	[]	[]
691.94	from that to give you your profit margin per unit .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
696.93	And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	determine	[]	[]	[]
783.93	Use .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
814.12	Oh I w um basically I'll get back to you on that .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
910.04	And so these are probably mutually exclusive options that uh Hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more with handling them , therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1115.11	That's true , 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1132.75	So we will depart .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	depart	[]	[]	[]
1135.41	We will stay here and uh and break off .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
1139.45	And I'll do minutes and and we'll see you in half and hour .	ES2014a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
312.05	That'll spoil it .	IB4010.A.words.xml	spoil	[]	[]	[]
313.7	I'll tell you later .	IB4010.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
320.2	It's one of the freshest , funniest and scariest crime thrillers to come along since Pulp Fiction .	IB4010.A.words.xml	funniest	[]	[]	[Pulp, Fiction]
1086.42	Yeah , I mean if there's something that none of us like , we can just eliminate it , but we might as well leave everything 'till the end .	IB4010.A.words.xml	eliminate	[]	[]	[]
2497.64	Although I think you can mix I would keep the format of the first one , add the quotes and the content information from the second one .	IB4010.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
2507.14	So take those take those quotes , get rid of that section of text , put those quotes in there , put the the information you had in the second poster about the movie club , how to join , kind of in the middle and keep this title and everything just slightly higher up .	IB4010.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2559.8	Yeah , so take all of that content throw it up into the first one , and then maybe add the quotes that you had from the from the famous directors sort of at the bottom or something .	IB4010.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2786.82	Really eliminate Pulp Fiction .	IB4010.A.words.xml	eliminate	[]	[]	[Pulp, Fiction]
2854.22	It'll make a good change from the other ones .	IB4010.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
414.03	Excuse me .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	Excuse	[]	[]	[]
436.71	Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T.V. set .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[T.V.]
477.87	And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
523.15	So maybe we should consider that .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
554.63	It's been done many times before , and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	succeed	[]	[]	[]
593.21	And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	implement	[]	[]	[]
603.44	Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[board]
635.09	So we can use them .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
646.54	We can we can make its I think .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
684.31	Um have a think about it .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
828.14	Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
844.74	So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	concentrate	[]	[]	[]
884.05	You press it and your T.V. set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[T.V.]
898.84	No , so we we should use something else .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
913.34	S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , so we should think about 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
928.26	Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	separate	[]	[]	[]
988.74	And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , so w we should use have uh we should use something like that .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1152.44	Well , we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface and 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1199.06	You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1265.55	Well , maybe we can use a light for that .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1488.2	Change .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	Change	[]	[]	[]
1523.05	Mm okay , but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1573.79	Okay , I can imagine when 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1577.2	I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1584.49	But if you're uh a regular T.V. user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1635.56	Okay , so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	experiment	[]	[]	[]
1706.42	I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	manage	[]	[]	[]
1760.1	So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	expect	[]	[]	[]
1766.66	But maybe can we we can think something smart about it .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1789.1	I'll have to find that out .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1811.13	So it will cost us p practically nothing .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[]
1915.15	So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1970.19	If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
2145.57	Because I'll have some updated info on that uh 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2174.4	We can have the lunch .	TS3011b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
210.36	I'll go first .	ES2002b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
367.39	Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls .	ES2002b.C.words.xml	lack	[]	[]	[]
463.55	I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down .	ES2002b.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
529.84	Uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible .	ES2002b.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
548.23	There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers .	ES2002b.C.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
679.34	Just just switch them .	ES2002b.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
773.51	Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose .	ES2002b.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1405.84	Channel up .	ES2002b.C.words.xml	Channel	[]	[]	[]
274.0	Okay hang on .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[]
276.52	See if it's there .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
292.35	Hang on .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	Hang	[]	[]	[]
298.34	Either refresh it , or it sh Oh wait , maybe I didn't put it there .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	refresh	[]	[]	[]
302.28	Hang on .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	Hang	[]	[]	[]
309.98	Sorry , hang on .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[]
391.99	So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
401.2	look into it , but Anyway , next .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
410.21	You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
466.77	Um it's very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
491.72	uh keep them away from other channels .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
837.46	Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before , and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
872.99	So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , or can it be altered in a certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1116.05	I would probably lean away from that .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	lean	[]	[]	[]
1285.41	And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	laugh	[]	[]	[]
1627.68	Well , hang on .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[]
1766.22	Ha hang on Let me catch up .	ES2010c.C.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[]
1014.47	I'll just try something else .	TS3003a.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
892.1	If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change .	ES2012b.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
965.02	But look at the importance of them .	ES2012b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1615.74	Um alright , yeah , so um I'll just do my presentation on the working design uh .	ES2012b.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1639.26	Um and it does this uh by well , you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television , the D.V.D. to tell that what to do .	ES2012b.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1673.3	Oh shoot .	ES2012b.B.words.xml	shoot	[]	[]	[]
1757.3	Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed .	ES2012b.B.words.xml	hit	[]	[]	[]
1764.98	Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily .	ES2012b.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1921.83	Yeah , think that's a good idea .	ES2012b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
170.71	Say a button's about say a button's about this size , right , so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
259.32	Excuse me .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	Excuse	[]	[]	[]
354.99	Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
373.4	Yep , left-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	determine	[]	[]	[]
437.87	Let me just confirm that .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
581.33	That will only save you one .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
590.86	do something on the T.V. , the T.V. responds and reacts as well , so the user could be looking at the T.V. and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T.V. to respond , which I think is a technically doable thing so 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V., T.V., T.V.]
668.08	We just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
777.91	So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add , and you might want to add in the report , length , width , and height .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
932.13	Maybe we should do the design evaluation first .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1111.14	Say it's more 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
1568.64	You feel like you're caged within whatever y It's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1574.8	The constraints do come in very fast .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1606.2	Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1680.15	Excuse me .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	Excuse	[]	[]	[]
2274.04	You can wear Homer , you can throw Homer when you're frustrated , doh .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	wear	[]	[]	[Homer]
2290.32	Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	learn	[]	[]	[Play, Doh]
2309.24	You might wanna write that down .	ES2002d.A.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
326.774	Okay , we'll we'll come to that later .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
352.094	M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
454.42400000000004	the then we'll switch to my presentation .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
530.034	to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Euro]
650.284	Maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
683.054	Although I think we yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
743.684	Um but we can evaluate the process and um uh 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
773.794	We l we can learn .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	learn	[]	[]	[]
814.784	No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1033.5639999999999	I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	apply	[]	[]	[]
1236.134	I'll give it a one .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1348.0639999999999	enter any comment you like , as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	enter	[]	[]	[]
1390.974	I'll give it uh a one .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1458.094	Maybe we should have a radar uh function .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1545.264	Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1566.3239999999998	What did you think about uh 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1585.914	Try to translate that .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
1793.144	To digitise them .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	digitise	[]	[]	[]
1871.734	Or the other way around , that you could show but m 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
1994.014	get an email .	TS3011d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2016.174	redesign our uh 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	redesign	[]	[]	[]
206.35	And we can start meeting .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
225.35	So first uh just to mention I will 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	mention	[]	[]	[]
232.28	take notes uh of this meeting and uh I will try to work them out and give them to you .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
278.15	W We will uh in a minute we will uh start with them .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
290.29	Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
304.47	Uh Um about the functions and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
329.64	Think that's that's important matter .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
335.77	So And then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
362.6	Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
437.43	Yes , mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
682.52	we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Euro]
719.12	Do you have some more important facts or 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
750.48	Decline with age , mm .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	Decline	[]	[]	[]
758.17	We will talk about it later .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
820.73	Mm-hmm , y y you can move , uh .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
830.5	You can you can sa take my chair .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1129.48	So we we must adapt to the to the receiver .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	adapt	[]	[]	[]
1215.26	Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Matthew]
1582.04	Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects yes .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	Mean	[]	[]	[]
1676.35	So we should think about it um .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1680.3	Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
1732.06	Um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty , 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	need	[the age of forty]	[]	[]
1758.82	So that's to that's I mean there's a market but uh they will grow older older and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	grow	[]	[]	[al]
1781.89	make our our our R.C. as trendy as possible but 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[R.C.]	[]
1786.23	it should also be uh have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1834.63	Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[Ma]
1943.14	Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2084.29	S so we can try to go in between , and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2282.69	W yes , we uh we can have lunch now .	IS1000b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
77.08	Um but first I'll show you the agenda .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
156.11	And maybe we can uh work it out .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1087.73	So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
1093.69	Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	introduce	[]	[]	[]
1116.26	And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1144.38	Go ahead .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1268.89	Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[signifi]
1293.49	So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1357.23	Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
1417.83	Change the cases .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	Change	[]	[]	[]
1432.61	You can sell the cases .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
1437.94	Because um then you can advertise as well with the Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	advertise	[]	[]	[]
1457.96	So and then you can make them with colour .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1488.93	on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	apply	[]	[]	[]
1589.91	And you can just yeah then click it in .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1601.88	Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1611.44	Does somebody have ideas for a form or 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1713.49	So people can get confused .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1742.91	Let's see if I ca 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1855.66	make it a l a bit more fancy .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1947.09	Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2034.61	So get your mouse .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2063.39	If you can have this one , you turn it like this .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2065.92	And then flip it upside down .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	flip	[]	[]	[]
2125.09	Yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2175.12	So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2185.75	So check out the corporate website maybe .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
2208.54	So just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2218.6	And then we're going to uh try to finish our project , and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2242.33	And then you'll get a message .	TS3003c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2250.26	Then we can save this one in the 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
95.68	we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .	ES2004a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
101.93	Um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand .	ES2004a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
172.03	We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal .	ES2004a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[white, board]
188.83	Okay , I'll leave space for everyone else .	ES2004a.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
590.98	I think so , I think so , I'll be able to um pull it up , or I could put it in the shared folder or something .	ES2004a.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
816.15	Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .	ES2004a.B.words.xml	answer	[]	[]	[]
142.74	Keep going .	IN1014.D.words.xml	Keep	[]	[]	[]
727.27	Let's say that it makes uh less automatic in the sense that at point you need someone giving the file and putting the file upload in somewhere , et cetera .	IN1014.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[et]
1834.32	And maybe take the opportunity to look just a moment uh at what point we are and w when we plan basically to get something uh done and working .	IN1014.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1843.62	I can add to that list of project is something that Jean-Marc and me we have found in the literature .	IN1014.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[Jean, Marc]
2301.68	When we can expect to see 	IN1014.D.words.xml	expect	[]	[]	[]
2420.46	Do you think sp 	IN1014.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2501.46	But when do you expect to have the system ready to work uh working .	IN1014.D.words.xml	expect	[]	[]	[]
2591.65	Uh make something re that you are using very vague expression .	IN1014.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2594.61	Result , make something .	IN1014.D.words.xml	Result	[]	[]	[]
2597.44	Just just uh just tell me when it is ready .	IN1014.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
2766.27	We can try .	IN1014.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2766.88	I mean we can ask uh uh in the sense that if it is a priority for IDIAP so far we would get very good signals from that point of view , I I don't know .	IN1014.D.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[IDIAP]
2804.75	And if you think there are too many things that you risk to lose control , uh tell it now .	IN1014.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
2811.2	And we can try to say well we want to do it , but uh basically Mael and Olivier were the person mm-hmm .	IN1014.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[Mael, Olivier, mm]
2820.12	But but you can be involve in a different way .	IN1014.D.words.xml	involve	[]	[]	[]
2821.97	I mean you can eventually have uh a supervision role in the sense that you think that I I know how to do it , I like to do it , but I have no time .	IN1014.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2832.24	We can try to to ask .	IN1014.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
3014.8	We can ask , we can try to ask maybe if some person for six months so that your role is simply to help and advise .	IN1014.D.words.xml	ask	[six months]	[]	[]
3024.97	We can try to ask .	IN1014.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
3086.98	Let me pose again the question very clearly .	IN1014.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
3089.12	If I go to Herve , I can try and say we are in this situation apparently .	IN1014.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[Herve]
3108.29	Consider that it can be difficult of course to find them et cetera and so on .	IN1014.D.words.xml	Consider	[]	[]	[]
3158.97	We will find the time however .	IN1014.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
3161.25	So April O. six you will have your system .	IN1014.D.words.xml	have	[April O. six]	[]	[]
3167.47	Uh it can happen that we don't .	IN1014.D.words.xml	happen	[]	[]	[]
3176.59	Uh maybe we will s we wi will not able to be continuous .	IN1014.D.words.xml	s	[]	[]	[]
3198.37	It can be you that basically follow , advise , helps .	IN1014.D.words.xml	advise	[]	[]	[]
3223.07	Forget about everything else and go with that .	IN1014.D.words.xml	Forget	[]	[]	[]
3226.93	Or will tell you okay , uh January two thousand six , but from January two thousand six you do nothing else than this .	IN1014.D.words.xml	tell	[January two thousand six, January two thousand six]	[]	[]
3233.67	You know , w we can find the time , whether it is your time , whether it is the time of someone else .	IN1014.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
3257.45	But but uh otherwise I mean , as you say , to do it in two years p 	IN1014.D.words.xml	do	[two years p]	[]	[]
3520.7	Let me 	IN1014.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
3579.81	Just to go to a conclusion , because apparently yeah .	IN1014.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
3611.24	And then we d make a decision in the sense whether you continue working or we try to find the time in a different way or we try to eliminate your other priorities you're under .	IN1014.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
3654.77	Try to have that because uh I cannot say we have tried to have 	IN1014.D.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
135.78	nice to stock you know , stick your finger in .	ES2010d.B.words.xml	stick	[]	[]	[]
139.13	Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side .	ES2010d.B.words.xml	mute	[]	[]	[]
323.08	I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way .	ES2010d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
388.22	We could do it with the chip , yes .	ES2010d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
604.63	But we just have push 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
623.92	Let's call it th 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
653.83	So we can go to production .	ES2010d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
701.27	Go back .	ES2010d.B.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
871.64	The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids .	ES2010d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[Toronto]	[Macs]
921.99	We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met .	ES2010d.B.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
925.65	This will help them find the one .	ES2010d.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
934.56	And so the serpent says , use our remote .	ES2010d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
676.08	Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are .	TS3003b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
686.65	Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button .	TS3003b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
701.83	Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device .	TS3003b.B.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
744.38	So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D.V.D. player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh .	TS3003b.B.words.xml	reverse	[]	[]	[]
803.95	We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah .	TS3003b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
816.64	So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large .	TS3003b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1562.51	So we can s we can skip the display , so uh we don't need it .	TS3003b.B.words.xml	s	[]	[]	[]
522.47	Yeah , you can start it you know .	IS1000a.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
528.85	No they will record through that .	IS1000a.C.words.xml	record	[]	[]	[]
680.79	Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that .	IS1000a.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
796.94	I'll tell to get it off my 	IS1000a.C.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1028.48	You should go for the next one it seems to me .	IS1000a.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1195.54	Of course it should have a on off button .	IS1000a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1208.93	You might need uh 	IS1000a.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1295.62	you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then you uh Today we have uh um teletext and all those things .	IS1000a.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1309.85	Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so 	IS1000a.C.words.xml	have	[Tomorrow]	[]	[]
1342.11	Let's Let's take 	IS1000a.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1400.45	Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know , you you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know .	IS1000a.C.words.xml	hook	[]	[]	[]
36.45	Yeah , we'll go we've got the mailing lists out now , isn't isn't it .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
68.64	Yeah , with the yeah , I mean I di I di I did do hard dri hard drive check um and a memory check , and it says there's no uh there's no problems , but something caused it to go wrong in the first place .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[dri]
105.82	One we'll try and get done today , yeah , get get Windows back on there .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	try	[today]	[]	[Windows]
108.42	Try and get Camtasia on there and get that tested out , and then that will be I think that's everything we need f before we can before you can start running the experiments , isn't it .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	Try	[]	[Camtasia]	[]
185.95	Um so my m I should get everything working on the um , yeah , on Monday , so sure that the J.C.T. is actually working , collaborating collaborating between the two machines .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	get	[Monday]	[]	[J.C.T.]
305.71	Yeah , so I'll try and try and get Camtasia up and running so I can try it out when when when we've got her coming in .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[Camtasia]	[]
311.06	And we'll just sort of do a run-through of proper pilot just to just just so I can see th 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
320.68	Um yeah , I'll make sure make sure they can actually pick up the f um audio signal as well .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
330.62	So that should that should make that slightly easier .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
359.43	So so just change sound to whatever you like , just go through the Windows control panel .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Windows]
368.52	Yep , yeah so I'll I'll have that running over the weekend .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	have	[the weekend]	[]	[]
378.81	Did it with ten kilo-hertz and it's just really clear , where you can tell exactly where exactly where the beep is now .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
384.54	So tha it's ju just a matter of um yeah , you just ba basically just play it , just play a ten kilo-hertz sound over the over the speech and then just um compare the two signals basically .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[ba]
415.98	Yep , yeah , the the one the one in just installed should have that now .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
418.92	Um we'll double we'll double-check and re-install on software on the on the um eye tracking machines .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	double	[]	[]	[]
461.34	And if it ever ever gets to be a problem in the pilot I can easily reduce the size of whatever .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	reduce	[]	[]	[]
508.72	Uh I'll try it .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
631.91	So so you can you can do it in X. fig , export them as S.V.G. , and you just get a you just get a list of X.Y. coordinates .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[X., X.Y.]	[S.V.G.]
637.98	Um and then I'll just write in a little script that turns those X.Y. coordinates into a part .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	write	[]	[X.Y.]	[]
655.64	So I'll als I'll also have a look have a look at that .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
681.55	Have a feeling that that can actually edit S.V.G. files .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[S.V.G.]
750.21	Um when will yeah but no I'll I'll create a c I'll create a convex part um just so next week um ju yeah , but it just it it just just happened to be a convex part that I was that I was I was playing with .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	create	[next week]	[]	[]
763.25	So I'll just have to have check that .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
814.98	Yeah , so for now we'll just just assume that non-interse non-intersecting um and um yeah , and then there's this at the moment the e the S.V.G. stuff can output ones which aren't closed polygons .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	assume	[]	[]	[S.V.G.]
841.99	So um but yeah , suppose let Nijmegen uh find their find their own S.V.G. , sort of find something that does S.V.G. and then we'll see if there's any problems .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	suppose	[]	[]	[Nijmegen, S.V.G., S.V.G.]
1028.75	Copy and paste the stuff out the off off the Wiki .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	Copy	[]	[]	[Wiki]
1193.84	So just put a start and end time on each part .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1387.86	Well uh well I kn I know on Camtasia , if you got a ca if you've got a Camtasia project , you can have the video and audio stored separately .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[Camtasia, Camtasia]	[]
1401.0	And then they can easy create their audio out of mm from that outp 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
1474.05	Well one thing uh one one thing that Camtasia can do , you can have little videos when other haven't gotten got any cameras for doing that .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[Camtasia]	[]
1479.46	But you could like have videos of people click on the mouses and sorta or whatever else , mm-hmm .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[sorta, mm]
1498.65	You can do yeah , you can generate call-outs and whatever .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1813.36	Um so what I'm gonna do is actually create an output uh a G.D.F. output part to it .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[G.D.F.]
1820.53	Um but it does have internal structures will just make it easy to do the the X.M.L. .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[X.M.L.]
2023.02	And I'll t uh yeah , I'll get get working on the Camtasia stuff this week and then so once uh once uh once we've got some some idea about what analysis you want out of this , I can think about whether G.D.F.'s got everything we need in it .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	t	[this week]	[Camtasia]	[G.D.F.]
2032.87	Um and f yeah , what analysis we can pull out of it .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	pull	[]	[]	[]
2039.93	So I'll I'll double-check the G.D.F. specification against that just to make sure it's got everything you said that you'd you say you need from that list .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[G.D.F.]
2088.26	Yeah , 'cause they I mean we w we got all this in the ASCII format at the moment and it's just a matter of what data do we need to pull out of that into the G.D.F. so I can actually do the proper analysis .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[G.D.F.]
2137.44	And then yeah , yeah , and then on top of that G.D.F. can also it will also have information such as , right , at this point in time they were looking at the new parts area or they were looking at the target .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[G.D.F.]
2153.56	And then also 'cause it's X.M.L. file , we can then do X.S.L.T. or whatever on to it to get extract whatever bits of data you need for yeah , for for whichever bits of analysis you're trying to do from it .	EN2009b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[X.S.L.T.]	[X.M.L.]
408.82	Or we could make oh .	TS3011c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
616.29	But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control .	TS3011c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
684.29	Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface .	TS3011c.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[Ruud]
711.96	So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty uh um 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	programme	[]	[]	[]
1037.57	Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .	TS3011c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1083.77	think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1461.75	And I would think 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1615.34	Think so too .	TS3011c.B.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1900.77	But you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button .	TS3011c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1952.85	Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print , with and uh 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	print	[Just a week ago]	[]	[]
2018.87	Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons .	TS3011c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2044.98	What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .	TS3011c.B.words.xml	disappear	[]	[]	[]
2159.14	Y uh can you separate these uh these 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	separate	[]	[]	[]
2246.37	Use with .	TS3011c.B.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
952.58	Like the face-plates that you change so we could have maybe I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , where you can change the face-plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different different things .	ES2012a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
965.93	Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that , probably just plastic because that's always the lightest .	ES2012a.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
65.38	Um so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
84.25	Um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
117.11	Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
239.91	Aye a fair point definitely .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	Aye	[]	[]	[]
307.62	Aye right .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	Aye	[]	[]	[]
592.36	Uh Craig do you wanna 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[Craig]
794.57	I think it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow , so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there , but keep going and we'll discuss it after .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
916.12	Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1166.42	I'll clear one of these things for you .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	clear	[]	[]	[]
1321.37	Yeah well yeah it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but yeah you c ask away .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1456.76	Um I mean what does everybody think about 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1479.62	So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1505.8	Um and when the corporate colour is yellow , I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow I don't know .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1606.96	It feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
1625.86	Well I'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or no I don't think we do either .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1703.76	So call it the snowman-shape trademark .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
1717.94	I mean do you want the whole thing yellow , maybe like yellow and white do you want something 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1769.78	Would we put that on the inside or 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1976.33	So you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea I'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as I thought .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2038.4	Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2056.02	S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	cur	[]	[]	[]
2267.71	Um and I'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible .	ES2002c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
196.88	Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[PowerPoints]
392.84	I can go .	ES2010b.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
395.72	Yeah , you should run it .	ES2010b.D.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[]
460.24	They like I guess use the buttons a lot .	ES2010b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
553.62	Yeah , I would assume so .	ES2010b.D.words.xml	assume	[]	[]	[]
595.05	Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is .	ES2010b.D.words.xml	tend	[]	[]	[]
632.5	And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it .	ES2010b.D.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[]
660.39	Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme .	ES2010b.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
891.49	We should make it glow in the dark .	ES2010b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1135.13	No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think .	ES2010b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1293.44	I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base .	ES2010b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1504.38	Wait .	ES2010b.D.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
1515.68	Or put like stripes , oh yeah , yellow lights .	ES2010b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
166.67	I will go .	ES2002a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
591.0	the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so 	ES2002a.D.words.xml	appeal	[]	[]	[]
722.77	Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other 	ES2002a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
946.4	Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined .	ES2002a.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
176.76	Just think that fifty percent of the words on average whatever corpus you take are stop words , articles , et cetera .	IN1016.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
274.66	In that case , even the slight improvements uh he gets at that point , they can make the difference .	IN1016.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
503.63	So the fact of having that information somewhere can help you to improve the recognition .	IN1016.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
512.89	First , for example , fifty percent of the words in any kind of text are stop words .	IN1016.B.words.xml	stop	[]	[]	[]
536.8	To have a quantitative measure , mm-hmm , we simply did uh a measure of statistical independence between the words in general , so not some words , the words in general .	IN1016.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[mm]
558.84	have to make it overall .	IN1016.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
610.89	Because certain words for sure have a strong dependency on the slides .	IN1016.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
979.9	Indication , a clear indication , whether actually does it support of the discussion or not .	IN1016.B.words.xml	support	[]	[]	[]
1155.71	Some of them you can do it on a single meeting .	IN1016.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1166.75	You can put it in that in that way .	IN1016.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1233.04	But I mean you can do other work if you consider in terms of speaker turns or in terms of slides , and that is immediately multiply .	IN1016.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1254.49	I mean just uh well it is ju just few few few times we talk together and it was just , mean , the very quick thing you can can have uh like this .	IN1016.B.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[ju]
1365.82	Maybe to improve the recognition that way is not uh something you can expect .	IN1016.B.words.xml	improve	[]	[]	[]
1441.11	A and it says so I mean based on this work , do you figure out uh a direction if they guess correctly .	IN1016.B.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
1778.64	And consider also that we all speak English here .	IN1016.B.words.xml	consider	[]	[]	[English]
1823.9	Then you can change of task and use a task , the task we were mentioning about the back channel or foreground channel .	IN1016.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1958.29	know , without thinking we want to recognize , just to have them .	IN1016.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
2092.78	Let's say that uh in any case uh w well there are two reason .	IN1016.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2168.67	Although at that point we can use this .	IN1016.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2170.53	I mean I was mention the the lapel microphone mm just like this .	IN1016.B.words.xml	mention	[]	[]	[]
2200.55	It's more realistic and um yeah , probably it can help go in this direction of saying well let's see what happen between speech and slides .	IN1016.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
2436.82	So when you have a bullet list can I click on one of the bullet and get the piece of speech where the guy was talking about that .	IN1016.B.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
2669.83	If the p if they put in the outline uh let's say title one , title two , then you'll you find title one , title two .	IN1016.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2958.81	This will improve the phoneme uh recognition rate .	IN1016.B.words.xml	improve	[]	[]	[]
3312.09	I think , yeah , with a better uh phoneme recognition rate definitely it could uh improve also the the call routing performance .	IN1016.B.words.xml	improve	[]	[]	[]
3326.93	But we can we can find .	IN1016.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
3334.73	But we can some way find a guy .	IN1016.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
3337.54	I mean this should should be have all details , so it should be relatively easy to at least this is the last news I had and then I can try to get him back .	IN1016.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1304.13	we'll probably have to implement that .	TS3011a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
616.2	Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention , but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	overlap	[]	[]	[William]
642.56	So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T.V. to make make it as simple as possible .	ES2004b.A.words.xml	purpose	[]	[]	[William, T.V.]
736.49	Yeah , with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly .	ES2004b.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
747.62	that's so this is if you ask me personally , I would make uh 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
754.47	flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that .	ES2004b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
807.27	It'll have to this can't be pulled .	ES2004b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
813.0	You'll have to push it a bit more .	ES2004b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1446.33	Maybe for U.S. and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah .	ES2004b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[U.S., Japan]	[]
1537.5	We could focus on the biggest market .	ES2004b.A.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
1835.6	I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .	ES2004b.A.words.xml	refer	[]	[]	[]
2067.28	We could look in at that but 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2074.1	rather than like sea-shells , logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .	ES2004b.A.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
2110.55	Yeah we could look in at that .	ES2004b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2154.55	Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design .	ES2004b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[des]
2162.83	But we can like think of five , six designs .	ES2004b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
93.27	Um I'm the Project Manager of this project , and uh , well I will tell you on what actually is the project .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[Project, Manager]
106.19	Um this is the opening , then we will get I will hope we will get acquainted to each other .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
112.06	We'll do a little tool training with these two things .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
115.33	We'll take a look at the project plan .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
122.62	And then we will close this session .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
169.91	Let's start with the ladies .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
256.11	But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
266.29	we will have to take advantage of these two things .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
269.86	As you can see , you can give a presentation on them .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
276.74	I will uh instruct you about that soon .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	instruct	[]	[]	[]
306.67	Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page , um uh to go back and forward between pages , and of course uh to save it every now and then .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
330.51	Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
336.14	As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , it's not such a fast board , it's a smart board but also a slow board .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
342.64	Uh but you can write things and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things , so we have uh est left .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
351.43	And um you can also delete an entire page , but we ask you not to do that .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	delete	[]	[]	[]
355.84	Just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
364.37	Um does everyone understand this 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
369.58	Well you can erase it with the eraser , but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page , but just create a new blank one .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	erase	[]	[]	[]
375.42	I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	delete	[]	[]	[]
378.82	But you can of course erase when you make a mistake , but don't uh delete entire pages .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	erase	[]	[]	[]
384.32	And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
407.32	It's also to gets to know each other because um I'm asking three things , uh for that uh drawing , to do it on a blank sheet , with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour , and also with different pen widths which I also showed you .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
431.42	and um try to draw 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
435.56	Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing , eh .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	guess	[]	[]	[]
800.72	Uh what's your experience with remote controls , um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , maybe for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
845.67	Well maybe we should try to make it fun .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1133.8	Let's see what more I have to tell you .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1139.51	Um our next meeting uh will start well we're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1168.89	Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert]
1173.46	The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer]
1184.78	Uh will take a look at the the working design .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1196.46	Let's just use the acronyms .	TS3005a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
61.65	We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
103.84	So that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
124.12	So again um , I'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
151.35	And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
243.75	go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
249.41	and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[Kate, Kendra]
275.14	Uh so , if if we can have the the three presentations again please , and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
518.39	And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
542.15	Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	appear	[]	[]	[]
604.67	Cause uh I must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	Cause	[]	[]	[]
651.58	uh decide .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
951.05	Mm yeah , it'll get there .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1026.37	Sorry y y yeah , if I can interrupt you .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	interrupt	[]	[]	[]
1065.01	Three buttons , channel up channel up down and 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	channel	[]	[]	[]
1604.77	And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look , you know , t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1708.46	Oh no that well there's the sim my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	shape	[]	[]	[sorta, ho]
1938.94	Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete , but that's a slightly inappropriate word um to something that we can we can see and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[Andrew]
2037.08	Um and uh we we , know , we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
2075.09	that to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway , and uh and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , then uh you know , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets , I won't mention any mention any names , um it's uh it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
2121.35	And the you know , that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , 'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life , so no , I mean given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually uh uh unnecessary I think .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	clobber	[]	[]	[]
2136.3	As uh as wide cer certainly wider angle than than current , so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh you know , i i it will work most of the time um .	ES2012c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
179.32	Okay I'll just email you this file , my presentation .	IS1000c.A.words.xml	email	[]	[]	[]
321.98	Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out .	IS1000c.A.words.xml	stand	[]	[]	[]
327.97	People will wanna buy it .	IS1000c.A.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
385.3	That would make it stand out .	IS1000c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
396.56	Well ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing .	IS1000c.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[ma, necessar, sp, spongy]
440.53	Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is .	IS1000c.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
456.24	So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that .	IS1000c.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
462.98	So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever .	IS1000c.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[li]
488.52	People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas .	IS1000c.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
599.74	This is gonna be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least .	IS1000c.A.words.xml	afford	[]	[]	[]
1034.0	You can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features .	IS1000c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1905.48	Mm well one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys .	IS1000c.A.words.xml	slide	[]	[]	[]
1963.59	Can we have can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box that's a maybe curved or something .	IS1000c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
47.64	Did you wanna take a look at comments .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
268.08	Actually , I know , that might also help .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
539.19	Wonder if that would be useful for some of the other stuff we're doing .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	Wonder	[]	[]	[]
566.09	Or just return a null or a blank or a blank string or something , yeah .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	return	[]	[]	[]
714.84	Actually I can up-load my stuff as well , I just have to make one change to your file .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
719.09	Just to load this one instead of the the default .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
744.27	I did in my directory , just uh just do that , yeah .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
761.14	Right , yeah , and then update .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	update	[]	[]	[]
769.02	Um yeah , I'll just make that one and I'll let you know .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
775.97	So , anyways um and then you can play .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
789.38	Yeah , and just um to wire in the the topics and uh summaries .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	wire	[]	[]	[]
802.97	just wanna find out what kind of objects those were that um for the other ones .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[wanna]
1065.55	Well we can put the logic in a , yeah .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1135.46	Or well the things they may n just be looking for a word or whate you know , like and if it shows up ten different meetings , then at that point they'll probably wanna like we do we want to like if it dumped by default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returned , I mean then they have to go through the 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1155.8	Uh like when it loads up it'll load up the transcript window and the , whatever , other window .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
1237.75	So each time when we have a she search window and we have like , you know , ten different meetings , you know , with the word wireless comes up , go to meeting one , then it has to reload the nom object .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[nom]
1255.39	It always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least , like that's all I I've been doing lately is just sort of loading it up , test it , try something else and then shut down , load it up .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	test	[]	[]	[]
1310.61	And that way if they know specifically which meaning it is then that'll save the time .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1318.8	So yeah , or they could check mark against the ones they wanna check .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
1331.08	We can probably do that ourselves and just sort of B.D.B. , you know , just do a a string .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[B.D.B.]
1347.67	That probably even might have a .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1359.99	See if it's accurate .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1410.96	Um they did have all that and it was sorta built in and just uh had some trouble getting it running properly .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1709.45	Let's not make it more complicated .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1803.29	Actually it should work , yeah .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1828.76	Do the P.D.F.s , switch it to Postscript , switch it back to P.D.F. , and then 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[P.D.F.s, Postscript, P.D.F.]
1884.05	Search for stuff or start working or No .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	Search	[]	[]	[]
1887.59	Or or browse okay , like search , browse um 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	browse	[]	[]	[]
1895.94	Like if they if they know exactly where they wanna go , they wanna go to , you know , that meeting on December third , and they just wanna go there and see stuff , then they can immediately go and browse that .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	go	[December third]	[]	[]
1919.72	Browse by meeting , browse by blah , browse by speaker .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	Browse	[]	[]	[]
1926.79	Like if they're looking for particular person , particular working group , particular whatever , I mean we just uh we could break things down like that to that level of detail if we want .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	break	[]	[]	[]
1936.71	Or we could keep a more general .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1959.04	Like if they're part of X. working group , they'll wanna get in there .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	wanna	[]	[X.]	[]
1967.86	Well , if they're part of B.D.B. working group , they're gonna wanna look at the B.D.B. ones and so we'd default to that .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	default	[]	[]	[B.D.B., B.D.B.]
2015.41	Like there is just a range of things we could do , we could have like search options , browse options .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2024.45	Um and then we can tie this into our evaluation uh tasks and say well if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular meeting , then do this , blah blah blah .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	tie	[]	[]	[]
2036.3	So we can , yeah , sort of um , you know , guide them .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	guide	[]	[]	[]
2079.92	Probably or search something .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	search	[]	[]	[]
2092.25	Yeah , like find specific meeting .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2185.2	In a case like that we do want drop-down .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2491.87	Get away .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	Get	[]	[]	[]
2503.72	Um could go 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2507.76	Or if we could try one .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2508.95	We could try shortly after .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2513.79	Would you wanna no , probably not .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
2695.0	Well , create a new yeah .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
2728.13	We'll have we'll have to talk to Pernilla about this then , just 'cause uh see how she's uh doing this .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Pernilla]
2732.25	'Cause if we are using that , I mean it does make sense for that , but uh yeah , and just actually yeah .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2754.34	Um and then we could actually put that like on the list of um meetings that r get returned .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2832.24	Hmm look through them all .	EN2002c.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
141.69	We should have these things in our area .	EN2006a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
385.67	and we can point at it .	EN2006a.A.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
609.16	Uh I'd agree with that , I think .	EN2006a.A.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
928.55	Well , I mean you could look at this this spectrum and spot that um th L Lyman alpha has been damped. .	EN2006a.A.words.xml	look	[]	[L Lyman]	[]
1391.46	Uh and he could point at it , that's true , and say that is 	EN2006a.A.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
1740.62	We'll go p could be here all day .	EN2006a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2005.91	have any of it , I think .	EN2006a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2171.48	Lines in the spectrum , and you'll uh estimate 	EN2006a.A.words.xml	estimate	[]	[]	[]
2244.9	Well , then have it in .	EN2006a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3080.25	But , have a component though as such .	EN2006a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3518.8	And you s speed it up as well I think .	EN2006a.A.words.xml	speed	[]	[]	[]
535.04	Yeah , you can go back up to the feature , you know .	IN1002.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
763.55	I can put all the system back here .	IN1002.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
782.77	The only thing is that I have to do is that they have uh data in uh one particular structure , so I have to first of all , you know , organise create tar files , and then I can get it back here .	IN1002.C.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
800.21	Yeah , that I can get all those things .	IN1002.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
813.74	Uh uh one uh one uh day one o one , two days , like this week I can wait and see .	IN1002.C.words.xml	wait	[two days, this week]	[]	[]
1147.83	They are they're it's it's it looks like if you get three disk gone , then it's very difficult to get it well like fine if it's one disk it's fine because at least one is having the uh mirror mirror , so it will recache on the mirror .	IN1002.C.words.xml	recache	[]	[]	[]
1179.92	Mayb yeah , otherwise it uh it'll go on destroying other disks .	IN1002.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Mayb]
1230.74	It's kind of like essentially if it is like hundred twenty , hundred hundred G.B. data space , then it essentially will have a hun two hundred G.B. only stu visible data f to you .	IN1002.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[G.B., hun, G.B.]
1249.17	Inter internally it can do that kind of thing , but if the th if the three disks fail , then it's it's it's yeah , a really difficult job , I don't know how it can be recovered .	IN1002.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1273.66	Uh th simple , yes , the simple thing might cost you minimum ten thousand Euros , fifteen , something like that .	IN1002.C.words.xml	cost	[fifteen]	[]	[Euros]
1323.21	And so you can go up to fourteen or something like that , but it can be on the same yeah .	IN1002.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1330.75	But so it tries to put if you it tries to uh quickly put things uh if this way that so that and but only thing that only one has the mm um backup , keep taking up the backup there .	IN1002.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1344.85	So it puts everything mm quickly , it can decide wherever it wants to put , so it's faster to do that way .	IN1002.C.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1372.94	It can allow .	IN1002.C.words.xml	allow	[]	[]	[]
1375.41	Yeah , so it they have five , and you can go up to fourteen if you want to keep there .	IN1002.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1381.3	And it can still work , and it takes the and the way it look like it it's still tolerant , you know .	IN1002.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1398.76	Otherwise unsaved data will start the first thing is to get lo lost .	IN1002.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1428.27	If they can easily recover it , well 	IN1002.C.words.xml	recover	[]	[]	[]
1432.41	To do this kind of thing , you know .	IN1002.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1438.94	You know , sometimes the small hardware thing , they might do it to then , you know , five thousand Euros and all .	IN1002.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1474.48	No no , that's what they say , like you do it , then send it the hard disk , then they will say okay , we can do it , and then if you do it with only with only yeah .	IN1002.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1527.55	And in fact if they they can go a lot , but you know , they can go block by block and look into it and try to recover , but um that Matthew will want to go or not is the question .	IN1002.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Matthew]
1893.97	Yeah , well yeah , so I j I d do I did try it yeah , th that's how you do that .	IN1002.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1941.43	At least they could give us time to I think that uh the most of those things should be there .	IN1002.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1946.78	I can hope it already if they could 	IN1002.C.words.xml	hope	[]	[]	[]
2063.33	Oh , that is fire will lose all the data , you know .	IN1002.C.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
2141.75	For example f phonebook I can recover everything on phonebook , because I have it on the C.D. .	IN1002.C.words.xml	recover	[]	[]	[C.D.]
2166.47	I could recover it back from there actually , but 	IN1002.C.words.xml	recover	[]	[]	[]
2336.66	You can uh you can convert the same thing into triphone segmentation , because there is monophone and triphone , they are not different , except that you're just going to give a different label to them p depending on the context .	IN1002.C.words.xml	convert	[]	[]	[]
60.42	So we will get back th on that .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
74.13	So we'll discuss that later .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
86.23	What have do we have to do .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
89.61	First you can save the documents .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
96.8	You can print it .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	print	[]	[]	[]
113.45	So I'll make an example .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
125.23	You can use the pen .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
129.72	And then you can make um 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
139.58	Um you can change some things .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
152.2	change it .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
159.55	And you can change the 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
187.66	Now we can make a new one .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
548.87	So um you can always go back .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
564.25	The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[Euros]
926.6	Well look on your .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
932.58	Next instructions you'll get in your email .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
940.27	See you later in half an hour .	TS3010a.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1340.98	Then a spell-check might make make sense .	EN2004a.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1343.99	But uh to just use simple Emacs , it will uh basically mark um all the word fragments for you , and uh , you know , and I know from experience , at some point you also get negligent , you just click okay okay okay , you know , that's not a mistake , and then you might miss a real error .	EN2004a.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[Emacs]
2063.66	Just to make sense of a sentence .	EN2004a.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2318.79	Know the people na people's names , like when you 	EN2004a.C.words.xml	Know	[]	[]	[]
2548.1	Yeah , I can hear the chairs moving and the 	EN2004a.C.words.xml	hear	[]	[]	[]
2899.36	Um that's it's something under signal , where you can adjust the amplitude as well , on resolution .	EN2004a.C.words.xml	adjust	[]	[]	[]
2909.43	Then you can also wait .	EN2004a.C.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
2920.6	Um the vertical zoom , you can adjust that as well , so if it seems too flat for you or you can't really 	EN2004a.C.words.xml	adjust	[]	[]	[]
3368.58	Excuse me .	EN2004a.C.words.xml	Excuse	[]	[]	[]
130.71	Technical pa I would think .	IS1008d.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[Technical, pa]
364.85	No , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice .	IS1008d.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
576.32	Display in .	IS1008d.D.words.xml	Display	[]	[]	[]
607.49	And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh the cost of the unit for the company .	IS1008d.D.words.xml	inflate	[]	[]	[]
690.04	If we can go to to my display .	IS1008d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
693.58	And we'll come back to yours just to give everybody an idea of the market .	IS1008d.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
736.95	Uh functional , try functional , it might not be it either , but we'll see .	IS1008d.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
745.38	So we'll go screen by screen .	IS1008d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
766.11	So if we continue , we'll look at the findings .	IS1008d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
808.96	Twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units .	IS1008d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
832.58	Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production .	IS1008d.D.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
962.87	You can customise a watch , you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production , you can change it uh 	IS1008d.D.words.xml	customise	[]	[]	[]
971.23	And when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way uh it's possible to do with this , maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could you know , feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit .	IS1008d.D.words.xml	look	[one year]	[]	[feasibili]
118.88	I'll do it .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
195.07	Make browsers for the rest of the night .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
236.21	j do you want remo move that just n just for nicety .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
374.39	But um , you know , I would make them a bit nice if I had more time , but at the moment it doesn't look like that .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
439.03	Try that a few times .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
591.49	I mean do we do we care if , you know why not w I think , you know , it'd be it'd be difficult 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	care	[]	[]	[]
649.97	Yeah , just do top five , both local and global , and then have another 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	top	[]	[]	[]
760.24	Yeah , I mean just keep it simple as 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
909.96	Well , I can dr 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	dr	[]	[]	[]
923.26	Well if you find anything , then send it to me .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
926.23	Otherwise I'll I'll make up some M. .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[M.]
943.83	But I'll have to import it somehow .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1108.48	So you just like right , I'll try this then and see what it gives me .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1187.98	and make it up together .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1205.89	And that would give us the whole weekend .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1267.1	He would he would make something up .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1269.34	Ha yeah , find some people , that's how I understood it .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1322.03	It'll have to be , yeah .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1370.42	And hen we should just have two .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1437.28	Well , you know , the the question is , i do we need the evaluation for the presentation .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1446.73	We should definitely ask him .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1573.54	So we would def 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	def	[]	[]	[]
1627.84	But we can write a lot .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
1686.22	before half past six , I will make that file readable , writable , everything .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1699.06	Well I will I will need your snippets of code or it'd be good if I had them by tomorrow evening .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1816.79	Well you could look up 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1825.33	Because it the transcription window does cross-highlighting .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	cross	[]	[]	[]
1837.44	And um when you when you g um right-click on a topic , it pops open the list of meetings that contain that pop po topic .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1856.45	you could take that for loading .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1962.79	Well i i i in any case , if you left-click on on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open , then it should cross-highlight .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	cross	[]	[]	[]
2006.17	Can you make 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2019.3	Just just take that away , the the local check-box .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
2035.75	Everything else can just stay the same , you know .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
2037.98	In fact you can just leave everything as it is and just remove the check-box .	EN2002d.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
39.9	L I could take notes this time , I guess .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
59.54	Um actually I can just take that if you want .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
158.97	Well it's something that he had mentioned in the um in the previous like just to sort of have a prototype together , and so I was just saying that , you know , we could potentially do that .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
177.85	Like the thing is I was thinking even in the stuff that I was doing , I mean , just throw the screen-shots in there when you talk about what you're doing , right .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
222.93	Um did someone else wanna throw it togeth Actually I can probably still throw it together if you want , um put your parts into into this one .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[wanna]
237.45	Let's just cut out the middle man , you know .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
304.88	So I'll send it off to you .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
428.81	Search , yeah .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	Search	[]	[]	[]
549.84	Well I could probably just copy that straight out of the other one as well .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	copy	[]	[]	[]
605.05	We could just make it up .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
607.24	Like I'll claim one , you'll claim the other for the search things , and then we could leave that one as a a joint one .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	claim	[]	[]	[]
634.36	Have an image in my mind and I just wanna see it on the thing and then get a nice screen-shot .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
662.73	I mean you write down the words and the ideas as , oh , okay , well I'll do this , I'll do that , you know , it just all falls together .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
830.92	So that when they , you know , click on that , it's gonna go to the relevant thing .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
888.13	No , just just panes , just result panes for each of the three no no no , no No .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	result	[]	[]	[]
1134.76	Okay , maybe I should maybe I should use that as well in my Yeah , okay .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1297.04	The thing is like well how would we display the like if we do take disfluencies out and just c you know , create a text file , take the disfluencies out of the text file and then yeah .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
1405.31	I was just thinking as well , I mean we could probably even use like X.S.L.T. to kinda just transform it and , you know , flip it into uh yeah , just uh transforms um like um style sheet , the um X.M.L. style sheet .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[X.S.L.T.]	[X.M.L.]
1433.73	And then that way we could even pre-process that before hand .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	pre	[]	[]	[]
1494.08	So I might uh try and contact them , see if there's , I don't know , 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1502.25	Just to get things , I don't know , moving at a higher level I guess .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1631.46	Yeah , act 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	act	[]	[]	[]
1702.68	Snore .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	Snore	[]	[]	[]
1711.65	Or or she'll just take she can take it from now .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1721.14	Yeah , okay , actually no no n actually that's a good idea , I'll take one quick look over , try and get it as good as I think that we yeah .	EN2002b.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
68.53	So that'll probably keep me from pointing on my screen , which I usually it might just be at this point .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
83.9	In the end we did get it working before .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
240.99	But from Monday on I can just do twenty four seven for this one until it until it's due .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	do	[Monday, twenty four seven]	[]	[]
248.95	Like I can probably help people if they have problems with getting getting what we have running now .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
259.54	So I'll just start it up what we have now and then we can talk about what different people have and stuff .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
468.92	'Cause you'd reckon that you could leave them in and they would never show up in a summary anyway .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	reckon	[]	[]	[]
569.82	'Kay , shall we take a quick look at the current sys 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[Kay]
681.22	Somebody would try to solve a very similar problem where they also had two factors sort of and they want to weigh them together .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
702.29	Um and we can quote stuff on that .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	quote	[]	[]	[]
807.09	Yes , but also every other word in that sentence we should look at are probably in your list of fifty like list of all important words in the universe .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
855.27	So we might still have some problem here that it's not stopping at the end , but so Dave , can you make the promise even I'm not making the promise realistically that the girls will very soon get 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Dave]
922.16	Does anyone have a general overview over the whole time issue , like as in what date is it today , what date do we have to have this presented , what day of the week is that and issues like that .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	have	[today]	[]	[]
942.74	One week from today I shall hear the freedom ring from the hills and and everything and shall then throw myself into new slavery .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	hear	[One week]	[]	[]
1031.86	We should probably inquire about that or like integrate tool tips that would be visible .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	inquire	[]	[]	[]
1069.46	Having said that , Dave , we could probably w like if we want , we could probably go back to the c um to the group directory and just use this trick .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	w	[]	[]	[Dave]
1168.99	How we can just have a slide bar which we can read and write to , which is in a frame of that type .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1244.26	'Kay , it seems that at the moment a lot of the stuff that has to be done at sort of at the moment I'm saying oh Dave , can you do that .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[Kay, Dave]
1306.0	I mean seeing that it's over broad-band it's forwarding the graphics quite okay , it would probably like broad-band-wise , band-width-wise , probably work out .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1346.79	So that you can do on a DICE machine independent of w 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[DICE]
1439.09	So to come back to the problem we had before , so the reason why the summary didn't work well in the last one and works well now is because based on the bottom data the data is so homogeneously high in its imp importance rating that it just sort of then , everything else being equal , it took the first ones more or less .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1517.72	So the the good thing about that would be that if you simply say that whatever , one standard deviation below the mean is zero and one standard deviation above the mean is one or two standard deviations or something , then whatever the data is like , it would always normalise .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	normalise	[]	[]	[]
1538.03	I mean that would drop whatever is below or above .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
1618.05	So You would forget that that means that you would start it fifteen times over and have fifteen zombies running .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	forget	[]	[]	[]
1738.77	We could just make that uh like a run-time flag and then make a few ifs and say if 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1832.73	Yeah , we could just make 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1844.17	I'll effectively sort of go through all the segments and check if they're clicked on .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1901.01	If I can skip more accurately , then 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
2176.97	So and , yeah , and every and everything above that threshold I could then add the utterance where it occurs , just put a certain graphical item , like a handshake or something cool .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
2332.87	So basically a constant like that's Java's type of a constant , and give them names , like so zero T.D.I.D.F. , one that probably makes the code a lot more readable for everybody who's playing around with it .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[Java, T.D.I.D.F.]
2345.2	So just like whatever , three means agreement value , and then I'd just write something agreement , and then it's easier to understand for both of us what's going on .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
2767.36	'Cause be check out what they would be like on a word basis .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
2851.08	Seem to be having 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	Seem	[]	[]	[]
2859.49	Use a random s 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
2979.36	So if if the other performance is okay , then we should really just load the whole thing in .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	load	[]	[]	[]
3013.18	See , that probably just means that the display sort of has an internal knowledge about what level of zoom it has .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
3092.88	Um so Dave , can you just turn this what we have right now in 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[Dave]
3112.12	Make 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
3152.03	Let's say I put my mouse over this line here and then it would tell me something about what it is .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
3207.51	Otherwise I'll start looking into it as soon as I have time again .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
3257.95	Can you show me where because I'm actually not going to Appleton Tower at the moment .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[Appleton, Tower]
3275.64	Yeah , and I think like I'll just I'll just kick in full time for N.L.S.S.D. next week , 'cause there's nothing I have to do then .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	kick	[next week]	[]	[]
3465.5	But we can only really judge that once we have sound files .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	judge	[]	[]	[]
3482.96	Well net would run on anything .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	run	[]	[]	[]
3529.54	We can he can use my laptop as sort of like as a as a server as a sound server , but that would still mean that we have to get the speech tools running on this .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
3759.74	So actually a time change would automatically put the position of the display in the right play .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
3796.63	Yeah , you can set the window start utterance and window end utterance .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	set	[]	[]	[]
3842.98	Well you could you could put one point one when the other ones only go up to the one .	EN2001e.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
36.97	I I wish , you know , the the the the room would just detect when an when a meeting's started it starting .	IN1013.A.words.xml	detect	[]	[]	[]
144.22	You keep w okay , you can just write it on the paper .	IN1013.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
395.94	W what sort of coding do you get so far for the no no no no , f f yeah .	IN1013.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
554.01	Because I mean it'd be nice uh l let's say if you had twelve hundred bits for the for the sp smooth spectrum and twelve hundred bits for the voice , and then you could scale them both .	IN1013.A.words.xml	scale	[]	[]	[]
775.91	F and just use basic L.P.C. ten style .	IN1013.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[L.P.C.]
872.78	You can use like uh a codec sided or you could use a 	IN1013.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1064.11	Yes , but I mean you can reconstruct the the f the th the entire 	IN1013.A.words.xml	reconstruct	[]	[]	[]
1073.46	So you could do it that way .	IN1013.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1178.94	Well , one could argue it's it's a field that's quite a sort of a niche these days , isn't it .	IN1013.A.words.xml	argue	[these days]	[]	[]
1322.72	Push to talk and stuff like that .	IN1013.A.words.xml	Push	[]	[]	[]
1326.95	And I mean , as you say , I mean that delay is , I mean you can squash that delay to some extent , right .	IN1013.A.words.xml	squash	[]	[]	[]
1341.61	Because to get higher compression you have to , you know , take advantage of redundancy over longer time spans .	IN1013.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1364.41	We might have someone else joining our uh meeting soon .	IN1013.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1414.19	And then you can uh and then you can interpolate yeah , you can just pick the the um the harmonic amplitudes on that spectrum when you reconstruct on that smooth version of the spectrum when you reconstruct .	IN1013.A.words.xml	interpolate	[]	[]	[]
1446.96	Well it I mean you can use as many harmonics as you want .	IN1013.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1473.3	Um but y but uh you can still get a like you get th um basically if you do phase unwrapping and all of these other tricks , you end up with some sort of phase representation , which is some sort of monotonically decreasing function .	IN1013.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1499.91	And then maybe you'd need some sort of correction to um to correct minor phase discontinuities at some point in time .	IN1013.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1566.8	No , and you uh you wanna avoid hard choices on voicing decision , yeah .	IN1013.A.words.xml	avoid	[]	[]	[]
1632.78	Depending on the pitch , depending on the person , y you'll get a different amount of smoothing and a certain sort of so I mean , you know , if it's a female speaker for instance you yeah .	IN1013.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1677.85	But if you estimated it over a second , you should be able to get a decent estimate , I'd I'd think .	IN1013.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1734.12	It would have to be 'cause pitch shifts yeah .	IN1013.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1891.06	And it it does start to get a little bit n non-linear towards the end .	IN1013.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
2491.21	Basically s like I mean if you d if you see a lot of papers on like um on uh voice over I.P. or whatever , the the publications are sort of like um how do we deal with packet loss , or or how was it affected by packet loss and and and things like that .	IN1013.A.words.xml	deal	[]	[]	[I.P.]
2546.81	You could trow Matlab on a mobile phone these days .	IN1013.A.words.xml	trow	[these days]	[]	[Matlab]
2767.96	There's a lot of sort of , well , does the quality stand up to legal sort of requirements or whatever .	IN1013.A.words.xml	stand	[]	[]	[]
2807.28	You I mean maybe that's the best approach to look at to begin with is just pretend all you have got is 	IN1013.A.words.xml	pretend	[]	[]	[]
2827.5	So I mean maybe try to see how good you can go without transmitting any of that information .	IN1013.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2865.33	So I mean if you wanted to transmit with fewer bands , you'd maybe still keep the lower bands or or maybe you could still transmit the pitch .	IN1013.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
2976.3	Run length encoding , I'm out of here .	IN1013.A.words.xml	Run	[]	[]	[]
108.15	So basically for him to talk about what he what progress he's been making and then for us to um for hi for him to describe what work he intends over the next period of the project , and for us to figure out what help he needs with that .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	talk	[the next period]	[]	[]
121.87	Um m maybe give him some help figuring out what publications he's gonna um get out of this and for us to make sure that it fits into the overall project .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
546.32	So w so okay , so but you just said , I think , that you would characterise short turns as being the non-interactive parts .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	characterise	[]	[]	[]
564.99	Oh okay , well we we can discount back-channels .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	discount	[]	[]	[]
571.85	Or or do you get a c 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
657.11	So one speaker will have the floor channel um throughout that and so I guess what you're saying is that the interactive sections would have shorter speaker turns when you're not considering the back-channels as interruptions .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
687.74	Well do y 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
847.56	You can still um build maybe the the same argument structure over the top of the basic um acts and propositional content that's there .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
1523.14	So it would be I think handy if you could take a meeting at some point and say , you know , this is a interactive area and this is a mono-logic area because and we could come up with what kinds of measurements you need .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1567.58	So um but those kinds of measures um , you know , we could use to um to do this kind of segmentation if it's important to the analysis , right .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1596.16	What's the speaker turn , um you know , what kind of dialogue acts do you expect .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	expect	[]	[]	[]
1949.3	But I mean my understanding of exchange is is that the initiating move introduces a goal to the discourse , and then the remaining moves um will uh contribute to either the um the meeting of that discourse goal or the decision not to bother with that discourse goal , right .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	contribute	[]	[]	[]
1995.38	Like you might expect to have to extend the theory to do that .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	expect	[]	[]	[]
2270.14	But but a reading of this , you know , th could tell you that there is no case where you're gonna be looking for initiation and responses that's gonna work , you know .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
2279.37	'Cause you could go through and see that um actually the pattern of of addressing different discourse goals is too dispersed to um to be able to do that kind of mark-up .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2836.15	Should try to decide which shape the thing is .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
2969.97	Well you might need the meeting action segmentation in order to know where what uh what area you're circumventing for so , it's just exchange structure in this area that you're looking at , and then that's a solid boundary between the next bit or something .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
3186.97	See 'cause I think that um just to make this m more efficient , you should be thinking about the high-level goal in order to focus the work that you're doing rather than thinking well , you know , there's these theories , you know , how can we apply these theories to it .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
3202.02	Um and then seeing what comes out of that that might be useful for the meeting browser , actually trying to say yeah , we have a goal of being able to do this with the meeting browser , um what kinds of dialogue structure would we need to be able to do that .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
3314.0	So I mean uh I do think you should keep in mind what the final goal is so that you can plug this into something at the end and and um show some benefit of having the mark-up .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
3584.38	You know they've identified these seven different tasks people might wanna do with browsers , um you know , like uh join a meeting late and ch um catch up on what's happened in the meeting so far , be at home waiting for the washing repair guy .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	join	[]	[]	[]
3791.68	Can actually try .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
3875.31	So that should help some .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
3881.03	So so they'll accrue all of the normal an annotations .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	accrue	[]	[]	[]
3902.32	Yeah , just figure out how we're gonna help him to to try to make this more efficient .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
3959.7	Yeah , but we should make sure we finish that off , because otherwise that work's just wasted , right .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
4049.66	Well hold on .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
4083.12	You we can check the Wikis .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[Wikis]
4113.5	I'll have to look up , you know , so 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
4213.71	You could either um essentially go the same route as they did with the Switchboard um , you know , do the Penn tree-bank and then create the chunks off that , or you could chunk directly .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Switchboard, Penn]
4235.24	Right , well , so you'd have to produce as part of this exercise .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
4365.29	The names would suggest that this was the idea , right .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[]
4486.73	See , I wasn't there .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
4503.99	So ask 'em , right .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
4560.58	If it does , ask D.F.K.I. either for data or a time scale , and you're gonna need to know how much data you need in order to do that .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[D.F.K.I.]	[]
4584.57	So just ask D.F.K.I. how much data and when , right .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	ask	[]	[D.F.K.I.]	[]
4696.09	But that's a pretty tight time scale then , right , 'cause it'd be for the fall we'd wanna know the evaluation .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
4725.47	I think you should still ask Barbara again , you know , c can you have another think about who might have the chunking stuff .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Barbara]
4739.83	So and then we can evaluate on the ICSI , you know , pretty easily .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[ICSI]
4803.93	But that wou that would help us be a lot more specific ab than than just um you know , listing bullet points on slides cause then we'd know sort of which literature you're thinking of um putting in and we could read the most important argumentative stuff .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[ab]
4818.04	I can have these things anyway , yeah .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
4925.29	So you can do this exercise and then come and talk to me some time next week .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	do	[next week]	[]	[]
4975.26	And we can put that on a Wiki or we can do it some other way .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[Wiki]
4979.38	So um if we share it , it should go on a Wiki 'cause I can't find anything in my email .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[Wiki]
5110.41	So you wanna go through basically the user requirements and , you know , maybe think about some user requirements of your own and make a case for , you know , these are the kinds of things that we'd want , and look , you're gonna need um this kind of dialogue or argument structure for it .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
5132.46	Um uh uh I'll think about that .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
5213.56	So then try front-runner scheme on , well , a front-runner theory .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
5223.81	But try it informally .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
5228.09	'Cause I really do have to go .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
5241.51	So we'll get together in about three weeks .	EN2005a.B.words.xml	get	[about three weeks]	[]	[]
381.47	Uh and also compact in shape .	IS1009d.C.words.xml	compact	[]	[]	[]
620.31	Tell , yeah .	IS1009d.C.words.xml	Tell	[]	[]	[]
1656.82	yeah , include some more buttons and uh um yeah features .	IS1009d.C.words.xml	include	[]	[]	[]
1661.06	We can make the buttons few buttons smaller .	IS1009d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
57.24	Um tool training , we're going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles .	ES2010a.A.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
104.67	Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet .	ES2010a.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
113.75	And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote .	ES2010a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
127.7	And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here .	ES2010a.A.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
164.98	Bless you .	ES2010a.A.words.xml	Bless	[]	[]	[]
190.14	Oh do I .	ES2010a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
350.27	Look at my sad sad giraffe .	ES2010a.A.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
370.53	Yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look .	ES2010a.A.words.xml	appreciate	[]	[]	[]
376.81	Guess we're getting straight back into business here .	ES2010a.A.words.xml	Guess	[]	[]	[]
510.2	So that people like my mother can use it .	ES2010a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
627.14	I would think so .	ES2010a.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
657.48	I could lose that in a minute .	IS1009c.D.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
754.76	Have to come back to that later .	IS1009c.D.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
1371.09	We'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost .	IS1009c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1381.88	Go right to my first my next slide .	IS1009c.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1418.86	And I would encourage you all to do the same .	IS1009c.D.words.xml	encourage	[]	[]	[]
1449.23	Go ahead , I'm trying to finish fast for you .	IS1009c.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1468.4	And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign .	IS1009c.D.words.xml	develop	[]	[]	[]
855.67	You can still keep the same frame rate .	IN1012.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1568.14	And then you can more or less uh quantise those segments somehow and use it for encoding let's say , or and it worked prett yeah , yeah .	IN1012.B.words.xml	quantise	[]	[]	[prett]
1803.29	Once somebody will come with something new , okay , he he's showing it works for some datas , but still yeah , yeah .	IN1012.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
2154.45	She even is f it was forbidden in the time , right , so you have recogniser , just use it .	IN1012.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2460.61	Somebody will fix it and change it , but 	IN1012.B.words.xml	fix	[]	[]	[]
2550.97	It and you can train it , like only your speech or it's general uh it's quite interesting , yeah .	IN1012.B.words.xml	train	[]	[]	[]
2613.07	Yeah , drag the mouse there .	IN1012.B.words.xml	drag	[]	[]	[]
642.49	Or do I have to put in in the sh 	EN2001d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[sh]
1700.16	I would have to tag uh some part of it or something .	EN2001d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2045.36	concatenate all those , shouldn't be too bad .	EN2001d.C.words.xml	concatenate	[]	[]	[]
3236.01	Or how do you d 	EN2001d.C.words.xml	d	[]	[]	[]
188.05	Uh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	probable	[]	[]	[]
196.1	We can go into that later .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
197.73	Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
221.46	We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
330.6	Um , we also can choose what materials um , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R.S.I. .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[R.S.I.]
393.11	You can just slide up and down .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	slide	[]	[]	[]
407.72	And that would lead to an advanced yeah .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	lead	[]	[]	[]
427.28	But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
439.56	Um simple would go with the pushbutton .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
442.52	Um , regular you could link with the scroll button .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	link	[]	[]	[]
496.67	And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L.C.D. , 'cause we probably can't afford that one .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
573.19	Or like an you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just it's protective as well .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[iPods]
579.23	It , it stops it , I mean , it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	reduce	[]	[]	[]
1119.01	I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	assume	[]	[]	[]
1124.04	So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1210.17	You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1439.13	Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1443.38	And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	strip	[]	[]	[]
1459.42	Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1476.53	But may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1649.36	be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and well hope that it works .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	hope	[]	[]	[]
1662.83	Go for it .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1736.13	I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1996.92	We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2096.37	We can have a look at those ideas , yeah .	ES2015c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3.72	So we'll show you two slightly different presentations .	IB4005.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
6.47	Feel free to ask any questions or comments , obviously .	IB4005.A.words.xml	Feel	[]	[]	[]
16.63	And the rationale that we have , I'll show you the layout in a second , was that full professors would get private offices .	IB4005.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
42.78	Um , so I'll just show you how that works .	IB4005.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
59.72	Um , just to go back , most people are grouped in projects .	IB4005.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
170.72	She's It's Do you wanna explain how it it works or 	IB4005.A.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[]
368.55	have a quiet place to sips sit , they have a lot of light and 	IB4005.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
420.97	If we can get stuff like that , it might be a good idea .	IB4005.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
450.87	Well , do you want to do your presentation and 	IB4005.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
762.95	Oh , in a way , if that's your argumentation , then put a visiting person with a senior 	IB4005.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1040.87	I mean , suppose if the need really arises and it comes to a point where we do have a lot of people , then you can get rid of the lounge , figure out what to do with the furniture , either distribute it between various offices or put it into storage somewhere .	IB4005.A.words.xml	suppose	[]	[]	[]
1072.06	no have some quiet time and That's where it came from .	IB4005.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1100.12	Yeah yeah , and people can come w in with their stuff or leave a newspaper or a magazine lying around for other people .	IB4005.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1380.88	Okay well , since this one's up , keep this one in .	IB4005.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1386.92	Easily , go ahead .	IB4005.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1569.03	Well you can move Maggie and Bruno 	IB4005.A.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[Maggie, Bruno]
1574.77	Move Gisella , move the other spare place to the big room , but then there's not a lot of people in there .	IB4005.A.words.xml	Move	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1764.22	Actu Bruno did mention that he didn't want to be in a room with a lot of people , 'cause he did that before and he didn't really like it .	IB4005.A.words.xml	mention	[]	[]	[Actu, Bruno]
1958.89	Mm sure , yeah , we can do that .	IB4005.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1979.13	So I'll save that .	IB4005.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1999.07	I'll circulate it to everyone , along with the numbers that you guys wanted to see in terms of the space .	IB4005.A.words.xml	circulate	[]	[]	[]
118.86	Slap it .	TS3008a.B.words.xml	Slap	[]	[]	[]
196.85	Hope it working .	TS3008a.B.words.xml	Hope	[]	[]	[]
615.45	I will try .	TS3008a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
618.26	I will try .	TS3008a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1143.33	Uh , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market .	TS3008a.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[yo]
1195.54	Use friendly .	TS3008a.B.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
1317.99	I will need it .	TS3008a.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
346.38	Yeah but Yeah but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control because the 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	happen	[]	[]	[]
371.35	And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
488.04	Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one .	IS1003c.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
561.16	To talk to the to the T.V. maybe .	IS1003c.B.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[T.V.]
755.59	Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	wh	[]	[]	[]
1060.64	the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery so .	IS1003c.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1200.68	integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .	IS1003c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1583.62	Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1670.68	And pf what can we think a supplement to 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1702.42	To push button , yeah , yeah .	IS1003c.B.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
1767.46	expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1803.43	Need it to be , okay .	IS1003c.B.words.xml	Need	[]	[]	[]
3.67	Uh first of all I'll start with the costs , because that's going to influence our design .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
156.43	That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	skip	[four and a half]	[]	[Euros]
197.13	Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
303.12	You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
363.92	Because if you d lose the L.C.D. screen , we need a lot of Yeah .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
436.17	That would save zero point two Euros compared to No .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
451.45	And we can drop these two .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	drop	[]	[]	[]
687.97	No y you would rec 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	rec	[]	[]	[]
701.42	You can use those Yeah .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
735.5	It would save enough Yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[Euro]
744.52	So we can maybe still use power button .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
771.01	Drop the special colour .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	Drop	[]	[]	[]
1151.39	Uh y we should fill this in now .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	fill	[]	[]	[]
1241.38	Uh check with the Excel sheet .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[Excel]
1249.15	Yeah integrate it .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[]
1254.94	Just go scrolling and it will activate .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1307.37	Because he's now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1328.72	To get into menu .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1333.16	Or hold it ten seconds .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
1453.82	Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[Excel]
1699.91	Count them .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	Count	[]	[]	[]
1932.01	So you can just make one big L.C.D. screen .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1957.31	Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1989.5	Yeah I'm I'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
2199.49	Even children can draw .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
2203.91	Can you just push pen and then keep on 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
2275.86	You can just reuse that , because the name is the same .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	reuse	[]	[]	[]
2356.47	And copy this .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	copy	[]	[]	[]
2617.73	And you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or oh no , they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	relax	[]	[]	[]
2643.82	Just uh do that quickly .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2804.96	Use the pen .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
2897.38	Uh we should uh enter our questionnaire .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	enter	[]	[]	[]
2943.26	Hope so .	TS3006d.A.words.xml	Hope	[]	[]	[]
357.3	energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well okay , never mind .	ES2007b.B.words.xml	pr	[]	[]	[]
386.34	then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
422.29	So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel .	ES2007b.B.words.xml	hear	[]	[]	[Gabriel]
425.74	And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels .	ES2007b.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
459.95	Um , should I erase this or 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	erase	[]	[]	[]
549.17	Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it .	ES2007b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
603.07	Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1517.48	You have them i you have them , but we'll send you an e-mail .	ES2007b.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1596.76	It could come 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1604.24	But it could come in different colours and have the R.R. colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the R.R. logo or colours and 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	come	[]	[R.R., R.R.]	[]
508.76	Suppose you have to go to the T.V. and do it manually .	ES2003d.D.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[T.V.]
969.84	Oh , and joystick , yeah .	ES2003d.D.words.xml	joystick	[]	[]	[]
1361.82	Think it's ten minutes left .	ES2003d.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1532.74	Put a leopard print on it .	ES2003d.D.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
1677.85	Yeah , I'll go with five .	ES2003d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1824.58	women would be going , oh look at that , 's cool , it looks like a it's 	ES2003d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2112.2	We'll still settle for twenty five .	ES2003d.D.words.xml	settle	[]	[]	[]
527.16	But we can take a risk .	TS3012d.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
814.3	Let's um see um 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
824.11	Let's 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
853.84	I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not .	TS3012d.D.words.xml	pre	[]	[]	[]
870.97	uh make a new blank sheet .	TS3012d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
906.43	Oh wait .	TS3012d.D.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
915.23	Look and feel is everybo it's true .	TS3012d.D.words.xml	everybo	[]	[]	[]
924.94	And the next one uh yeah , when it's lost uh you can find it .	TS3012d.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1048.41	But wha w oh , yeah .	TS3012d.D.words.xml	wha	[]	[]	[]
1129.1	So everybody's agree with an uh three on it , it's 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	agree	[]	[]	[]
1385.95	Yeah , you can make 'em another one .	TS3012d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2109.82	I will write that one 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
2178.12	Yeah , okay , I will ask you when uh I need the information .	TS3012d.D.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
64.32	Check check check check .	TS3004c.D.words.xml	Check	[]	[]	[]
469.84	Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something .	TS3004c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
502.85	We ma must have some kind of gadget .	TS3004c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[ma]
566.35	So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be .	TS3004c.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1343.04	Okay yeah , you can you can change Yeah .	TS3004c.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1883.48	Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have 	TS3004c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[mm]
1906.38	And um uh uh buy the product .	TS3004c.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
1913.19	Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project .	TS3004c.D.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1966.98	Maybe we can choose then .	TS3004c.D.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
2225.62	It must have uh uh uh a very different 	TS3004c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2296.59	If you set the pen yeah , he will draw here .	TS3004c.D.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
156.27	I mean we'll discuss it but 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
274.15	And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
296.84	Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U.I.D. and the I.D. you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[U.I.D., I.D.]
326.3	um to try t of sync it all up .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
346.13	um and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C.D.s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
484.26	Alright so um whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	write	[]	[]	[]
755.83	You can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C.D.s and things we like about the city you know , I think we'll 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	harness	[]	[]	[]
783.48	It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
786.19	Um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[Euros]
804.97	Um so something that could do N.T.S.C. as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D.V.D.s but um you know I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[N.T.S.C.]	[]
825.92	Um s right so um just to close up , I'm not sure how much time I've used mm next time right Project Manager , sorted .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[Project, Manager]
922.05	Well , have a think about it .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
951.01	That's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to um 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	brainstorm	[]	[]	[]
959.74	Let me bring up something about 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
986.39	All right we'll find them , we're on our own .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1136.87	Let's see .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1272.94	We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Pound, Dollar, Euro]
1288.82	Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that's black and you know m massive , some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1300.0	But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it and um 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1343.23	Although , computer parts , all if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the States .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	buy	[]	[States]	[]
1352.57	They serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	sell	[]	[America]	[Pounds]
1362.15	Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
1387.87	Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into .	ES2009a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
47.79	Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[Tod]
58.75	Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[Manager, Expert, wi]
92.7	Should stay in the square here .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
119.92	Oh , you can put it here .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
448.1	maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
547.99	Click on yes .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	Click	[]	[]	[]
902.92	So , maybe you can talk about the function , and 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
935.22	Open .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	Open	[]	[]	[]
947.06	It should work , so you can .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1401.93	So um uh we should we should keep uh The the product should be recognisable .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1444.12	So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1553.49	Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1577.7	Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1587.37	And inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
1731.25	Maybe with the L.C.D. we can do something with less buttons , but 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1786.25	We should hide them somewhere .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	hide	[]	[]	[]
1820.77	It should fit in those settings functions .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
2027.86	W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler it's is better .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2097.9	So maybe we think we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time next time .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
2106.79	Somebody booked the meeting room just for at one P.M. , and so we should leave .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[P.M.]	[]
2132.77	And uh I will do the minutes .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2142.23	And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on .	IS1005b.A.words.xml	receive	[]	[]	[]
382.46	So it will have five point five average .	IS1001d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
493.89	Yeah , we can we can put a seven here .	IS1001d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
520.14	So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely , or 	IS1001d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
427.01	Form 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	Form	[]	[]	[]
437.52	Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design .	ES2013d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Kate]
516.64	Can I scroll down on there and see what else 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
623.46	it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image .	ES2013d.C.words.xml	expect	[]	[]	[kiddie, toy]
645.19	Hold them , you see , you know .	ES2013d.C.words.xml	Hold	[]	[]	[]
738.39	I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , but we do definitely think that it's a viable option .	ES2013d.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
971.6	I'd call these quite uh minimalist , 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
1023.2	Well d we'll just call it fancy then .	ES2013d.C.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
1492.12	What does double curved mean , I don't understand .	ES2013d.C.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1711.49	Yeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder .	ES2013d.C.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
1841.51	to keep a simple old technology , which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , so .	ES2013d.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1852.66	So we do count as I think excellent or one .	ES2013d.C.words.xml	count	[]	[]	[]
1870.12	Bring on the ice sculptures .	ES2013d.C.words.xml	Bring	[]	[]	[]
325.31	So they do need to be in the 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
511.96	Do we have uh yeah .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
615.04	And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech alright .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
720.79	Ah look .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
774.27	Let me check .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
855.05	And then make the the design , a the actual design , but I never came around to do that .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1013.68	Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
1035.79	And yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1343.78	Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	block	[]	[]	[]
1545.68	Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1582.7	But so we have we have T.V. options , which is all this .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1693.43	Help .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	Help	[]	[]	[]
1775.03	to use 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2160.52	Yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
2181.59	sorry , uh is uh if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you're not already at your choice .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
2266.83	Bring it on .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	Bring	[]	[]	[]
2333.39	I'll try to .	TS3006b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
67.78	Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj .	ES2005c.C.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[Raj]
405.63	Excuse me .	ES2005c.C.words.xml	Excuse	[]	[]	[]
494.1	Uh no just escape 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	escape	[]	[]	[]
791.44	Um but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L.C.D. screens , w I ju I mean I wouldn't know about the costs of them .	ES2005c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
856.59	Well I mean we could make a Yeah .	ES2005c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1108.31	And that would k also give it kinda durability and 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1278.61	does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe .	ES2005c.C.words.xml	seem	[]	[]	[]
1333.01	Let's that'll make us fifty million Euros .	ES2005c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[Euros]
1350.04	Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	relate	[]	[]	[]
1381.35	Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop .	ES2005c.C.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1450.42	I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's Yeah .	ES2005c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1548.17	Make them make them think of fruit , yeah .	ES2005c.C.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1552.6	I mean uh some uh I l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple .	ES2005c.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1659.06	You can standardise those , I mean .	ES2005c.C.words.xml	standardise	[]	[]	[]
1714.85	And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
1788.17	So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1867.42	It does leave them with an obligation to Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated .	ES2005c.C.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
2077.49	Yeah , can you save that uh send that last one again , please , Raj , as I still can't find it on the 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[Raj]
2216.88	See .	ES2005c.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
2261.68	Um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , it's a 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
884.32	And so we would take uh uh one of the two people rooms and split it .	IB4003.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
887.82	And you would see that you would have the same size office , but that would give the privacy .	IB4003.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1146.5	Well , yeah , we'll skip that for now .	IB4003.C.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
1258.82	No , because they can share their ideas across the project , yeah , I would say .	IB4003.C.words.xml	share	[]	[]	[]
1360.26	You can smoke outside .	IB4003.C.words.xml	smoke	[]	[]	[]
1361.54	So you can go outside onto the balcony to smoke .	IB4003.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1422.47	No , we we do have one constraint that's difficult , which is uh Gisella , because when she's there she's very noisy .	IB4003.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1638.32	So we we invite invite and then we say , okay you can sit with Gisella .	IB4003.C.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1854.52	Okay , I'll ask um uh Maggie and Pierrette uh if they have uh any preferences .	IB4003.C.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[Maggie, Pierrette]
1926.65	Wait .	IB4003.C.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
1931.7	Wait , wait .	IB4003.C.words.xml	Wait	[]	[]	[]
1956.76	At nine thirty , but we could do we could have this meeting then in the afternoon .	IB4003.C.words.xml	do	[nine thirty]	[]	[]
84.83	You may have to do the function F. eight thing .	ES2015a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[F.]
470.91	We have moose too .	ES2015a.D.words.xml	moose	[]	[]	[]
298.9	You can manage all this , yeah .	IS1003a.D.words.xml	manage	[]	[]	[]
405.29	Yeah , I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer .	IS1003a.D.words.xml	guess	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer, wi, Industrial, Designer]
484.61	Yeah , maybe should go and draw an animal .	IS1003a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
567.36	Just go , you you the closest to the whiteboard .	IS1003a.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
279.97	Get yourself in position .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	Get	[]	[]	[]
453.98	when a T.V. programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	fuzz	[]	[]	[T.V.]
559.42	I'll have a Big Mac , please .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Big, Mac]
599.81	Let's have rubber push buttons , hey .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
720.96	Um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works , 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
741.62	S yeah , push buttons .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
845.66	It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
917.75	You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
949.64	And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	fuzz	[]	[]	[]
1284.55	Let's move over to 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1498.95	That would mean we'd have to make a television as well .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	mean	[]	[]	[]
1588.56	The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
1594.49	Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	encourage	[]	[]	[]
1787.44	L keep it clean , keep it clean .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1926.98	So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	market	[]	[]	[]
2010.95	Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[Gabriel]
2031.26	I think , yeah , it's gonna you know , come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[ki, ab]
2163.73	We'll look into this lock key 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2219.6	hold hold fire .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	hold	[]	[]	[]
2333.69	Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	finish	[]	[]	[]
2359.27	So maybe you should go back to your own offices .	ES2007c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
35.67	So b maybe I'll go back to your questions .	IN1009.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
80.74	Um from the spectrum you can transform the the magnitude spectrum and um um build model of the person .	IN1009.D.words.xml	transform	[]	[]	[]
260.56	Uh p no .	IN1009.D.words.xml	p	[]	[]	[]
290.92	Uh you will need to build statistical models of um the person identity using these measures .	IN1009.D.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
381.6	Yeah , so that might be good for example for ten minutes , but then the person might move , or a different person might come .	IN1009.D.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
456.54	But that you can do with location , if it's only on the short term .	IN1009.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
475.28	Like um to give feedback .	IN1009.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
484.24	So there you might want to use a 	IN1009.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
488.28	We had a student here , he finished uh one or two years ago , but he left his software , and his software is precisely to do that to um cluster at uh another level , to cluster these small clusters of speech , uh group them by person automatically .	IN1009.D.words.xml	cluster	[two years ago]	[]	[]
527.55	So I would say from location at the lower level you can get small parts of speech , and then at the next level , possibly off-line , you can uh group them into um a speech segment .	IN1009.D.words.xml	group	[]	[]	[]
552.3	Um so if I manage to do some um uh practically usable software , I'll tell you .	IN1009.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
581.73	So you said you want to do separation , um but ex exactly , yeah .	IN1009.D.words.xml	ex	[]	[]	[]
615.35	You might want .	IN1009.D.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
661.33	No no , you should separate them first , yeah , yeah .	IN1009.D.words.xml	separate	[]	[]	[]
670.1	So the type of things I presented can lead to separation .	IN1009.D.words.xml	lead	[]	[]	[]
688.46	Although it might be , if you want to um ex extract these features like pitch and uh rate of speech , or energy simply , from each person .	IN1009.D.words.xml	extract	[]	[]	[]
699.82	Um you might have to do some ba basic separation .	IN1009.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[ba]
732.8	You can email later .	IN1009.D.words.xml	email	[]	[]	[]
788.78	Yeah , you could detect one word , yeah .	IN1009.D.words.xml	detect	[]	[]	[]
855.46	It no , you can do that .	IN1009.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
882.01	So you can do that automatically , this kind of things .	IN1009.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
921.04	And the last one I would say is um the clustering um to um yeah , the clustering of the different locations over time , so that you can get small clusters of speech .	IN1009.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1068.42	So I I'll send you links some of the papers are long , but you can just um briefly look , yeah .	IN1009.D.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1080.26	Um we can go and see Olivier , unless you want to talk about something else .	IN1009.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1094.37	Well , we can try .	IN1009.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
91.81	You can call me Petre , or Peter if you like .	IS1005a.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[Petre, Peter]
317.31	So probably I would try to try to draw the animal .	IS1005a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
350.78	I would use the bird .	IS1005a.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
446.38	Oh just wait a little bit .	IS1005a.B.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
546.0	Just try .	IS1005a.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
605.39	Have to remember it .	IS1005a.B.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
797.35	Yeah , but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume .	IS1005a.B.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
833.36	Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if you have some more notes on that .	IS1005a.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
971.33	Sign .	IS1005a.B.words.xml	Sign	[]	[]	[]
109.59	We'll just uh open a new one .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
132.26	But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
137.15	And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
282.25	Well , we'll we'll have to skip that part then .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
377.35	Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
512.04	Well , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
851.97	So maybe we should leave all D.V.D. and V.C.R. related features off completely .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[V.C.R.]
867.64	New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
926.31	make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
933.58	Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	stay	[]	[]	[]
945.86	Yeah , you will have to look that up .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
975.95	That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
980.45	Well , if I can uh make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1027.41	M yeah , that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other , because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T.V. , but they s do aim at a younger Well , ma 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	aim	[]	[]	[T.V., ma]
1058.34	But I think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1069.8	You can uh , know , you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T.V. set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1087.34	But w maybe we should put some func uh , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D.V.D. player they want to , 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1114.56	Yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1215.16	If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1219.22	It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1242.87	Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1246.52	Well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[ju]
1250.34	So we should put uh zap buttons on it .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[zap]
1253.08	Um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1320.88	Or do you think it uh 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1347.9	Well yeah uh , lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using I think we should just put one teletext button on it .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	store	[]	[]	[]
1415.35	Yeah , and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1493.75	Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or Well , it was something about how we lose them .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	suggest	[]	[]	[]
1526.45	Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1582.49	So maybe uh that's i I think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it's very important to find something like this .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1593.5	And maybe we can all think about it .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1648.28	And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[shou]
1660.53	no no , put stuff inside it .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1667.49	Yeah yeah , but yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1696.9	Yeah , but but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
1739.52	Yeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and So , it's not gonna be that expen 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[Taiwan]	[ma]
1760.94	Well , I well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	recharge	[]	[]	[]
1765.26	And uh you can always find your remote control up 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1775.56	Well , maybe yeah , you could when that's when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , but you will you do need uh also an uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	skip	[]	[]	[]
1814.97	And make it , you know , we we um 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1822.46	We can save on the on the functions .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1824.19	We just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up , it's also nice .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1870.1	Oh , if it let's well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1913.39	Well , we will we will I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1977.33	M maybe we should really do this .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2013.2	Oh okay , I'll make sure I'll I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it won't work , but you'll see .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2045.08	Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could uh , know , use for the other ones well , but uh I d think uh I forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
2164.44	Put it in there uh wire on it .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
2220.57	When you you see it from the side , then it would look just like that .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2234.16	maybe put something on top of it or , you know , like that's looks funny .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2246.75	We'll have to think about it .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2251.22	We can save this one .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
2271.64	Mm , we'll hear about it .	TS3008b.A.words.xml	hear	[]	[]	[Mm]
77.41	And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
84.48	And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
99.46	And um evaluate the product , as a group .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[]
106.12	So first we'll have the prototype presentation .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
249.19	Yeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
441.2	Think like vanilla and banana would .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
526.29	Oh wait a minute .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
891.03	Ah it'd fall over all the time though .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	fall	[]	[]	[]
900.13	Come on .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	Come	[]	[]	[]
994.29	I would give it a two still though .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1140.55	Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	enter	[]	[]	[]
1150.73	And then like twelve , enter .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	enter	[]	[]	[]
1181.25	Your thumb might get a little bit uh 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1428.1	Go Heather Pauls .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[Heather, Pauls]
1453.15	um in our shared folder , if everyone could go there right now , um 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1503.34	Read only .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	Read	[]	[]	[]
1538.01	So um if you can look up at the screen , um the large screen , oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think .	ES2015d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
72.92	So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , and our Industrial Designer , Baba .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	play	[]	[Baba]	[User, Interface, Designer, David, Jordan, Industrial, Designer]
94.27	So we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control , and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
108.87	And in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	evaluate	[]	[]	[fabrica]
186.51	Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but keep on speaking .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
268.99	So we can call our remote control the mushroom .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
471.63	Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
788.45	So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	channel	[]	[]	[]
960.43	Fine to coarse .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	coarse	[]	[]	[]
1015.0	Nobody would take it .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1029.59	S maybe we can change from th 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1104.19	So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1141.17	So , just have a look at the okay here is the 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1172.06	Do you think one would be enough , or such as 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1213.04	Okay , just keep on going , just to have an idea .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1249.22	Push button .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	Push	[]	[]	[]
1390.46	And push button .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[]
1468.45	So yeah , you will have So one button , and s 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1519.21	But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1537.84	Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	innova	[]	[]	[]
1699.88	You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1757.2	It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T.V. with uh a a tr 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1850.47	Maybe what you can do a test .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1852.55	Put it outside , and if bees come , it's really fruit .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
1894.23	So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R. .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[R.]
1943.09	Try to .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	Try	[]	[]	[]
1992.91	I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
2038.58	Okay , I will close this .	IS1003d.A.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
2.65	So now that we've all had a bit of time to think about it , um does anyone have any concrete proposals or do we want to just 	IB4002.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
62.4	Yeah , give them like the most comfortable offices and 	IB4002.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
99.69	go through that first .	IB4002.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
217.65	'Cause they'll fight for the window .	IB4002.D.words.xml	fight	[]	[]	[]
224.18	If she's in there half the time , she can have her desk near the window , and okay , she's not near the mailbox , but 	IB4002.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
383.78	You'll meet him .	IB4002.D.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
392.31	make a list on here of who we have .	IB4002.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
399.55	keep talking .	IB4002.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
516.6	Would have to be here or the other three person room .	IB4002.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
523.73	Pick a room .	IB4002.D.words.xml	Pick	[]	[]	[]
589.68	That could work .	IB4002.D.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
694.71	But then we should split the little party up .	IB4002.D.words.xml	split	[]	[]	[]
733.26	See I would put it the other way .	IB4002.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
734.22	I would put the room with Martin in it in the two window room , 'cause he's fifty per cent , so then at least 	IB4002.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[Martin]
745.25	Put Martin in the three person room with two windows .	IB4002.D.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[Martin]
835.33	Know anything about yeah .	IB4002.D.words.xml	Know	[]	[]	[]
1013.48	switch no .	IB4002.D.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
1031.95	pick up your desktop and plus you can't assume that you can just use the reading room for reception hours .	IB4002.D.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
1096.63	Will you have .	IB4002.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1216.71	Do you get the photocopying noise .	IB4002.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1243.98	I should start start making full sentences .	IB4002.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1274.34	Pierrette should have a smaller office , 	IB4002.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Pierrette]
1613.1	No , they'll have to go down .	IB4002.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1679.19	As far as I know basically we pack up one day , the movers come , take all our stuff , put into the red boxes .	IB4002.D.words.xml	take	[one day]	[]	[]
1696.47	Make sure you label your boxes properly .	IB4002.D.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1715.52	Uh we can try .	IB4002.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1717.84	I can ask them .	IB4002.D.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1840.72	save this .	IB4002.D.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
511.09	I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay .	ES2005b.D.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
554.26	Okay and then how do I press the the big one , to get it on to the big 	ES2005b.D.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
568.18	Okay , so um I'm the interface design designer , User Interface Designer sorry , uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um I'm I'm also I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's a big concern of ours .	ES2005b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer]
701.97	hang on .	ES2005b.D.words.xml	hang	[]	[]	[]
1137.95	That might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries .	ES2005b.D.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[]
1401.67	Although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap .	ES2005b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1518.09	Glow in the dark material I was thinking .	ES2005b.D.words.xml	Glow	[]	[]	[]
1620.61	Well what about this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about um something that's built into the T.V. um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or something um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep .	ES2005b.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1710.71	That could also be built into the T.V. though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete .	ES2005b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[T.V.]
108.24	Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	slide	[]	[]	[]
116.33	Think that's better .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
199.88	Uh colour changeable , and also transparent .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	colour	[]	[]	[]
203.52	And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	colour	[]	[]	[]
632.54	We can put those here .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
690.88	Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
708.19	Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
713.26	So you can switch back from second to w first .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
741.78	Yeah mm nee uh No , if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1422.75	think that's a two or a one .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1449.42	Yeah , you could make a a front 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1519.18	But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1765.24	And make notes .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1903.9	But you might as well do it in normal computer style .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2188.2	Now we can look at this .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
2669.48	Fill in the questionnaire .	TS3004d.C.words.xml	Fill	[]	[]	[]
217.4	Draw .	TS3006a.D.words.xml	Draw	[]	[]	[]
284.81	Or so y you must save it at the end and then 	TS3006a.D.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
295.68	Okay , then m make a new one .	TS3006a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
501.61	How to select the next or here .	TS3006a.D.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
833.4	I mean , what functions do they have .	TS3006a.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
862.46	Um and we can interview current users and future users .	TS3006a.D.words.xml	interview	[]	[]	[]
1049.81	Better make it 	TS3006a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1104.54	So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video .	TS3006a.D.words.xml	switch	[]	[]	[]
1109.79	And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular .	TS3006a.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1115.13	And then use your Windows media centre under your T.V. with the same remote control .	TS3006a.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[Windows, T.V.]
433.36	And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
453.16	handset .	ES2013c.D.words.xml	handset	[]	[]	[]
552.78	you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy .	ES2013c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
572.42	Um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it .	ES2013c.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
581.83	They could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own .	ES2013c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
625.48	Y yeah , but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers .	ES2013c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
714.86	That would add 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
740.0	call it something that's fruit and veg 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
745.02	We could call it uh 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
777.4	And then we could keep it titanium .	ES2013c.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1719.46	To uh m make it .	ES2013c.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1803.01	Do you think with um 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1819.21	And have it abstract .	ES2013c.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1821.02	You know , we could call like a fruit name , but it would be a little more abstract .	ES2013c.D.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
2030.95	It could tie in with the fanciful design as uh , you know , throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving .	ES2013c.D.words.xml	tie	[]	[]	[]
2057.12	But I could market that as a um as a a I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know .	ES2013c.D.words.xml	market	[]	[]	[]
762.78	And um so you you can go 	IS1001c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
839.53	You ca uh you can go uh before , before , yes .	IS1001c.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
73.42	So , I will open our functional design meeting .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[]
78.84	So , I will play role of the secretary .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
85.45	So , we will have the three presentations from the 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
99.32	And after that we uh will have the 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
112.89	close the meetings after .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
356.37	Go on , go back and 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
370.14	So , you will propose us something which is 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	propose	[]	[]	[]
758.33	So just think of um the usability .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
764.13	Just think of the problem .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
991.08	And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1133.81	If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[]
1139.59	Yeah , it will cost little bit more .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[]
1233.58	new information about the product requirements , so you will have to 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1238.6	take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1269.47	So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , and also the remote control will only be used for television , so 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1301.66	to do remote control 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1303.94	which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
1320.67	So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1352.12	So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1381.2	Require lot of requirements , but 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	Require	[]	[]	[]
1473.4	Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1500.72	Think it's a re reaction remote control , so .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1543.14	I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
1549.78	And you will have in thirty minutes individual work .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1560.88	You will have as the I.D. I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[I.D., industr, Industrial, Designer, User, Interface, Designer]
1579.28	work my subject .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1600.55	And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder .	IS1003b.C.words.xml	record	[]	[]	[Mister, David, Jordan]
552.64	Do you think 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
604.36	By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international .	ES2015b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
685.31	Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design .	ES2015b.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
697.72	And less functions would have to be included .	ES2015b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
792.19	And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design .	ES2015b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
798.21	We'll have more money to go into the design side of it .	ES2015b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1091.14	And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up .	ES2015b.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1106.21	Like the internet you can send emails and You've no interaction .	ES2015b.C.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
1454.68	And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control .	ES2015b.C.words.xml	keep	[fifteen to twenty five year olds]	[]	[Euros]
1829.41	C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T.V. set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something .	ES2015b.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1911.6	I would go for 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2139.36	I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised .	ES2015b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2218.54	Y Could buy extra 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
612.59	I would try to share them with the women so uh for example in your slide I could uh switch either you or Martin with uh uh the other room .	IB4004.B.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[Martin]
689.32	So I mean , this is perfectly fine , I will just send Martin and Andrei for Maria or or Yalina or Nancy , maybe .	IB4004.B.words.xml	send	[]	[Yalina]	[Martin, Andrei, Maria, Nancy]
710.63	So I would change one , switch one .	IB4004.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1265.49	Let's put m Maria or Yalina in the in the in this place .	IB4004.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[Yalina]	[Maria]
69.71	copy .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	copy	[]	[]	[]
200.21	Uh can I have 	ES2005d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
551.17	Uh you can do one thing .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
556.77	Then move it with the help of this Okay .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	move	[]	[]	[]
570.83	Shift .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	Shift	[]	[]	[]
890.04	How mu What rating we will give to these products .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
900.82	So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
906.92	We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1125.29	So what do you think you will personally give .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1160.64	Uh d you can you can tell on on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[Interface, Expert]
1193.48	You will go for one .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1315.3	Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1344.56	because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1503.89	So they can play with it , it's quite good .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1506.2	So then I think , maybe I can give it two .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1600.84	So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
1627.2	Uh overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	round	[]	[]	[]
1638.99	So we can launch it .	ES2005d.B.words.xml	launch	[]	[]	[]
384.48	There go .	ES2007a.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
660.79	Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would 	ES2007a.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
669.64	roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe .	ES2007a.C.words.xml	incorporate	[]	[]	[]
899.43	Yeah , we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have .	ES2007a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
961.3	Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T.V. remote , and have it be um 	ES2007a.C.words.xml	concentrate	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1007.52	Yeah , rathe rather than focus on 	ES2007a.C.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
1167.89	Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap .	ES2007a.C.words.xml	seem	[]	[]	[]
633.33	Or combine uh both with a with one uh 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	combine	[]	[]	[]
664.26	And throw it .	TS3006c.B.words.xml	throw	[]	[]	[]
770.15	Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control .	TS3006c.B.words.xml	disable	[]	[]	[]
777.27	And only the the L.C.D. panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options .	TS3006c.B.words.xml	light	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
801.22	Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button .	TS3006c.B.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
855.18	So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people .	TS3006c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1100.33	Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with LEDs uh beneath the the buttons .	TS3006c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1218.33	Yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons .	TS3006c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1499.16	We we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse , with which you can change uh and so if you 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1616.76	If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , also for the for the more uh yeah for the people .	TS3006c.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1933.09	Yeah I I was think about a red uh red LEDs and blue LEDs and 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
2125.38	And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface .	TS3006c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2246.42	Yeah the display , we yeah we can put a display .	TS3006c.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2287.54	You can make it m larger .	TS3006c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2379.48	But why why do we need uh the flipping uh 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2549.0	Uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll , volume button .	TS3006c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
150.93	So now we we have the okay , so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there .	ES2006d.A.words.xml	explain	[]	[]	[Ma, Maarika]
311.11	Uh on the L.C.D. we r you know , the main menu will have various options .	ES2006d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
357.2	You can have a look .	ES2006d.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
580.87	But we can we can I can I can take note uh uh 	ES2006d.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
682.3	So you guys can decide wh whether 	ES2006d.A.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
699.34	Uh this this kind of uh makes it more and two , it might interfere with the I.R. channel .	ES2006d.A.words.xml	interfere	[]	[I.R.]	[]
1359.03	But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .	ES2006d.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
956.97	An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages .	ES2016b.B.words.xml	compose	[]	[]	[]
999.1	We'll start with an energy source .	ES2016b.B.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1316.68	go .	ES2016b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1984.65	Talk about maybe f look at that from the side , there maybe .	ES2016b.B.words.xml	Talk	[]	[]	[]
2004.63	if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down .	ES2016b.B.words.xml	add	[]	[]	[]
2014.32	Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here .	ES2016b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2038.16	You know what I'm getting at here , fel look at it from the side .	ES2016b.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[fel]
2068.93	You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open .	ES2016b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2301.4	Make it a piece of furniture .	ES2016b.B.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
170.08	Maybe a Spanish name would work well .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
225.57	And we could have some like you d you could have the fonts you know special , so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O. as like 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[O.]
566.87	Well it can still be a , you can still extend past the hand .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	extend	[]	[]	[]
598.6	You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything , but 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
734.76	You might have some background noise from the T.V. which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
781.92	Okay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe be easier to could I use the mouse , or 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	describe	[]	[]	[]
855.88	Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L.C.D. screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1055.43	Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1075.51	I I would if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1177.67	I think even that , I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L.C.D. screen , to implement , um but I think that would be quite useful as well .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	implement	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1204.7	Say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
1226.86	Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
1630.97	If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
1732.28	Like if we if we produce the T.V.s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T.V. to superimpose those those menus .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[T.V.s, T.V.]
1853.92	'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1888.85	You can get a lot more information on it .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1902.29	So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to .	IS1004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1908.88	You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
65.72	And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	reach	[]	[]	[]
135.74	So uh where to put what button .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
144.79	At the end , uh I will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	take	[the end of the minutes]	[]	[]
641.73	I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
646.16	Combine them .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	Combine	[]	[]	[]
792.8	Do your thing , Tim .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	Do	[]	[]	[Tim]
797.03	Bring it on .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	Bring	[]	[]	[]
983.48	Would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	prefer	[]	[]	[]
1046.36	Maybe you could use your remote as a phone .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1676.58	Yeah , maybe it can work with show view .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1678.49	Uh , you you can control your video recorder with show view .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[]
1682.44	Uh , when you tick in a number , it will uh start and end uh recording .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
1773.36	If we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2226.21	So , we must uh we must bring it as if uh Real Reaction is uh is big company , uh a trustful company , and uh it has m 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[Reaction]
2316.29	So uh maybe you can go to Paris and Milan uh once again .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[Paris, Milan]	[]
2368.18	So you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh But I think it was a very uh very good uh session , uh gentlemen .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
2379.65	I will thank you all .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	thank	[]	[]	[]
2384.93	Give me a good evaluation .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	Give	[]	[]	[]
2393.14	See you in a half hour .	TS3007c.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
2397.83	But keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
138.48	But uh let's see , introduce myself .	ES2008a.B.words.xml	introduce	[]	[]	[]
165.21	I will draw a little turtle for you all .	ES2008a.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
201.07	It's quite cool carry your home around where you go , um quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , um and they're easy to draw .	ES2008a.B.words.xml	swim	[]	[]	[]
240.19	No , you can erase the turtle , it's alright .	ES2008a.B.words.xml	erase	[]	[]	[]
638.34	Um , I think there is a way around that , but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T.V. itself , and I think that's if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing .	ES2008a.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[T.V.]
707.48	Could we get something that 	ES2008a.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
751.98	Yeah , and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day .	ES2008a.B.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
294.2	Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .	ES2004c.D.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
796.5	It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , i it's not gonna add anything , okay .	ES2004c.D.words.xml	detract	[]	[]	[]
1152.1	It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall .	ES2004c.D.words.xml	mark	[]	[]	[]
1159.44	I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .	ES2004c.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1334.49	Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to .	ES2004c.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1413.28	I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in .	ES2004c.D.words.xml	raise	[]	[]	[]
2156.44	Mm , so can I just recap uh Sarah , for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um L.C.D. display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic .	ES2004c.D.words.xml	recap	[]	[]	[Sarah, L.C.D.]
218.53	Could have one for your stereo , one for your D.V. player .	ES2012d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[D.V.]
310.0	Uh yeah , just click there .	ES2012d.D.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
542.86	Sure , uh can I get the 	ES2012d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
609.17	And then at the end just take an average 	ES2012d.D.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
637.67	So , look at these questions .	ES2012d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
734.48	Well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that .	ES2012d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
781.41	Uh , yeah and what h did we make the management's 	ES2012d.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
600.63	Check .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	Check	[]	[]	[]
754.52	use a lot of but batteries .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
765.38	And have to be somewhat like bigger 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
781.62	senden okay .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	senden	[]	[]	[]
806.14	Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
1100.08	With the L.C.D. screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint , and then you can use it again .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1195.48	Yeah , if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings , so the other buttons are gone .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	adjust	[]	[]	[]
1317.17	Yeah , okay , I'll I'll post it .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	post	[]	[]	[]
1331.73	Yeah , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
1339.13	Tha i l i it'll look fancy with L.C.D. screen .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[L.C.D.]	[]
1366.35	Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1507.7	Then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in a recharger .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1596.94	Plug it in , that's it .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	Plug	[]	[]	[]
1927.89	And if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
1951.02	They'd have to be easy to use .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1975.52	Uh play , pause , doesn't n need to be there .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1984.17	We could check the other remote controls with technical functions .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
2097.12	Would spend more money if it looks fancy .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	spend	[]	[]	[]
2263.99	Touch screen , yeah then it's turn turn off , turn on .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	turn	[]	[]	[]
2327.54	Yeah , but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	jump	[]	[]	[]
2354.28	Yeah , if we can afford it .	TS3005b.D.words.xml	afford	[]	[]	[]
274.34	Or browse .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	browse	[]	[]	[]
316.5	Also so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
367.94	It's a very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market , actually that's what it that it i and would cost us to build it about eight Euros .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	cost	[]	[]	[Euros]
513.34	I really can change it , so 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
521.0	The L.C.D. can display what is that on that , and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here , or in the button th here , so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
576.47	Design enter .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	enter	[]	[]	[]
670.2	Well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1048.8	Well I will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say you know .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1057.71	It though the look is fine but uh still I will give four in that case you know .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1249.29	And you might have a slight thing for to forward and 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1293.75	Say about that .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	Say	[]	[]	[]
1499.57	Oh no , this would I I would I would give this model to the old people actually .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1567.72	And people can still decide to use the cheaper one 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1663.4	The field test will tell you how good .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[]
1948.0	Yeah , it migh It it'll need uh more than a conventional one , it won't be uh just maybe you might use a A.A. battery actually .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	need	[]	[A.A.]	[]
2278.91	That'll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2353.54	Or we could even replace them by buttons actually .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	replace	[]	[]	[]
2362.87	A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you'll have L.C.D. display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
2488.66	That will create another problem .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
2491.11	For the people to use it .	IS1000d.D.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
274.82	Let's talk about money .	IS1006a.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
650.05	may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah .	IS1006a.A.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[ye]
757.33	uh the ones , make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want .	IS1006a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
778.65	So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes .	IS1006a.A.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[]
819.27	See you in thirty minutes .	IS1006a.A.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
27.06	Think s 	IS1002c.C.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
116.52	Prepare to die .	IS1002c.C.words.xml	Prepare	[]	[]	[]
565.64	That kinda would r d yeah .	IS1002c.C.words.xml	r	[]	[kinda]	[]
568.72	That would kind of lose it .	IS1002c.C.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
668.28	Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial .	IS1002c.C.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
1038.55	I'll bet first in volume maybe .	IS1002c.C.words.xml	bet	[]	[]	[]
1936.69	Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator .	IS1002c.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
1486.31	Yeah , we can take it from there .	TS3007a.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1487.8	Yeah , I agree uh , we can take it from there .	TS3007a.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1493.14	Or edit .	TS3007a.C.words.xml	edit	[]	[]	[]
573.88	Yeah , that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away .	ES2014c.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
894.63	I'll just just check what it said .	ES2014c.C.words.xml	check	[]	[]	[]
972.85	Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
983.7	And uh it was quite uh a swish model , where it can control uh four devices , T.V. , cable , satellite , video , D.V.D. , audio .	ES2014c.C.words.xml	control	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1036.88	There was children's remote , where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels .	ES2014c.C.words.xml	program	[]	[]	[]
1215.15	Um just to avoid ambiguity .	ES2014c.C.words.xml	avoid	[]	[]	[]
1219.42	So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a V. on for volume , 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1243.64	Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , and that's the first thing that they see 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1512.37	I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use .	ES2014c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1628.74	And that you can make them curved or double-curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look .	ES2014c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1653.99	And that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber .	ES2014c.C.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1756.61	Yeah and then you could have Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that .	ES2014c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1987.66	Um I'll show you 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
1993.71	See how uh 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1995.62	Let's just get that bigger .	ES2014c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2107.38	Yeah and and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it .	ES2014c.C.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2215.46	Uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple .	ES2014c.C.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
43.48	Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
62.34	So I'll put it in there .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
69.27	I'll do that next time .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
70.89	Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	act	[]	[]	[]
81.73	The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
556.1	increase the price .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	increase	[]	[]	[]
581.61	Okay , so do you want to 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
669.96	Should yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	wait	[]	[]	[]
902.83	If I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D.V.D. , I could get back to them and see .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1046.6	Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1050.17	Do you want to yeah .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1720.7	Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	imply	[fifteen to thirty five]	[]	[]
1801.67	Yeah , but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1816.63	and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1918.53	So that you can yell at it , yeah .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	yell	[]	[]	[]
1987.28	That's but then if you're buying the remote separately , but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T.V. or something , some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T.V. .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
2051.88	What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	complete	[]	[]	[]
2061.84	Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	Send	[]	[]	[]
2075.07	Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2087.1	So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2092.58	Yeah , and email them round .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	email	[]	[]	[]
2099.97	Oh yeah , put them in there .	ES2006b.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
164.28	Oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and uh 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
224.46	And you could also touch it so that it comes out , and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	touch	[]	[]	[]
261.56	Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
281.75	We can erase it , but It's the button where you can switch channels .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	erase	[]	[]	[]
285.71	just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
320.76	Or at least it should look like it .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
357.72	I will put it back on the on the nice green .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
479.93	Y you should make uh a sideways uh view .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
488.0	Oh g I would smart board .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	smart	[]	[]	[board]
493.84	Uh can I draw here or uh 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
587.64	I would make it a two or something .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
660.48	So you can use the b the the arrows .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
724.09	Yeah , you can make it a two .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
744.01	You can touch it .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	touch	[]	[]	[]
747.75	You you can touch options .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	touch	[]	[]	[]
756.65	You can touch options and it's comes out .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	touch	[]	[]	[]
851.2	I would make it two .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
920.69	Well but then when you scratch it it does come off .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
951.19	You can break it .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	break	[]	[]	[]
956.54	Y yeah , you could you could call it .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
966.72	Yeah , y you can lose it , but it isn't hard to lose .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
983.04	Yeah , you can lose it , so I don't you can make it a three I 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
987.84	It does have an a built in function .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1058.67	Let's make everything a two .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1081.47	You could call to your uh yeah , and the screen , yeah .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	call	[]	[]	[]
1198.03	And you can navigate easier , because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal T.V. uh remote .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	navigate	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1214.37	Let's make a different remote .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1321.05	Do you have the cost or uh 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1325.29	Let's hope .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1367.24	But you should uh direct 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	direct	[]	[]	[]
1392.69	I would do a battery we do .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1479.98	We could lose the curve .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
1483.54	Yeah , I would lose the curve .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
1590.52	We could make it titanium instead of rubber .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1624.78	See , a po three .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
1634.54	Make it uh 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	Make	[]	[]	[]
1658.79	Yeah , you can , you should you have to lose 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1729.58	You co you could make it always black , like normal remote .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1739.64	Yeah , we should u Yeah .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	u	[]	[]	[]
1793.58	And make it uh 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1803.66	Perhaps you can then copy page or so .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	copy	[]	[]	[]
1829.71	By the Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
1834.94	Add it copy page .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	Add	[]	[]	[]
1839.05	Select all .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	Select	[]	[]	[]
1856.7	Let's forget .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1866.59	Oh ignore that .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	ignore	[]	[]	[]
1896.73	So we could fix it like tha that it's like this .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	fix	[]	[]	[]
1901.39	You could select it all , but then you can't erase .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
1930.14	Just tap somewhere .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	tap	[]	[]	[]
2103.56	Yeah , but then you can work together too when 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
2127.78	It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
2160.28	Yeah , you can point to where you want the line to be .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	point	[]	[]	[]
2210.57	Yeah , I used it to y to Yeah , it did work pretty well .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
2225.88	Yeah , and then you can show it to everybody .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
2368.62	Yea uh so tha actually you could make an L.C.D. screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L.C.D. screen , when you look at that .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[L.C.D.]	[L.C.D.]
2384.17	Think that's about it .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
2520.78	But you can make a screen shot , I think .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2577.56	You can only save it in my documents .	TS3005d.B.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
51.43	Let's see if that comes up .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
75.79	Let's start .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
77.3	Okay , our agenda today um just check the time , it's twelve thirteen .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	check	[today]	[]	[]
91.53	So um then I we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
97.59	Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	talk	[]	[]	[]
114.57	Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
130.83	Okay , three presentations , um you can go in any order you choose um .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
138.15	Sure , please do .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
247.84	Press the little presentation .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	Press	[]	[]	[]
1008.42	You just press yeah , just click .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1091.75	Um yeah use that thing you can go back , previous .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1107.22	Double click on it .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1422.36	Like , we can we can play around with it a little bit .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	play	[]	[]	[]
1561.67	To produce it , yes .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	produce	[]	[]	[]
1610.98	Well , we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user-friendly .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1650.25	Kind of pull out of the side .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	pull	[]	[]	[]
1893.05	So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because , yeah , things so different will appeal to different people , but 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	appeal	[]	[]	[]
2020.87	Okay , do it .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2044.57	Yeah , I would imagine .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	imagine	[]	[]	[]
2086.63	Think it's 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
2104.59	Um and then we'll have our lunch break .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2109.24	Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
2114.45	If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
2130.23	And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2226.17	Well I'll figure that out in the meantime .	ES2008b.A.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
88.67	I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
93.86	Um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
103.95	And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
112.7	I'll go through the mee through the minutes first .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[mee]
188.05	And that it should look different than what's out there .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
266.3	Um we would just have a T.V. remote .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
269.36	Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	focus	[]	[]	[]
289.7	Um from energy source , um uh what we would use .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
300.65	How that would power the remote and the lamp .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	power	[]	[]	[]
306.91	Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T.V. .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	connect	[]	[]	[T.V.]
349.91	Okay and I will leave that , leave it at that .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
586.69	So possibly like a uh , sorry , just to butt in for a second .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	butt	[]	[]	[]
603.27	feel to it .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
619.97	We could leave that to the cover department .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
1792.16	I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1834.79	We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
1839.42	It would look like a banana just sitting on their table .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1862.64	Hey we could have a variety of options here .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2008.72	And what kind of supplements we'll have .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2056.55	then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2060.28	We could have a complex one or a a non-complex .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2218.62	Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2246.4	Corrine we'll want a product evaluation .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2259.61	maybe and and get us a prototype .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2264.37	Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2267.63	So that basically just be working on the prototype , uh we'll accomplish your other two actions .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	accomplish	[]	[]	[]
2301.71	Let's do it .	ES2016c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
68.58	uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	open	[]	[]	[Smartboard]
110.26	Uh we'll do the opening and then uh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
113.91	we'll meet each other , what uh we already do , so , that's not uh very much trouble .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	meet	[]	[]	[]
119.18	I'll I'll show you the 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
121.44	the tools we have here , so that we can all use them .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
125.33	Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
131.53	We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then uh we'll close the meeting , and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
167.46	And uh friendly , so size does matter .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	matter	[]	[]	[]
186.84	There happen to be uh three stages .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	happen	[]	[]	[]
194.69	Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
222.87	You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
228.9	So you can uh make uh Words Excel , everything .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Excel]
232.77	Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
271.87	Yes I will eraser so .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	eraser	[]	[]	[]
278.38	We can uh uh well you can save a file .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
286.72	Uh just we can start a new one , 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
296.42	We can delete , but we don't do that .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	delete	[]	[]	[]
298.55	Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
383.75	Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose , loosen up , a bit uh meeting each other well uh uh nice yeah .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	loosen	[]	[]	[]
408.45	Yes yes guess .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	guess	[]	[]	[]
410.89	Well I should make it an hippo now .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
503.24	and start a new black uh doc a blank document .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[]
512.13	and then save it and start an blank document .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
533.04	So um well you should uh try it but uh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
539.01	Well y y y you could have but uh .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
586.38	Well uh save the document and then uh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
597.16	uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
623.32	And you can choose a nice one .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
651.12	And erase things .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	erase	[]	[]	[]
700.32	Yeah save it and start a new blank document .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
754.92	we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	keep	[twelve and a half]	[]	[]
771.46	Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first about design uh about uh aim in the market 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[]
787.84	Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	sit	[]	[]	[]
793.04	We can uh take notes and uh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
882.11	I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
988.89	Oo 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	Oo	[]	[]	[]
992.27	N we can use uh it as a as a game pad .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1048.38	I have uh have to it has to fit my hands .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1068.56	Tho tho those new D.V.D. players on the market do have those .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1203.24	Sound nice .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	Sound	[]	[]	[]
1246.1	So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1302.1	But y you can have uh of course different between D.V.D.s and televisions and between 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	have	[between D.V.D.s]	[]	[]
1348.05	Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them uh when you buy the 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1355.28	And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	dispatch	[]	[]	[]
1415.09	But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	ask	[]	[]	[]
1435.66	And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1474.82	I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh because uh it's it's the half of the normal size .	TS3009a.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
83.11	Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point .	IS1004c.A.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
364.57	So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L.C.D. .	IS1004c.A.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
561.11	Well , you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not .	IS1004c.A.words.xml	tell	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert]
622.96	Okay , I'll give the floor .	IS1004c.A.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
636.34	Go for it .	IS1004c.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
856.58	So if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
908.38	But you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
1058.04	Switch on .	IS1004c.A.words.xml	Switch	[]	[]	[]
1103.88	to comman co communicate , it's just a thing 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	communicate	[]	[]	[co]
1779.09	If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana .	IS1004c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1831.37	Let's move on .	IS1004c.A.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1840.27	Go for it .	IS1004c.A.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1977.76	We'll have a base station extra uh on the side .	IS1004c.A.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2144.1	So , okay , the next step , you can come back to your seat .	IS1004c.A.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
2215.8	Yeah , maybe , for the n if if if it it works well , we'll go for uh an orange one .	IS1004c.A.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2222.51	Yeah yeah , honour the fruit .	IS1004c.A.words.xml	honour	[]	[]	[]
499.12	Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller .	ES2006a.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1277.69	See you .	ES2006a.D.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
53.66	So the goal for today is to decide for a movie to project at the end of the month , so for this month of of April , and also discuss the content for an adver advertising posters and um I I will present you three des different design , we'll discuss it .	IB4011.D.words.xml	discuss	[today, the end of the month, this month of of April]	[]	[]
366.26	Voted for it , and I think only two other mov uh no , f three other movies uh have uh have more votes .	IB4011.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
519.57	We can have a look .	IB4011.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
684.95	And to remember maybe , or 	IB4011.D.words.xml	remember	[]	[]	[]
1075.0	Yeah , to sue him afterward .	IB4011.D.words.xml	sue	[]	[]	[]
1201.08	Okay , Andrei , yeah , can can you comment your 	IB4011.D.words.xml	comment	[]	[]	[Andrei]
1352.47	To realise how it wa how it was exactly .	IB4011.D.words.xml	realise	[]	[]	[]
1415.9	To make it like uh an historical movie or 	IB4011.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1571.23	Or or we have you have 	IB4011.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1581.6	y any of you have uh read the document I prepared on The Big Lebowski .	IB4011.D.words.xml	read	[]	[]	[Big, Lebowski]
1760.05	I'm going to actually I want to show you some posters I prepared for this movie , so we actually can discuss at the same time the poster design .	IB4011.D.words.xml	discuss	[]	[]	[]
1887.23	But then the problem I preferred the first one , because I think it's important to have the plot of movie , e especially for uh a movie people don't n never heard about it .	IB4011.D.words.xml	e	[]	[]	[]
1915.42	Okay , I'll try to do something , but first anyway we have to select a movie .	IB4011.D.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
1919.38	So I'll put all the information and you want me to put the at the bottom , all the information about the committee and the the Montreux Club , okay .	IB4011.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[Montreux, Club]
2036.56	maybe each of us can s can select two movies or 	IB4011.D.words.xml	select	[]	[]	[]
2108.02	Um no , actually I'm happy with the choices , because I really I would really push uh American Beauty , because I think it's uh it's an easy movie to watch and and still there are a lot of things to think afterward .	IB4011.D.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[American, Beauty]
2142.21	Okay , start , Andrei .	IB4011.D.words.xml	start	[]	[]	[Andrei]
2257.0	That takes a bit more time , but if you c if all of you can send me one image , I can make something on the left .	IB4011.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2263.95	Select one image from the movie and uh 	IB4011.D.words.xml	Select	[]	[]	[]
2274.45	No but I'll make something .	IB4011.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
420.76	Let's make it uh black .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
606.09	We could make a little R. and R. on the top of the machine .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[R., R.]
628.4	in which people will find they're uh interesting .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
631.13	And uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[]
905.71	Go Danny , go Danny .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[Danny, Danny]
1160.8	Will recognise that's as a remote control .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	recognise	[]	[]	[]
1185.11	Let's put it all together .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1345.64	Because when you put your f Yeah but if yo if you make the the L.C.D. screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll you'll always get some You Yeah .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1381.92	Zoom opt Ah yeah of course , yeah .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	opt	[]	[]	[]
1383.67	You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1417.27	Yeah You can do whatever uh any uh cloth .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1612.76	to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1642.29	Yeah sure , look .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1850.89	Take your time .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	Take	[]	[]	[]
1881.8	We'll leave that to the usability engineering then .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
1974.62	Let's cut to the chase .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
2110.28	Well put it there .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2156.39	Use the scroll .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
2177.49	You have a lot of options , because when you use Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	scroll	[]	[]	[]
2200.5	Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
2233.38	I I You got you got different colours , but you should have a standard colour .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2325.68	Look .	TS3005c.C.words.xml	Look	[]	[]	[]
1097.91	I'll give it another go .	ES2014b.D.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1122.88	And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T.V. 	ES2014b.D.words.xml	state	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1134.73	Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control .	ES2014b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1218.55	And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it .	ES2014b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1244.63	Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said .	ES2014b.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[Louisa]
1258.64	Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L.C.D. menu for other functions on the remote control .	ES2014b.D.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[L.C.D.]
1268.38	Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because um sort of young people are 	ES2014b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1287.25	And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels .	ES2014b.D.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[recogniti]
1299.63	'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel .	ES2014b.D.words.xml	end	[]	[]	[]
1361.22	Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but 	ES2014b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1813.69	I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together .	ES2014b.D.words.xml	press	[]	[]	[]
1848.69	Uh we could possibly put an L. a sort of a L.C.D. menu in , but that again is probably an expense that 	ES2014b.D.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[L., L.C.D.]
100.93	I'll show .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	show	[]	[]	[]
102.0	Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and I'll I'll show you the presentation .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	wanna	[]	[]	[]
108.3	Can I just nick your 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	nick	[]	[]	[]
144.53	And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
165.55	This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
204.26	how do you say , it's yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	close	[]	[]	[]
217.71	And working on the inside we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	attach	[]	[]	[]
252.72	So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
259.11	it'll shout back , I'm here , or something .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	shout	[]	[]	[]
269.55	It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	shout	[]	[]	[]
281.57	You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
291.74	Um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P.C.B.s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
359.3	uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	contain	[]	[]	[vo]
380.61	And now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
638.7	Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah , two or three .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
686.39	I'd give it a one .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
803.4	No , no , the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue , but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	allow	[]	[]	[]
838.01	Yeah , I'll give it a one as well .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
905.59	Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , 'cause 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
977.66	I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , but 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	realise	[]	[]	[]
1397.52	No , we'll have 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1412.79	And then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1436.48	Yeah , the standard , it um it would make one difference .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1468.69	If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1567.94	That'll do it .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1637.76	'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1701.17	Find out from each other , yeah .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	Find	[]	[]	[]
1821.29	Discuss which ones yeah .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	Discuss	[]	[]	[]
1952.22	Yeah , just jazz it up a bit .	ES2004d.C.words.xml	jazz	[]	[]	[]
961.3	So I would market this product it at eighty-nine Euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th but but I don't think we have that flexibility .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	market	[]	[]	[Euros]
1010.16	So that's just my question , but we can keep talking .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1139.78	So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something uh and and so so um But this 's just something .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
1219.91	Maybe make it in the form of a gun .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1221.21	We can sell it in United States .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	sell	[]	[United States]	[]
1270.43	Go go .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	Go	[]	[]	[]
1364.34	I I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way , so maybe we can have some I I talked about environmentally sensitive , uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1424.7	If if we could have a technological something 	IS1002b.D.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1506.65	But boy , we can sell this thing , because there's no batteries , it's environmentally sensitive , i we can identify it as a safer product in some form .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
1567.01	Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1574.12	Just make this thing uh , yeah , the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[Rolls, Royce]
1871.22	In a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen , nineteen Euro , and that's for the multi-functions , uh D.V.D. , V.C.R. , uh catch-alls .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	buy	[]	[]	[Euro, D.V.D., V.C.R.]
1891.81	So to me , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	market	[]	[]	[]
2055.14	Have a modern , have a traditional , have a you know , and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
2144.11	I'll sell whatever you guys design .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	sell	[]	[]	[]
2150.83	Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	find	[]	[]	[]
2250.88	And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
2289.4	uh we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
2336.89	Oh look it here .	IS1002b.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
270.81	Uh m m i uh i yeah but the p sort of start and end times will give you back to that output .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
280.89	A as a and then you just measure it against , you know , the c the c yeah , the cumulative total time record or something .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	measure	[]	[]	[]
364.25	Th th th yeah , the it should still come out that the little sketch I asked this p for for last week about N.X.T. and whether it would have that sort of tiered effect so you could see the overlap of where one person is looking compared to the other and their mouse movements and things .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	come	[last week]	[]	[N.X.T.]
379.65	That that should ra uh address all that .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	address	[]	[]	[ra]
398.01	So I did have it somewhere .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
613.26	And then we can just take that chunk out and do something with it .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
1262.29	You can we can announce now .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	announce	[]	[]	[]
1374.31	Bi um yeah , with some some measure of the so we could work out the number of fixations that made and the average fixation duration as well .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	work	[]	[]	[]
1444.86	Put the actual location 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
1491.26	Uh it it yes , it can do , but it's also looking at it within their their own behaviour to see , yeah .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1601.93	Uh well , if you've got the number of fixations in the average time , you can then just generate it .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	generate	[]	[]	[]
1659.64	Uh that it can vary a bit depending on the calibration .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	vary	[]	[]	[]
1670.79	'Cause I'm trying to think that it's probably the small the actual mouse icon is so small , it'll need a slightly larger uh just because if what you have i is a sort of larger error or of b error margin around it .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	need	[]	[]	[]
2421.11	You can build sub sub-assemblies and then link the the part really , yeah .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	build	[]	[]	[]
2533.22	Construct .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	Construct	[]	[]	[]
2659.4	They ca they can appear without them .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	appear	[]	[]	[]
2857.48	No , so they they can have different uh nuts there .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
3333.68	No , they could just make a mistake or screw up , yeah .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
3423.76	we should should go back to the beginning .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
3471.27	There will now have to be two Camtasia records because uh e each person actually sees a different screen because of the gaze feedback .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[Camtasia]	[]
3481.6	So there'll need to be two separate Camtasia videos generated .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	need	[]	[Camtasia]	[]
3520.82	Suppose technically we should have two because it'll be two machines .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	Suppose	[]	[]	[]
3527.16	It'll be per machine I would think .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
3532.73	I I'll have a uh yeah , I'll have a l a look at the actual Camtasia licence .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[Camtasia]	[]
3692.05	See how how long it took them actually .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
3694.9	How long did it take them to calibrate .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	take	[]	[]	[]
3727.81	'Cause only one of the uh Camtasia videos will actually have the soundtrack .	EN2009d.C.words.xml	have	[]	[Camtasia]	[]
368.94	Think so .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
625.1	Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	integrate	[]	[]	[]
632.08	That would cut the cost .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	cut	[]	[]	[]
961.46	That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	bring	[]	[]	[]
1049.8	Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , and teletext disappears .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	think	[eight eight eight]	[]	[]
1069.64	Well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	click	[]	[]	[]
1380.97	I'd rather just go to the board and 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1384.9	get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1389.28	Or do some market research and see what the options are .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	do	[]	[]	[]
1459.59	This will really require a lot of marketing 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	require	[]	[]	[]
1463.22	to get this to sell .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1615.84	The shape , look and feel .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	look	[]	[]	[]
1664.23	Let's see .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	Let	[]	[]	[]
1735.79	I'd go for four , too .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1773.01	Think we do .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
1986.76	Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	Think	[]	[]	[]
2040.02	get something of your own .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
2382.45	So maybe we should just re-focus .	TS3003d.D.words.xml	re	[]	[]	[]
463.79	I'll try to draw elephant .	IS1004a.C.words.xml	try	[]	[]	[]
531.24	When they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there .	IS1004a.C.words.xml	come	[]	[]	[]
253.36	You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T.V. .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[T.V.]
259.51	Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R.S.I. from the remote thing , 'cause that's just 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	stop	[]	[]	[]
352.89	Yeah , you'll understand why when we get to my presenta .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	understand	[]	[]	[]
624.88	No it's got its little camera in there , plug it in .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	plug	[]	[]	[]
946.17	Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A. to Z. of your music and you're looking for something at T. , then it's a lot faster than the wheel , but you've got a lot less control over it .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[Z., T.]
1165.98	And if you get the number in wrong , then it's a bit of a pain , so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	cut	[]	[]	[]
1173.7	But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	tend	[]	[]	[]
1204.91	So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
1332.0	If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , you could just bounce it up and down .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[kinetic, energy]
1433.61	Uh combine style with a level of functionality , um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	combine	[]	[]	[]
1641.57	G yeah , I would think buttons , yeah .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
1645.68	It's it's the I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T.V. and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T.V. and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , but , you know , I mean most of the time I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T.V. , I think is the the the issue there .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V., T.V.]
1826.51	So you could have like I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	pick	[]	[]	[]
1980.22	Sorry , do you want me to 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
2076.98	Imagine it would be inside .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	Imagine	[]	[]	[]
2079.3	So um actually that could like really cut down your thing , so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into .	ES2006c.B.words.xml	cut	[]	[]	[]
408.76	Oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and it'd beep .	ES2016a.C.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
677.74	I'd I could draw sorta the ball idea .	ES2016a.C.words.xml	draw	[]	[]	[]
699.56	this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle 	ES2016a.C.words.xml	fol	[]	[]	[]
713.35	If that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you'd have 	ES2016a.C.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
922.18	I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like uh I suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier .	ES2016a.C.words.xml	design	[]	[]	[]
1170.12	But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then .	ES2016a.C.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[th]
1297.74	Put it 	ES2016a.C.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
11.56	Put on your mic .	IS1002d.B.words.xml	Put	[]	[]	[]
91.3	Pedro can have it .	IS1002d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[Pedro]
96.39	I like I'll help talk .	IS1002d.B.words.xml	help	[]	[]	[]
168.05	So here I'll give you the so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself .	IS1002d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
253.44	You can feel it .	IS1002d.B.words.xml	feel	[]	[]	[]
294.23	Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability .	IS1002d.B.words.xml	demonstrate	[]	[]	[Mm, Pedro]
368.12	So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , but 	IS1002d.B.words.xml	tweak	[]	[]	[]
388.84	So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people .	IS1002d.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[]	[]
843.7	Yeah um I do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , so there may have been a m miscalculation in there .	IS1002d.B.words.xml	think	[]	[]	[]
885.83	See it's a little bit more than f single-curved .	IS1002d.B.words.xml	See	[]	[]	[]
901.35	What do you know .	IS1002d.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
117.11	Yeah , yeah , we might get a 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
214.76	Yes , we'll have the slide-away .	ES2014d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
411.8	Have a push button interface .	ES2014d.B.words.xml	Have	[]	[]	[]
450.31	And then we'd have 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
610.77	Just give us a bit of 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
648.12	We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
664.0	So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition without 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
698.97	We should Yeah , that would save us one , though we'd still be slightly ov 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[]
719.36	Um , whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have .	ES2014d.B.words.xml	figure	[]	[]	[]
1424.58	So should we get So are definite Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has .	ES2014d.B.words.xml	get	[]	[]	[]
1454.69	Yeah , yeah we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going .	ES2014d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1502.72	So that's eleven point seven , and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements .	ES2014d.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1522.32	And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations .	ES2014d.B.words.xml	allow	[]	[]	[]
1524.43	So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	lose	[]	[]	[]
1658.97	So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	decide	[]	[]	[]
1818.07	to use .	ES2014d.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2004.84	Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and um , fit the kind of idea of what they want .	ES2014d.B.words.xml	fit	[]	[]	[]
2353.76	We should just go through this quickly and then 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2546.54	Like uh , companies can have like a range of products and 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[]
2682.35	Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way .	ES2014d.B.words.xml	put	[]	[]	[]
997.6	Yes , I can go ahead .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
1053.96	And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult , so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1083.74	And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen , but s I don't know in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything , but uh we might uh consider that .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1104.05	If you you can use remote like this with all the functions , 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1131.12	So just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1143.41	Um well this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but um it's no longer uh applying .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	create	[]	[]	[]
1193.34	Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought , or do we want to use um many buttons .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	want	[]	[]	[]
1252.47	'Cause if you use a memory display on the T.V. , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	push	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1262.14	Uh so that's my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , um display the menu on the T.V. and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1325.31	well yeah , the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today , um you should keep it s at this .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	keep	[today]	[]	[]
1331.7	Use big clear buttons .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	Use	[]	[]	[]
1336.07	So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options , but I think i this is more important .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	loose	[]	[]	[]
1344.9	especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	change	[]	[]	[]
1373.06	Um , well yeah , as you already told , give some feedback .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	give	[]	[]	[]
1376.68	If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	know	[]	[]	[]
1385.24	And um , well , my conclusion is uh is uh less is more , keep it simple .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1392.04	So uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the the television , some you you'll never know uh and never use , and therefore it's uh important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	ease	[]	[]	[]
1492.1	Um keep the primary buttons visible .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	keep	[]	[]	[]
1495.16	Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1505.51	But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	become	[]	[]	[]
1520.3	like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	expand	[]	[]	[]
1541.6	The extra functions , you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , and then all all the options will become available and you just c s yeah t scroll through them .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	choose	[]	[]	[]
1584.21	use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1620.08	Okay , I agree , but I think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
1632.27	And so um an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T.V. or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	have	[]	[]	[T.V.]
1709.3	Well , I think that he means that um maybe by some option uh make sure that um remote control and the T.V. match , and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh change the settings of the T.V. , like colour and then volume and uh 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
1755.31	Well b but make it a separate option in the menu , so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh displayed here , so uh parents uh 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	make	[]	[]	[]
1816.26	Yeah , you can de display it on the on the old style .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
1819.24	You can display actual buttons on the touch screens .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	display	[]	[]	[]
1970.65	Well you can use um when you uh how do you call it , s um synchronized , the um remote and the T.V. , then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T.V. it is , from ah , it's a Philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[T.V., Philips]
2171.72	Well , at uh you can go back to the shop and uh they 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	go	[]	[]	[]
2176.5	Yeah , ser o and they can download it for you .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	download	[]	[]	[]
2188.25	Well already digital information is sent t to the the standards , T.V. uh connections , you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels , so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard T.V. uh 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	send	[]	[]	[T.V., T.V.]
2301.58	Break it , I don't get 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	Break	[]	[]	[]
2406.55	'Kay , save it as an image on the res 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	save	[]	[]	[Kay]
2420.0	No , and use an image if possible .	TS3007b.B.words.xml	use	[]	[]	[]
2471.98	The questionnaire , fill in uh we fill out d after lunch or uh 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	fill	[]	[]	[]
2488.87	We can leave the P.C. on I think , yeah and return to the 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	leave	[]	[P.C.]	[]
