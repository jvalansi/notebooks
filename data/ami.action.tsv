64.47	Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
99.75	Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . But uh 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[dec]
110.82	Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
132.31	Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , and I'll have a look if Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
159.54	And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . Uh 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
175.7	Um now I'll look at show this board . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
204.76	we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls . We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . Uh not too many one buttons . One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
275.12	Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . I got this mail 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
332.75	Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
580.56	It should actually uh It should actually be loose from the television , because it can also be used for other televisions . So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . No you can click it on your television . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
612.92	Well we'll have a look at it , yeah . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
682.72	Well we are a design team , we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
844.76	Yes . Well go ahead . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
901.82	Click . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1115.52	No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1122.21	reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R, _, _, _]
1219.01	Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mike]
1233.18	Well then we have still the time , so But we do have to come to a decision , right later on . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1370.45	make someone w 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1479.92	Well what if we um I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , a f a little uh You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1547.14	Yeah . Well maybe w we could uh s On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . Yeah . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[lo, sta]
1828.05	Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1859.82	Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design . Because we have to decide this . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2086.34	Well the L_C_D_ . Um you are Industrial , you are User Interface . So I think it's going to go to Mike . But you will have to make consensus with . Well 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Mike]
2222.71	We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2226.14	And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting . Uh there's um screen . You can make it wider and less wide . And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[A_V]
2292.83	Go to video , that's always on your remote control . To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[A_V, A_V, _, A_V, A_V]
2327.43	No you can ch push zero . Yeah . Yeah , I I think that one button is uh I use it uh 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2401.14	Yes see . 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2433.66	Well see you uh W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh 	TS3009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
17.62	get this . 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
34.35	Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
62.05	Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
74.54	Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
319.35	Would you like to uh 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
452.31	I think it's definitely different than anything else out there . So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely . It's bright . 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
540.88	I would say 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
664.4	I'd say two . 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
724.89	Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
786.45	If we added the screaming factor then we go up . Um I would say we're probably at four . 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
935.07	Okay . Well , let's see . 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
982.45	Well let's see . The f the 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
985.78	Wonder if I can make this 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1282.72	Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote . 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1348.11	Let's see here . 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1369.43	I'd like to hear your thoughts . 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1419.97	think we tried a lotta different things and um 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1482.84	Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . That's it . 	ES2016d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
28.45	So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . Um So here is the agenda for today . Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . And we'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts . Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro . Okay . So let's go . Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[Euro]
127.89	let this uh wonderful thing . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
158.66	Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
258.58	To navigate it through th through teletext . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
815.21	Uh for a remote control , does he have all the 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
820.69	you could expect . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
931.85	Of course I'll buy the banana . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1143.28	So and last question , will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mando]
1163.16	No uh let's say I'll put two . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1222.69	Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1242.17	So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . We can had uh have a out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1263.2	Okay . So let's move uh let's move on . Okay , now now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost okay . So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet . Um well we are going to calculate the production costs . We should we should be below twelve point five . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm, Excel, Excel]
1318.87	Oh yeah finally we say no . Okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines . So hand dynamo . This something we didn't thought about . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1366.71	Let's go ahead . So we we st only have one for battery . Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[st]
1401.78	Okay so I'll remove it . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1421.39	Yeah maybe . We'll see later . Okay so in for the case um 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1463.67	Yeah so let's put one here in the then instead of single oka all right . So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1608.19	So mayb in fact n we have to put two here 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1643.59	Um we'll invest in R_ and D_ . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D]
1648.44	Yeah . So well we're under the the the cost . So we can go to through to project evaluation . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1672.12	Which is different . Which is different . None of us will buy it . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1772.02	Yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1780.72	So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1785.38	in the streets like asking to young peoples well , do you like to have a banana as a remote control . 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1917.16	home . Yeah . Maybe maybe we can hassle the the 	IS1004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
274.84	Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer . According to the drawings . Okay . 	IS1006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer]
494.26	Just to hold it . 	IS1006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
612.93	I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a 	IS1006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
619.46	like three mental states , yeah you know what I mean , we can just make it uh 	IS1006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
659.68	But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . 	IS1006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
683.14	I usually just change channels . 	IS1006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
61.32	Okay . Lovely to see you all again . Um it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . Um okay our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
126.98	Okay , now three presentations . I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
508.53	Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um underneath our oh , uh in your book , then don't worry about that . 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
929.78	I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . Um and so like favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . Like I I know I use that often enough . 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1259.84	Okay , do we have any s some questions for this , let's see um . 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1285.94	It's kind of and then it we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , I dunno . But 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1410.86	They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other . 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1524.11	continue with my pres presentation . Um I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1695.44	Um okay , then we'll move on to the case . 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1827.4	Okay , let's do case . 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1871.89	Okay . So we uh we do want latex . 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1886.36	Fruity colours . Okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose . 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ufe]
1940.94	And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . I think that yeah . For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I dunno . 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
2047.12	Well , but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through . 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2060.11	Mm-hmm . Okay , um finishing the meeting now . Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach . 	ES2008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
555.88	Remember you use uh different colours , and different pen widths . 	TS3007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
573.22	Save it . 	TS3007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
806.31	Think you uh picked the wrong uh function . 	TS3007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
936.57	It will do . 	TS3007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
956.87	Let's go on then . 	TS3007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1103.99	Yeah . Yeah , I can find Uh . 	TS3007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1230.05	Maybe it's easy . It's nice as an added feature feature , that um , when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or 	TS3007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1277.38	Look , you got some cheap uh remote controls there . 	TS3007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1292.34	uh wanna gain market share 	TS3007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1391.04	make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . And and then we can plan 	TS3007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1400.84	We can plan further , I think . 	TS3007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1391.97	So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional . And second , there should be some technological innovation . And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . 	ES2014c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1438.42	we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap . And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority , so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed . And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations . 	ES2014c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
1468.77	So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow . Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic . And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of a banana or something like that . 	ES2014c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1926.57	like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that 	ES2014c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2008.91	That should come up . 	ES2014c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
52.42	Remember , I'm an old man . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
346.22	And if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand . You don't even need to lean down to get it . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
734.72	See what it looks like . It's been so long . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
825.64	Uh I say that it's different I what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
847.16	What i if when when we have yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's as as a marketing standard I need something to market , to make this product unique . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
879.28	Mm 'kay . Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here . And and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
922.44	So I need a product . I need a product to market . And I just whatever product you guys put together , we'll find a way to market it . Tha that I'm not concerned with . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Tha]
1086.91	Yep . I think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now , and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1264.58	Again . Well I think it's it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , I believe , for me to market . Uh again the push-buttons I I see are are everywhere . And so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1290.68	Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1416.93	Or maybe you can like have a a smell-o-rama , you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink . You can 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[rama]
1596.97	But if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay . So I can go uh presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1647.15	Oh no we could read it from the television . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1661.75	Yeah the the television can tell you . Can . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1670.38	Put 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1807.7	That's what I mean . We can increase the cost . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1827.85	Well I think th I think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit . 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2001.89	You guys you guys can uh create a 	IS1002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
33.78	Uh , we should save that one . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
39.07	Yeah , save in the folder . Save as project . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
119.81	Get up stand up . just 'Kay . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
128.48	View . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
198.57	and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera . So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see oh , it's here , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible . Um 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
264.16	A sign , yeah , just like Okay , indeed . Okay , we can uh modify that later . Okay . Would you like to make any comments about next uh 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
323.77	Okay . You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very uh when you uh when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
496.11	Suppose so . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
680.0	Take a harder look , yeah , sure . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]

1115.69	Remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . Turn uh turn up the volume . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1199.4	Yeah , you can navigate . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1249.0	Save . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1372.19	Count it . You got Excel to count . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Excel]
1377.52	Oh okay . Well I dra uh Danny , Danny , I'll do that , because I draw the uh 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[dra, Danny, Danny]
1420.16	Single nee single curved . Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . But it isn't three dimensional , it isn't curved in a l 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1483.69	We could lose the scroll wheel . You could make it just a regular scroll wheel . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1503.55	Lose 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1610.82	To knock the sample speaker , yeah . And sample sensor . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1616.43	But m yeah , course , but What we'll have . Let's make it thirteen or fourteen . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1678.83	then it's possible to make . And then you can and then you can add to the colours . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1692.68	You lose this one , you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[spec]
2013.39	No , add 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2129.45	Yeah , perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there . So you can draw uh see it over th on the screen . Yeah . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2221.4	To make some designs , it is very easy . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2227.47	But to write it th yeah . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2327.72	Make a r yeah . 	TS3005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
581.48	Yeah . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue okay , yeah . 	ES2006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
679.62	Okay , let's start from the beginning . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up . Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . Um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . 	ES2006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
738.52	And yeah , and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words . Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um um I als okay . 	ES2006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1711.56	Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , because actually I mean they're all still re young people . Yeah . 	ES2006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2098.98	Oh so so we'll just put them i there , we we yeah , w we won't even okay . 	ES2006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2160.15	To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good . 	ES2006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
231.61	I'll try and draw my favourite animal . 	ES2008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
239.09	I'll I should leave that one on there shouldn't I before I callously rub it off . 	ES2008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
573.0	I find them they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um . 	ES2008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, digital]
588.15	And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume . 	ES2008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
783.99	Can I ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television 	ES2008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
833.0	So we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control . 	ES2008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
657.09	Buy a fifty cents battery and uh 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
766.38	It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor . Okay . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
793.52	Do your thing . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
927.42	It'll float . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1104.39	When your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1113.53	Take it . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1190.75	Um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1196.88	Maybe even li like this with uh u uses of a lot of space . And uh make the menu structure changeable . So if you press um system , that's Yeah , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or or one , can fit in . Or maybe even a step further when you want to um 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[li]
1248.27	inside your hands . And some remotes you can use with your thumb . But I think that's too difficult for this one . So you can make it s a little broader . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1262.65	on the on the main buttons . And use your other hands 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1289.48	So you can use it in uh in this way . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1297.88	One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . Um , know that if you are changing the menu structure here , um 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1511.56	You c may use like when there's uh X_P_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three . And if you push parents , then Yeah . To log in . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_P]
1587.61	Well , maybe um some idea on that . Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do . Just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles or something . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1695.15	Yeah , the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all , will have to decide uh 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1729.81	Well , yeah you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then , but 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[fourteen, to, sixteen]	[]	[]
1845.48	W you can put it on chip anyway , so uh 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1873.44	Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . So we should make it too complex . Is t some menu uh function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . But uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1903.81	Ye I I think best would be uh to put it in and make it an menu option . You can put on Yeah . And you can just uh s when you buy it , you can select um personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2011.64	You have to f Yeah . Uh , or make it ourselves very diffic 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2273.42	Well , you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they'll still remember it . And it it l linger on every time you see it . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2358.73	Stay here and 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2388.12	Uh-huh . See you . 	TS3007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
287.73	Just press the arrow keys I think . Usually goes to it . 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
633.32	Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well . Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say . 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Corinne]
642.24	'Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design . 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
708.39	but you have to i they're a nightmare to use . You have to set them , reset them to everything . Um and that would only add buttons . Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . Um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . Um 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
737.57	Okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls . They're just simple T_V_ remote controls . But one is uh user-centred . That is the one on the left . And you can straight away see there's less buttons . And the other one is engineer-centred where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
803.44	Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . Um and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . And then and change the fashion of remote controls . 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1299.0	Yeah . It'll wear off . 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1457.0	I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . Is that if it came with maybe a holder 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1466.17	or holster , whatever you wanna call it . Um that you you should put it back in . Your remote . But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something . Just by infrared . That shouldn't be too complex I would've thought . 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1486.33	Yeah it would be quite good . The ball could sit on a 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1647.77	I'll yeah I'll have a look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break . 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1656.08	I th I I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . The ball is probably not a good idea . And even something that's held like that might be difficult . So that I think it still has to be a variation . 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2056.36	To the thumb yeah . Maybe the buttons could like uh 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2181.92	with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb . So you'd have your , you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there . 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2197.35	And then your thumb would do you'd have all the buttons sort of round here . And that I think could work . On any hand . If you just had it like wrapped round there . Left or right . 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2213.37	Minimise its size . It could be you know really quite small . 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2376.32	How well it'll work yeah . 	ES2016b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
27.5	It does look very cool . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
200.98	It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
266.08	Ah , you did get that in then , mm-hmm . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm]
307.38	On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
486.09	Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[A, B, _, C, _, A, _, B, _, C, _]
709.09	So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
828.79	Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[B]
958.0	That's it , they can take it with them . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1184.86	Yeah , you might end up having to take off the 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1275.8	Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1341.67	See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[pushbutton]
1420.15	Could b still put them on the side . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1598.05	If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1652.32	Uh I like the pens . I want one . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1738.39	I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1791.53	I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a remote control . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1914.64	We could draw animals on the board again . 	ES2006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
591.33	And it should fit the hand . 	IS1004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
905.45	Change the channels . Yeah . 	IS1004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1303.19	it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing . 	IS1004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert]
1401.64	Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc 	IS1004b.C.words.xml	True	[somewhere, ninety, seven]	[]	[]
1506.31	So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver . 	IS1004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[A_S_R]
1529.83	So this is the easiest design the there could be . So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in . 	IS1004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1535.96	To have different technologies . So this was the my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control . Yeah . 	IS1004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1940.01	Yep , yep . Okay , yeah . So so yeah . So so it's just a matter of adding these , the two mouse pointers and the um two gazes as extra objects . Um so yeah . As long as as long as they've got an I_D_ in there we can just say right at this p between these times they're looking at that object or they're looking at the mouse , they're looking at whatever . 	EN2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2485.37	Yeah . But you can still ta you can still track what parts went into it . So you can still find triangle one , whatever . 	EN2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[triangle]
2807.68	If you have five black triangles gonna be five five parts in the fi five black black triangles in the parts box . But what what what but what you can do well if in the in the initial configuration you can re-use a triangle . So if you so if you only want one black triangle , you just create one black triangle in the parts box and then re-use that pa that triangle five times in the configuration . 	EN2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[pa]
3095.8	Yeah , yeah . 'Cause uh there's a joint action . The result the t what you need for a join action you need to yeah , a construct and a part , two parts , whate whatever you're taking together . And then the result of that is a construct . You've got time when that happens . You can see that construct appeared at that time . Um and you can still track the children of that construct . 	EN2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3835.57	Yeah , you got exactly the same access to sound quality as you got from anythi anything else on the Windows . So you can you decide whatever quality you want . So got a bit of 	EN2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[anythi, Windows]
4095.14	Yes , it's a stereo jack . It's a stereo jack . But it's a mono but it's a mono uh microphone . Mono mono recording on microphones . Line in . Uh sp going going through a line in . So it's a so it's a lit so it's quieter because it's not as though it's not powered . But it's still , think , yeah . We we still pick up a signal . 	EN2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mono]
4186.89	Yeah . Als think we we have a well I suppo I suppose it well one th one thing you do is uh re is record the sou speech signal separately for each for each person . But then you'd have to pull the two pull the two sounds together . 	EN2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Als, sou, signal]
4221.11	Yeah , it's easy . Easy . If if nothing if nothing else you h uh if nothing else you can do it in a MATLAB script . You just write read read file one , read file two . And then you just yeah . 	EN2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[MATLAB]
4237.78	Yeah , but then the the the MATLAB the MATLAB script will tell you how l it will tell you how far apart they are . 'Cause you can do you can just measure the drift between the two of them . 'Cause you got a l you got a list of where the where the beeps are . And then you say right , this stream is like , I don't know , nought point two five seconds behind the other one . 	EN2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[MATLAB, MATLAB]
4447.67	Yeah . So and basically out the output the G_D_F_ is just gonna be a whole series of events , you know , with start and end time . And the event's gonna have whatever all whatever the object uh is that's being looked at and things . Um and then , yeah , and then it's a matter of we're gonna put whatever filters you need after that . So you can say right , I just want so you can say from the time where they picked up triangle one to the part time it became part of the assembly , find out how it's how m percentages of time they were looking at it or whatever . 	EN2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[G_D_F, _]
4486.07	Yep . So yeah . So you got mo yeah . There there's move events . There's look events . there's fixations and blinks now at the moment as well . Um and , yeah , and oh yeah and see uh looks at looks at objects and looks whatever else . So um s 	EN2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4836.78	Yep . Yeah . So we'll we'll get we'll get the get the audio stuff tested , you know , single microphones . Um yeah . Get that tested next couple days and I assu I assume that's not something you need me for t in terms of that . 	EN2009d.D.words.xml	True	[next, couple, days]	[]	[]
80.74	Ah of course , how to to design this uh this yeah . 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
90.85	um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert . 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert]
99.19	So wait a minute . Mm . 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
357.31	Okay uh tha that's look great . 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
704.34	Wait a second . Argh . 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Argh]
750.28	Okay . Let's go . 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1247.33	Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1491.36	To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh . 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1549.82	Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or mm . 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1607.84	Uh train it , okay . 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1792.77	Sho to to train , okay . 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1873.2	And we can increase this the strength y you can buy one with 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1920.89	Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1928.61	we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1953.78	you will focus on the component concept um 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2014.77	Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that . 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2056.25	Think 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2113.81	Mm-hmm , so let's to think s so that yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh . 	IS1006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
65.14	Let's hope the pen holds out . 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
577.73	Excellent . Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to you can sit down , but just we might need you to leap up . 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1012.28	Excellent . Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once . 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1029.49	The project documents . Excellent . If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it . 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1127.73	That's over on the interface , if if you could put 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1214.16	And then you can flip it open . 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1304.17	Yeah , and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well . 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1335.36	From from bouncing it . You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open . 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1453.65	Yeah , rub off some of those . 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1483.73	Depends how much how much movement it really needs . Pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it . I'd I'd keep it on . 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1533.12	Yeah , and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1886.54	Shall we go for if we're going for rubber , we think uh on as our case , and then 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2168.84	Y ah nobody wants to talk to you . Unplug yourself . 	ES2006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
447.99	you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . 	ES2016a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
627.66	And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting . 	ES2016a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
888.07	keyboard type shape , you know , like video games l so . But maybe I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . I don't know . 	ES2016a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
383.3	he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like um powerful , strong , uh I dunno . 	IS1004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
79.54	We can have a good look at that . 	ES2014d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
126.71	It it'd probably have to be labelled mute . But um , we didn't have anything small enough to write . 	ES2014d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
798.99	But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery . 	ES2014d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
937.04	Yeah , I'd maybe give it a 	ES2014d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1062.63	I would give it more than a four . 	ES2014d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1151.6	Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . And then it stand the test of time better . 	ES2014d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1272.52	Yeah , I would say so as well . 	ES2014d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1451.33	we'll probably have to re-rate it . 	ES2014d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1499.44	Yeah , I think that'd be fine . Because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway . 	ES2014d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1629.54	Yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit . 	ES2014d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2500.33	kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing . 	ES2014d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
580.8	Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example . 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
606.17	Uh yeah yeah , I'll go , sure . 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
624.23	Right uh , I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . Well uh what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls and um I viewed how how they w looked , how they worked , uh what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together . And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
709.29	So that's probably why most controls are still infrared . Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure , so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote . Well uh as I mentioned ready , we have some Bluetooth Well it may be possible , but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget , but that's not for me to decide , but that's maybe something for marketing to look into . F because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth or or radio waves , although 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bluetooth, F, Bluetooth]
766.25	Yeah . Yeah , I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function . So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem , but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something , I dunno , maybe uh maybe something to look into , I dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be . But it may be uh may be something to explore . Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components . Uh first you have the energy source . The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere . I figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one . 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1357.75	Yeah , but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something . 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1592.52	Yeah , yeah , like like the iPod idea that that we just saw . You just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make uh several you can also improve uh later on . 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
1821.54	Uh I do agree , because well , it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button , but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience . W we are aiming for younger people and they they chose 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2020.1	Well they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_ and that that is bit of a tricky job . I actually use one of those when They are they are kinda kinda troublesome , but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes , because uh in order for the remote to process something from the T_V_ , like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive , and that's well 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, T_V]
2148.72	Yeah , firmware upgrade . 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2177.19	Yeah , maybe something like service cen Or you could well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection . 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2203.08	Well then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in , we could actually look at into it , but I dunno , it it would be uh bringing more costs uh with with it and 	TS3007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
748.63	We we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . But uh 	IS1002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1092.6	D you must have very long shirts . That's way far down lapel mic . 	IS1002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1138.12	Use them like that . 	IS1002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
346.73	Drop it . 	TS3005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
940.95	Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . Findings I made . The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . 	TS3005c.D.words.xml	True	[the, past, years, last, year]	[]	[]
983.82	The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff . 	TS3005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1165.92	Look something like that . Autumn colours like red , brown . They liked the wood a lot . So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . And a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things . 	TS3005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1233.21	Or No . Or or wh what's something harder . No no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in , or something harder . 	TS3005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1253.6	Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in . It's feels kind s spongy . 	TS3005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[kind, s]
1396.49	Use a pen You you c you can lose the pen . 	TS3005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1417.68	Yeah but that that can be with plain soft tissue . Yeah , you can buy those at 	TS3005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1471.79	then you can re you can uh change them . 	TS3005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1689.12	You can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to put it get it in your hand , you can put it next to you and then dive it in and . Yeah . 	TS3005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1720.0	And load it on the the user the server . 	TS3005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
488.36	Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_S_I]
616.02	Okay . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . My own rating for that would be a two . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Criteria, A, _]
638.81	I'll just go this way . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
680.8	I would give that a three . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
714.96	So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end . It's a very slightly altered 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
745.99	Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
818.61	So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . Okay . And the spongy feel is no problem with that . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
844.67	That part was nice and easy . Okay . Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
945.46	That sounds good then . I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1033.08	on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1050.9	Good . Fine then . I'll just leave it there . Oops . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1194.81	But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . So it can rest . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1294.34	Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1515.68	We can put in our recommendations . If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . But we need to work to that specification to start with . And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1619.4	kick off meeting , . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1696.56	Although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . And I've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1806.77	Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . And fake R_C_s . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2043.11	Yeah . But forcing it onto people , yeah . It's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want . 	ES2004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
414.69	if uh that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but I don't know about uh I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
679.72	Sample sensor sample speaker . It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that . But uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase . So , I mean , you know , I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control . But basically the thing is , we have this technology available 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sample]
885.64	to use as a speech recognition engine , so 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
889.98	Um , yeah . So if we can just move on to the next slide , I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking uh remote control 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
921.43	But um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of , you know , I think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing , so . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
935.54	But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , because it's it's the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response , so . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
951.08	But um , I've also included this turbo button because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , and well so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
976.44	Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
993.94	Yeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them and you know , it's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1011.57	So yeah , that's um , those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote , but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1022.89	You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1055.96	I mean we could have well , I guess you need an on and off switch , but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1116.29	Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1127.16	Well that's its current application , I would presume that it's kind of , they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1152.13	But um I did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about um being able to find the remote control and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well . It might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1318.38	could be uh quite a stylish uh option , if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some , some varnish on . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1348.2	And I mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1421.98	like with a banana you can have 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1444.72	roll it back and forth like that , but with uh I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1600.79	It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device . Cause that , you know , that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1717.17	Although you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote . 	IS1004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_F]
934.17	And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . So we can keep that in mind . 	TS3009a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
970.39	Yeah . Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . 	TS3009a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
988.31	Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and 	TS3009a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1091.12	Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end . 	TS3009a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1186.88	Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them , and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs I dunno but 	TS3009a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1359.77	Well you can make profit with them , and it's a way to make them trendy . 	TS3009a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1450.6	get 	TS3009a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
945.08	Well let's see . I'm going to bore you with a 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
957.11	Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . I've more information on possible materials um as well . What we can and cannot do . 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
974.48	Um but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
988.95	The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1059.96	remote control itself . Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1084.5	Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1112.74	Um you can see the circuit board itself . That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . Um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[board]
1145.76	amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1206.16	we could use for the case material plastic , 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1210.43	rubber , as well . Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . So it's pretty squishy . That would that would serve that purpose . Um we could also use wood , or titanium . 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1249.63	But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . Now let's first go through the list with the materials . So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . Can also mix these . 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1287.5	Um we could use solar cells . 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1302.62	m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . So um obviously 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1338.65	But exactly . Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[kinetic, energy]
1401.03	I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . This however may exclude certain um materials . If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement . Hence we might not be able to put it in there . So um 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1451.28	I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really . So that's for the for the scroll wheel . Um it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so I'd say 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1603.78	and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an L_C_D_ screen , and um 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1616.95	then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . Or wood even . Um if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1629.03	Add an L_C_D_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine . Or make it just push-buttons . Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . Maybe not the nicest feel . Or not much originality really . 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1744.12	Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , but uh give it like the surface of 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1885.28	Sure . Hang on . There you go . 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1927.89	Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . We can still do that . 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1944.17	However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . So um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on . You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button 	ES2016c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
148.13	I think , you might have to disconnect Rose . 	ES2008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Rose]
888.39	Ah-ha , look at that , showing up already . 	ES2008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
971.16	So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done . So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points 	ES2008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1101.41	No , no , no , no , no . Okay , let's just get back to my schematic here . 	ES2008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1561.08	To produce it , yeah . 	ES2008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1615.08	Yeah , simplification . They could have a crap remote that came with their T_V_ that's just impossible to use , or maybe it broke , or maybe they're just missing it . 	ES2008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2063.16	You could we could maybe do that instead . So you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery . 	ES2008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2070.0	I dunno , that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place . 	ES2008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
137.82	which we have to fill in later on . Um , you see . Uh , and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro . So , that's uh that's a big l so let's uh wait it uh um we have we have must uh , we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh yeah , quite a lot of mathematics . And after that , uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard , with the with our laptops , with the all uh all this . And uh afterwards , uh we closing . Once again , forty minutes , so uh let's start . I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation . 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro, _, G, _]
416.82	Weemote . 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
431.56	Yeah , I can imagine that . 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
880.37	Yeah . Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark . So , if it's in the dark place , you still see it glowing . 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
899.98	I think Ah , you must see it as 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
903.05	uh , w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls , there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room , this one will stand out , I think . 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1103.04	We'll see . 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1152.57	Oh yeah . Yeah , it's sorry . Yeah , if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro , uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation , as we have uh experienced it . Otherwise , we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy . So 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro, ra]
1403.8	And then w yeah , and then we could have it , but uh it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look . 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1430.67	Fill in Just a 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1434.51	explanation . I can delete it for you if you want . 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1547.69	Who because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[thirteen, and, a, half]	[]	[]
1752.78	get better and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk yeah . 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1789.94	Yeah . Now you you must push a little while . 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2199.22	You can go uh 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2212.57	to use . And that's a pity , if you uh if you have uh thirty , forty minutes uh for this kind of things , and we are now with four people , but it well , imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone uh 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2396.37	You can see it . 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2491.48	Yeah , I understand you , I can talk a little bit Dutch . 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2511.49	You go there and you go there . So , okay . Well , maybe I can then do it one two three . 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2530.93	then the conceptual design . Uh , well all the things we have uh discussed , uh the energy , which uh turn out to be uh batteries , so that's 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2596.11	Yeah , but it still has some yeah . Okay , but so we can discuss that uh 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2602.72	we can discuss that kind of things I think with the 	TS3007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
74.04	we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
97.15	So start , uh 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
124.38	Turn . 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
941.46	Let's go . 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
950.38	So let's cut the T_F_T_ . 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_F_T, _]
1011.58	So maybe you can finish your presentation , and afterwards we will discuss about all this . 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1128.18	At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . I dunno . 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1346.68	So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1494.58	Yeah . Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1632.77	Yeah , but do you see that as a 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1635.39	rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1921.94	So , that great . We have decided everything . And think we are on a good way . 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1933.41	uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes . 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1938.61	Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design . The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device . And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation . 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Manager, User, Interface, Mana, Manager, Marketing, Expert]
1976.68	uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype , and uh 	IS1005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Hamed, Peter]
75.97	well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
101.51	Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F, _]
291.83	Thank you very much Nathan . Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well . 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nathan, User, Interface, Developer]
325.04	Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F, _]
403.9	Oh yeah look at that . 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
491.76	Give it a little bit . 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
612.05	That's great . Thank you Sarah . Right . So um yep I'll just uh switch that back here . I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase . 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sarah]
634.82	Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations um we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , um so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is um we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um . 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y, Industrial, Designer, Sarah]
688.42	Yes . So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
722.28	How th this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see . Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ but we might be able to say um volume up . 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[P_M]
897.17	Absolutely . Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question . Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control . Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many , we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well , we don't have many um . 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm, Mm]
1021.44	Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control . 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nokia, model, X, _, t]
1089.17	Yeah I think that would be best . Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1097.64	built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea . With a touch screen for the basic functions . Um 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1114.13	And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . Um do we have 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1375.69	Well fair enough . Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Kind of if i 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1388.19	Oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode . Okay . Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um . 	ES2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
119.67	Come now , it's not full over there . 	IB4004.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
490.21	Uh remember Andrei , that was uh yeah yeah . 	IB4004.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Andrei]
1218.69	But also to read articles . 	IB4004.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1341.08	No , wait a minute , yeah . 	IB4004.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1392.9	But wait a minute , then Andrei has a two person office all for himself . 	IB4004.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Andrei]
1564.95	No , the rooms have to look like they're sort of occupied uh . Oterwise , we might uh lose room or two . 	IB4004.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2203.84	No , get the uh for the the bigger rooms you get double for every workplace you get two lines . 	IB4004.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2286.11	Yeah , they'll just give us a date when 	IB4004.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2335.32	Yeah , but right now in uh downstairs it's fine . Some people can pick it up on sixth floor . But pretty soon the whole building will be covered . 	IB4004.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
914.58	Um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched , um , to influence our remote control . 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1005.38	And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . And uh how important the uh users find them . So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . Um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1152.89	Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . Remote controls are often lost somewhere . So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . Um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . So it should be very user-friendly , you know . People know what to do very quickly . Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Poppy, R_S_I, _]
1186.15	designers can look into that . Um , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond . But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . That's a problem . 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1205.04	Um okay , here's some ideas for you . A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . So I'll show you some numbers here . 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1218.73	Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ol, s]
1234.36	Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . And if we have the budget for it . Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it . 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1356.96	Yeah . Or Like an alarm clock . You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock . 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1427.66	So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product Um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[fifteen, to, twenty, five, years, olds]	[]	[]
1467.34	Right . And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance . Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[sixteen, year, old, three, months]	[]	[]
1571.12	Yeah . Maybe we can do the 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1582.83	Oh , come back screen . 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2049.48	Yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it . Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . So 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2117.35	Exactly . It the it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark . It's kind of like Eighties neon-style . Um , whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable . So 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2194.61	diff , you know like five different face plates . I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . Um 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[diff]
2218.72	Mm-hmm . Exactly . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . 	ES2015b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
56.66	Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but I will do . Upsidaisy . Um Um we Yeah . 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[Upsidaisy]	[]
358.37	Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . Um unfortunately 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
407.62	that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
508.55	No maybe the shift button's stuck in . Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
685.62	Thank you very much . You're all get you're all getting a raise . Uh teamwork . I thought went well . Yeah . 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
694.38	Uh and well means , yeah . The technical stuff was brilliant . Let's buy more . Uh Right . Um I don't know what , new ideas found , means , to be honest . 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
742.45	That's it , um I think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you . Uh Let's see if I can get this bloody thing to work . Whoops . 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	True	[another, couple, of, days]	[]	[]
819.82	O okay , hold on . 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1192.21	Oh , I'll go for a one . 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1226.9	Come on that was the tha 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1572.87	Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a 	ES2005d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
191.2	Uh I I will focus on user interface design . Um so move to the next slide . As we know our 	IS1003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
229.22	Um , let's move to next slide . 	IS1003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
257.12	Um so move to next s slide . 	IS1003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
761.48	Design a wireless remote control . 	IS1003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1035.3	No you you can have a switch menu , so you can 	IS1003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1042.85	Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then 	IS1003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1053.2	for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . Then you you put the switch button , then it 	IS1003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1069.02	switch to another category of functions . 	IS1003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1073.09	For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder . 	IS1003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1151.08	Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , so user can select which colour they prefer , so . 	IS1003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
142.63	I did get a bit more done than the last time , 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
304.74	Sound . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
403.97	Alright . So I'm dealing with the components design . Um let's see . I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . That's why I had to , wanted to go first . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
547.84	Uh the case materials . Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . I would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
598.15	is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . Um 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
640.28	I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
674.7	Uh go ahead . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
936.51	Yeah . Yeah . Otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons . But we need more . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
994.37	Um let me see . Wait a sec . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sec]
1096.69	Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , you know , with the 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1112.56	There is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights . Maybe we should consider this function . To customise it and so I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people who want something , you know , different , or more uh design , they can go for one colour like uh for example this uh photo th camera . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1233.59	Yeah . As well . You can make a trigger button or something like that . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1239.18	Yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something , that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm . That would be a nice way to use it but I mean , yeah , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand I think . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1340.8	No uh like I would draw it like this . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1346.9	Let's say this is the side view . That you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . If you know what I mean . So that it would come up like that . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1362.45	Yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1405.63	True . True . But you can make a , yeah , you can make a trigger here . You know a simple uh with a 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1443.27	That actually will offer some extra protection for the 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1478.13	Uh yeah . Yeah of course . Yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this . Like like you drew here . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1487.17	And maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre . Give it I would give it a female shape but uh yeah . Anyway . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1497.83	Obviously . Make it more appealing to guys . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1530.94	You can place the screen here , which can come . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1541.14	I would do the arrows here , kind of thing . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1585.42	Yeah we could make 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1594.79	We should use 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1873.69	Do you get a pop-up if we 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1895.08	Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind . They will see one of each as grey . But if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1959.71	You can what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it . So that the whole button will shine 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1977.77	And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
2080.92	Yeah . Shall we uh make a new uh 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2269.28	Wait . Let me try it one more time . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2282.29	Okay , of course it will become way more ugly . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2295.21	This'll take forever . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2331.4	Let's fill i fill in the buttons later . So this is gonna be from the 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2382.78	you can adjust the angle to which it flips . So it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there . You can flip it up to there if you want . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2394.6	Think so . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2490.85	Yeah . I'm just thinking totally different designs also . Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . Maybe we should try something like that . But yeah . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gameboy]
2514.43	Yeah . I like it . Okay . This can go . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2526.17	Let's see . 	TS3006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
69.39	Keeps coming off . 'S fiddly . 	ES2007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
387.26	Cool . Uh well I'll try my best to draw . 	ES2007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
447.63	And they're healing as well . They heal . And they can feel when a human's got problems so 	ES2007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
774.13	Guess 	ES2007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1038.73	I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and ooh , the telephone's the television switched on or something . So maybe something that like 	ES2007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1055.92	does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . 	ES2007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1065.91	But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it . So make it Yeah . 	ES2007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
577.82	Yeah , to navigate . 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
613.53	Uh and and you can hold it , you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons . 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
627.57	Okay , yeah . Th Yeah . If we have enough place , uh then we can do that . 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
765.2	Mm most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages . 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
825.2	Okay , just leave it . Just leave it . 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
855.12	Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . I d d d I don't think if it's right . That shall show it . 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
922.94	The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
999.25	Ho how do we make uh 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ho]
1069.93	The fancy look-and-feel . That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . Okay . And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think . So 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1146.74	Okay , fine . So I I think it's very fancy . So I'll give it a 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1155.48	Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1167.52	Yeah , we shall test it But uh 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1504.53	And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep . 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1509.97	Call 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1541.68	I did save it . 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1583.2	Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three . 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1721.78	We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . So it's creativity . 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1827.13	Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . And uh 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1951.8	To gather , or to uh 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1956.76	work together , uh or new ideas for 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2049.72	I should take some pictures uh . 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2059.28	Let's play minesweeper . 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2298.22	Just pick one . 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2473.42	'Kay wait , I'm going to draw something and you must y 	TS3004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
55.15	Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
282.71	To integrate , you know yeah . 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
542.42	So we can we can say t 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
566.34	I will give I will 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
569.49	I'll gi 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
573.95	I'll give two or three . Three , it's okay . Three , three . Three is fine for me . 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
774.0	I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
804.36	To see uh yeah uh 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
868.03	To compensate . Yeah . 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
882.5	Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean . 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
895.06	Will you give 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1030.69	Four . Maybe four , it's okay . I'll put four . 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1038.46	You can you can erase with this er yeah . 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1400.98	I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have yeah . 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1418.18	Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . F some 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1735.72	We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1742.24	Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1749.49	Yeah , you can keep the global appearan 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1816.59	Yeah , right , go and sell it . Goo and good luck , so 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1887.54	Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1940.16	Yeah . Yeah I will try I'll try . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2008.69	Yeah that's that fine . So we can celebrate now . That's our new product . 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2025.09	Next time . Well , I'll buy one here . 	IS1003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
110.77	Um yeah . I just got a few slides , so show them . 	ES2015d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
214.2	Yeah because if you on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . 	ES2015d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
532.43	Mm go 	ES2015d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
663.52	Feel I think . We've been quite successful with the rubber coating and 	ES2015d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
916.78	I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours . 	ES2015d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
999.61	Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . 	ES2015d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1049.94	Yeah l lights on and , or flash as well . But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . 	ES2015d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1075.22	Well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . 	ES2015d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1182.55	Yeah , that's what I was thinking . We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . 	ES2015d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1663.29	So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it . 	ES2015d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1878.57	Oh yeah . Well mm , did it come into the into I dunno if we counted that in the costs . 	ES2015d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
104.77	No can that open . 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
110.66	Open it there . 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
379.68	Yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it . 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
433.61	Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . I think that's just basic what we need . And from that on we can user requirements what we need more . 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
488.58	M you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that . I don't know . Uh , I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh yeah , more trendier design , I think . I think . 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1208.68	keep it simple and look more at th 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1293.4	Will you look 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1297.39	Look at the market . 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1508.63	To find him . That's maybe yeah . 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1600.7	Mm-hmm . And use friendly , yeah . 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1918.44	Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down . 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1976.88	And you can leave it just there . 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2029.41	Can you make an uh uh 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2106.21	Oh , uh look uh look at the pictures . 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2218.04	You know look at the front , but 	TS3008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
284.96	Okay , so that's me again . Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v yeah , yeah . It wouldn't be very fancy . You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
347.93	Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but I don't know if it's worth the cost . So we've got to discuss that . 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
371.02	For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
487.03	And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
507.0	So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . So it's a constraint . 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
723.03	So let's not go for the 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
831.55	Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1503.52	Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bluetooth]
1531.2	I with the television , yeah . I was just trying to find an advantage . Wha what w what advantage would you get for the 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1582.79	Change the batteries ever again . 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1734.06	Well yeah , but Apple would sue you for that . 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Apple]
1980.41	And produce less of the silly colours , maybe . 	ES2007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
838.7	Uh I Yeah , just a simple experience . I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune . 	IS1005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
83.57	to make uh uh a new remote control for television . 	IS1007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
109.94	So people can can use it without any 	IS1007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
652.21	Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons . 	IS1007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
716.18	Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we 	IS1007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
776.28	Be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the . Yeah . 	IS1007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
911.03	And we'll discuss the other other aspects . 	IS1007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
20.75	Think we all 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
267.06	Think she's finishing up her presentation . 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
484.87	Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
714.39	Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
734.76	Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
793.65	Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um freeze frame . Uh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do , you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . And I judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
831.78	So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa , because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . So uh , yeah , that's me . 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Reissa]
1234.53	No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah . 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1341.01	Yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh . 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1354.04	I think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ergonomic, department]
1487.67	Sell trying to sell your things . 	ES2007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
201.92	Yeah we c could We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . Everything you can do with with the menu . So With the display . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
277.45	So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . And then just drop all the other buttons . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
316.99	Could drop the speech recognition . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
419.97	If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
427.51	With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . With the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[et]
583.56	Let's make the Let's make the case plastic . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
807.0	drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
878.53	Just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
912.19	Oh just oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . Okay . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
1181.68	Or give it a colour . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1746.46	Oh . Wait a second . Oh . It's it's gone wrong . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1767.47	Just count it to Yeah . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1944.5	Yeah we we can just uh use this one . And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh he only needs one button . Yeah . Or we have to delete this one or 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2270.22	Do they have a lo Oh , the here . This i this is the logo . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2541.86	Yeah , can we t can we get to that i 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2609.55	So cake . 	TS3006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
840.98	And you can have them at home . 	TS3008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
867.68	very good drawn , but you can see a cat from it . 	TS3008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
898.68	Uh it's i most cats are small . You can handle them . 	TS3008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1129.56	Uh , to go with to go with fashion and 	TS3008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
677.66	Do , do those calculators yeah . 	ES2015c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
776.55	Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or by the human user . 	ES2015c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
845.84	Do you think it's 	ES2015c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
859.68	So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . Like an L_C_D_ screen . 	ES2015c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
917.88	Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen . 	ES2015c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
929.71	I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic . But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points , as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe . 	ES2015c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
980.33	Um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . You know , make it more trendy and original . We'll have more money if we keep it simple . 	ES2015c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1047.87	And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use . 	ES2015c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1611.55	Just escape I think . 	ES2015c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1672.8	Hope so . 	ES2015c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1967.88	It w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else , just have an audio button though . 	ES2015c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1439.92	So what does that mean , Swedish um 	IB4005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1455.01	Just S_ , uh so just to know who they are , okay . 	IB4005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[S, _]
1660.82	Do you know if it's possible . Yeah . 	IB4005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1680.44	Mm-hmm . And so you can fit that , you think . 	IB4005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1751.75	You mean Maybe you should break the wall between the men's room and the women's room . Sorry . 	IB4005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1953.76	it's good in case I ever have to defend it . You know , it's good to have some numbers , if you can come up with some numbers uh 	IB4005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
105.24	So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Google]
128.66	Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Google]
146.9	Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[u]
189.59	Yeah . It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . Or to recognise it , yeah . 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
201.89	Yeah . So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart , so maybe we should uh use um uh 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
305.88	So you can use your gesture . That's no problem . 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
360.04	Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , so it's c come to channel three , I don't have to 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
466.26	mechanism . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French . 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[China, France]	[French]
506.87	Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
549.03	Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here . 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
611.73	I think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think yeah . You can see they can switch form one modality to another . 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
643.72	We should have confidence in technology . 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
717.27	Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
762.2	Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . That's the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
973.67	Yeah , maybe we can first come to 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
977.03	uh to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , then present it later . 	IS1003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[Frahan, Frahan]	[]
931.45	We'll put price up at the top . 	ES2013d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1019.31	yeah uh the uh is fancy . So let's let's take it to the next level . 	ES2013d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1109.32	Yeah . So we'll say we'll say uh false . 	ES2013d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1202.6	Yeah , we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro . 	ES2013d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[enviro]	[]
1314.28	Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . If not I'll average those . 	ES2013d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1799.65	I can give you a number , um it's uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two . I would say that's ex excellent 	ES2013d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1840.9	To maintain old technology , exactly . 	ES2013d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1874.28	So we might have to wait . 	ES2013d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
135.16	alt delete . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
268.93	The findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . Users think they're ugly . Um they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . So they they d they don't match what they want to have on it . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
326.82	Yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control . I mean if you can't control the the sound settings I mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something , you you need to change that . So um yeah we have to . We c we c 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
451.18	Yeah well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
670.95	Yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen . And the and the yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that , and then the basic function just on the device itself . So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , uh with a clear menu . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
769.85	So we we can go for 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
784.38	So we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1077.62	Uh you can make a if you make a drawing . Uh 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1095.58	And draw it very big . Oh . Yeah . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1121.62	Yeah so it should fit right in into your hand . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1139.4	Um then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top I guess . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1163.8	Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . Okay for example if you put the screen here , it's more about the functions now than the than the layout . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1277.94	You just adjust it with these two buttons . Then okay to confirm , and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level . And then finally say okay , exit . Or or one button to exit it . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1356.44	Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . Also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . So you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button . I mean if you grab it . But most most of the times if a if if a T_V_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on . So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1426.4	I mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down . Screen is over there . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1475.8	Yeah just oh y you have digital uh better write it down over there yeah . So you have sound . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1582.28	Yeah . I will look it up . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1660.14	Uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1708.55	Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible . I mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever . Just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1741.98	S uh let's say for example you have uh R_T_L_ five on on channel five . And Veronica on channel eight and you want to move Veronica to channel five , um most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, Veronica, Veronica]
1960.68	Yeah . Well I guess this this button , the the the okay , menu okay . Or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons . Uh like uh for your mobile phone . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1973.98	Um so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it . And then one to confirm , and one to go one step back . So it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone , if you have a Nokia or like that . Or the or the no button . To go one step back you it's only two extra buttons , but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nokia]
2023.17	Into your screen . Okay . So you l should leave the menu button out of here . And and just put it under the screen , the screen 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2070.07	Yeah . Yeah , or confirm and back . Whatever . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2087.26	Yeah . That that just to to activate the screen . So 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2095.48	And then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
2127.85	Alright . Yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2166.05	Yeah . And maybe we should use this also as an okay button , still . And then just only a back button . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2264.75	Yeah we'll kick your ass later . No . Uh . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2270.22	Aye 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2280.97	Okay . We'll see . Just put back my laptop . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2285.48	Alright . Yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that . 	TS3006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
175.75	Yeah . Okay . So uh you can have my project in 	IS1001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
196.98	Okay . So you can go . We can go through . 	IS1001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
202.82	So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . So you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points . We 	IS1001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
351.41	Yeah . Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm . 	IS1001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
569.44	But wha why why don't they have any representative here . I mean 	IB4003.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
610.7	No , but you know that that's a standard thing . It's Suppose that somebody for some strange reasons want to be in the corner and we don't know about that , we'll put them put her or him somewhere else , then we will do plenty of work for nothing , because we'll not have this constraint . We'll not be aware of this constraint . 	IB4003.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1066.12	Yeah , they will promote that . 	IB4003.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1169.25	And this will happen . I mean you can't you can't prevent having visitors . And you shouldn't . 	IB4003.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1581.56	So I would be I would be more of the opinion to to see whether it's it's so evident that , let's say the at least the two full full-time professors that are here on the list , we have one here , but uh Maggie is is not present . If they really 	IB4003.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Maggie]
1713.8	Again uh uh um , Andre , I think that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for our for ourselves . I can tell you according to what I know now where I would like or would be ready to be , but I really don't see how I could decide for uh Maggie or Pierrette or whoever else on the list , that they should be there . 	IB4003.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Andre, Maggie, Pierrette]
1756.39	Yeah , I would I would ask for their place . I mean that's that's that's the important thing you want to know . 	IB4003.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1772.31	But that that's an open question whether it's a it's a it's a it At the origin it was supposed to be a f pure reading room for relaxing , uh reading the newspapers , et cetera , et cetera . Uh there has been a very long discussion about that . I stinct uh this discussion is still vivid , that some of the people , I bel belong to these people , would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for sure , but also meeting room if necessary . Or , as uh Susan said , a room an emergency room where you can put uh some visitors in a decent environment for for for for work , because you don't have any other place to do it . But that's that's really an open discussion and that d I think no decision , no final decision has been taken about that . 	IB4003.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[et, et, Susan]
1917.19	And you can bring your coffee in the reading room . 	IB4003.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1930.96	Wait , wai wai wai wait . Next Tuesday . 	IB4003.D.words.xml	True	[Next, Tuesday]	[]	[wai, wai, wai]
1958.04	That yeah . That that would be great , because that would allow us not to move , or not to travel twice . 	IB4003.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
283.15	Glow-in-the-dark . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
495.8	Escape , okay . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
571.48	Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
574.63	Um this one I thought was really cool . It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . You can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . And that's really easy to use , bright , so I like this one lot for our design . I think something like that would be good . Of course yellow . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
635.11	Yeah exactly . Yeah . And um this one is just pointing out . I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . So that could that's a bit confusing . Um but the buttons on this I think are it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . They don't have to be all the same . So that's quite cool . Um . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
678.04	So there are some of the findings . So we need to combine those ones um and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . Um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . Um so I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . It's you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that's And it's much Yeah . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
714.69	So that's quite cool . Uh personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
914.67	So okay , I'll take this out now then . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1182.84	You do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1193.76	Yeah , that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1232.29	We could make novelty remote controls . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1323.17	'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1476.82	So let's not use the whiteboard any more . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1565.62	I quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1620.37	You said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that , like have a choice . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1793.68	Yeah . Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2243.14	No . Oh yeah , we can do buttons . 	ES2005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1007.24	Uh , okay findings , that's the point that I'm working on currently but uh so far I I was uh looking what what are the blue circuit , I mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , but the prices I read are high . So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe . 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[blue, R_W]
1104.84	But it depends whether we take a decision to use it . Same thing . It's fairly expensive to use these circuits . So , speech recognition well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know . 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, L_C_D, L_C_D, _]
1194.56	Oh , this is nothing . This is just my notes on what to use . And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . That's my opinion . Uh I mean if infra-red uh circuit not not the radio frequency . 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_W, _, I_R_s]
1472.69	Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . Uh radio frequency depends . And , well the recognition it depends on you guys . You should probably speak . 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1601.97	So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1606.57	Okay , so I'll make a note on L_C_D_ . 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
1692.73	Well , this would avoid L_C_D_ , then . 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1788.88	Hide them , okay . 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1858.92	Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1878.23	turn off the T_V_ . If if you like this , 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1921.94	Um , okay , just um the decision of the power button . Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1940.68	Okay , one nice big button . Old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers . 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2036.27	Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_ , well And based on your 	IS1005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
168.5	I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
259.56	I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable . 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_R, _]
307.52	One thing I do need to do we need to look at , is the costs . 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
339.68	Uh right . Okay , now I think we'll do this I could do you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power . 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
419.34	Okay . Right . So let's see if that comes within budget . And it does . That is gonna cost uh Yeah . That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . So , 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[ten, ten]	[]	[Euro]
444.47	this is all very very good . The bosses will be very pleased . Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . Uh . 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
461.77	Save it in save it in the uh my documents . 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
597.38	I would give it a seven . 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
650.25	Easy to use . I'd say it's I wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not . 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
657.17	I would give it a I would give it a two , 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
675.9	Give it a t give it a two . 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
737.86	I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
786.63	Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , you know , both individually and as a team . You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two . That's all , you know , gone very very well and and and be you know , has been good communication going on . 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Project, Manager]
901.33	No , I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in . Or six , uh 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1022.6	Yeah . Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that , it's that it's um , hang on , I wrote it down here somewhere 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1072.05	Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that . Yeah . So all in all , I think we've done very well . Well done everybody . 	ES2007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
15.12	Guess I should probably try to sit up straight . 	ES2009a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
645.86	Let's see . 	ES2009a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
736.72	Close t uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is , and 	ES2009a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Clare, Lune]
912.79	Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that . 	ES2009a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1178.43	something , uh we'll have to come up with a name , patent it . 	ES2009a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
494.91	And we can we can steal their ideas . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
603.98	Well we maybe we can think of that later . W just these are the ones you already summed up in the 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
651.25	That might get redundant also maybe . I don't know what kind of information it would 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
689.63	But you do mention the next and previous uh button . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
763.56	Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have yeah , they have to be large . Uh , I mean th th the the two two basic buttons , you know , the to skip channels and to uh 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1131.03	And uh , but I do like the yeah , I do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1175.16	Yeah , on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1199.1	See what was on the agenda . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1255.66	Yeah , but no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually . And it's also not I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something , it's 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1341.05	Yeah , yeah . You could make it , but it's just it it doesn't I don't think it it's coherent with the design we're after . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1349.76	But that's my opinion . Well , you you y Okay , we can vote for it . You want the L_C_D_ display . I don't want to and he doesn't , so it's up to him . If we wanna 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
1369.0	So I can also say 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1371.35	But did we skip the Yeah , you could do m but what what i so what i but do you think we should 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1419.07	Oh , well uh I've seen it done before . Do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d L_C_D_ displays , but then it's very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling . So it's that that's what I've seen . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[rem, L_C_D]
1642.19	Okay , we s skip the L_C_D_ display . I'm sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
1669.32	Yeah yeah yeah , p Exactly . This is what it w Yeah , but it it was already what we're uh we're after , you know , to give it uh , you know , the soft touch in your hands and also to , know , like Yeah , that is y the b airbag kind of thing . You can st throw it at your little brother's head . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y, st]
1846.18	It will it will break other stuff w when it's plastic , as well . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1881.76	Yeah , but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing . But the question is i then it's , you know , is is it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh , know , like uh 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2032.07	Okay . Yeah , but w yeah . Well , it is . It's a possibility . But , let's think about the bas 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[bas]
2131.64	I think this is okay , the so we have the basic . Then we have the numbers . We have the power button . We have we have a teletext button . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2170.79	No , you can use the 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2173.43	And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that . Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem uh yeah , mute . A teletext and a menu , and then then i that's it . It's all we need . Okay , uh another stuf some stuff about the the the design of the docking station . Something important about a s uh , no , uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself , I guess . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[al]
2201.82	Uh , in one colour . Just use 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2206.28	I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side . And we will make it spongy and and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s, fru]
2246.08	to get to that . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2248.31	Okay . Guess we're through then . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2264.75	But our des design experts will uh work that out . Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . So we will wrap up . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[des]
2284.08	Well , you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the pro probably . Yeah uh no , for su for sure because I'm will now type them out . 	TS3008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[su]
133.93	From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
149.3	And after that I have some new product requirements . So And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
176.93	Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
338.37	Save as . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
350.62	Save . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
387.35	Now have ten minutes to tell it . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
590.86	Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
603.93	Okay so it's the size of the remote control . Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you've you need the television , wh which can use it . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1409.12	So But we'll come back on that . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1417.06	Oh , go on . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1485.75	Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1529.45	Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1770.15	Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1787.64	have this 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1885.81	I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1915.14	Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1930.87	After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Project, Documents]
1946.31	Your individual action , you can find them in the email . 	TS3010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1432.28	Say another another example apart from uh this uh search . Uh I don't get it exactly . What you mean , then don't don't use a Google page because it's uh too uh s root , but uh another page mm . 	IN1005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Google, s]
2306.45	Did you manage to to divide the link uh properly or 	IN1005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
411.97	Well I think y bu y y you can actually mark it if it isn't altering what's in the manual . Uh um it's only altering earlier rules . 	EN2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y, y]
427.96	Yeah , then then do , I think . 	EN2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
709.64	Line in it . Um because I think that's s what you have been doing earlier on . 	EN2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1882.96	Blended ion lines , yeah . Yes , you do mean ion lines . Yeah . 	EN2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2422.81	Well hang on though , but um 	EN2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
438.75	Yeah . No , I tried that , but l yeah . It'll really speed it up . Yeah . Yeah . 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
612.12	Yeah . I think we should have the global top five that cause it each speaker's got top a top whatever , and so just say one of the boxes just explains does this is my top five dialogue acts for the speaker , and then in the meeting you have what you could either have the most commonly occurring ones or you could have a list of each speaker's top dialogue acts . 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
630.63	Either of those would do you . But it would start take a lot of space if you have it 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
635.42	Or you could have no , you don't need that . So you s 'cause it's 'cause it's a speaker window , the speaker characterisation window comes up . So you've got the global one there , and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting . And then then the top five in that meet in global , the top five this meeting , and then the rest is r obvious , isn't it . Yeah . 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
776.73	Um yeah , I just have to I'll just finish there might be some polishing . I can't remember . But I think it's pretty much complete done . So I'll do that tonight . Just put it up there . So you can us start using that whenever . 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
809.41	No , I just well it's called meeting and speaker . Well , I can judge it if you want . 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
818.63	We could put it in a sep in a p package . 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
842.89	Well then you can double-click on and it oh , oh . No . 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
853.42	Yeah , it will have something else . Just borrow a little Microsoft GIF like that . 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Microsoft, GIF]
968.62	It could even have some sound when it comes on . It go welcome to the meeting browser . No , that's problem . Have to do it in the 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1250.12	Send him an email . He'll probably re-do it anyway . So 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1327.51	So how many people do we uh try and 'cause it 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1335.28	No , it'll take forever , and then you gotta analyse the results . No no no no no , forget it . 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1451.31	Mm . oh we should have it we should try and have at it done by then anyway , I think . Otherwise it will start to getting b bit tight otherwise . 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1462.47	We should aim to be finished by Monday , this Monday coming . A week no yeah well , basically for Tuesday . Start the evaluation t pretty much straight-away and then get 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[Monday, this, Monday, Tuesday]	[]	[]
1473.64	Get s yeah , and then get um 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1994.96	Yeah , you have to start again . It's just do topics instead of seg yeah , you have to get the topics out instead of the segments . Uh yeah . 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2079.19	Well we'll certainly do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on the Yeah , but at at the very least . 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2132.03	the um from a plain text file back into organise it by who which speaker speaks what and how n doing the segment I think that was the stupidest way they could ever have organised the whole thing if you ask me . But Organise it by time not by speaker . But yeah . But 	EN2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
358.77	Yeah , it does tend to help . Yeah . Once you've been through the passage , you've worked out what they're talking about , you know . Yeah . 	EN2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
472.16	You know , when you get like um someone's talking and there's they sort of pause in the middle of a sentence that's long enough for it to put a break in , but they're actually sort of carrying on the sentence , do you have to capitalise each time you transcribe a bit if it's mid 	EN2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1085.99	Yeah , just change it to um . 	EN2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2128.2	Yeah , do it as Okay . 	EN2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2530.76	Have to remember that one now . 	EN2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3132.2	So do we just open the file as we open the files for the first pass , like open up the sound file and then it sh 	EN2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3184.79	Then you'll lose it , yeah . 	EN2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3298.49	Know what you're doing . 	EN2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
20.0	See 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
22.61	On your marks , get set , go . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
123.23	Yes , he's he's been e emailed it , yeah . Otherwise we can go onto our system and get it . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
133.92	Yes . Let's say something rude . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
232.48	Yes , if you see towards the top left of the image , you'll notice And luckily Olivia had warned me it might be complicated , and so I had something with without very many um n not little flying in and things , because that would just make it really difficult . But I practised the talk , yeah , standing up in front of it and pointing to things , and you're sitting down in front of And you could see yourself , but not only could s you see yourself , you see yourself bounce back two seconds later . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Olivia]	[]
273.27	And then we can start fighting about 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
276.65	Yes , let's . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
333.75	Yes , and I'm pretty sure I'm bottom anyway . So even on one we can tell . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
341.19	'Cause I would fight for line being a spectral feature as well . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
346.68	It's a bit hard to mark on this . Let's do that . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
359.3	Yes . And if neither , then we'll have to put something else . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
396.06	You can point to a soft component . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
429.75	a lack of absorption , you would put it in , because we said we would put describing words . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
442.35	you would get a pencil . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
516.0	Select a 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
602.31	Let's mark that then . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
642.83	Tell you who's more awake at this . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
717.48	You would point to it . Yeah . Yes , I think you're right . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
768.24	Line again . Line in ratios . But I remember we weren't gonna mark line ratios , but we were going to mark 'cau we're here where you've got equivalent width of H_ beta orbited . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[cau, _]
827.81	Damped Lyman alpha absorbers , I think that's a spectral feature even though it's 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Lyman]
881.77	So I think it should be the same as that . If it's defined by a spectral feature , we should mark it . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
896.69	You could point to damped Lyman alpha though . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Lyman]
971.48	You could say all of that is damped Lyman alpha . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Lyman]
1029.82	then we would mark quasar and we would mark damped Lyman alpha . If it was broad absorption line quasar , we'd mark it . Yeah . So it's just I guess whether damped Lyman alpha is a spectral feature 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[quasar, Lyman, Lyman]
1041.92	in itself . Which I would probably say it was , but then I've never looked at i one . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1104.56	Let's have that for now then . You if if we change our mind later when we go through , we can always come back to it and say 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1402.67	No one else can read that , sorry . Okay , so th Lyman alpha forest again . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Lyman]
1466.63	Line feature , need that . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1520.04	But if it's a damped Lyman alpha spectrum , you'd mark damped Lyman alpha , because in the spectrum . And and a da is equivalent of spectrum . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Lyman, Lyman]
1606.87	It's inconsistent with the damped Lyman alpha at more than the ninety nine percent . Or the damped Lyman alpha feature , if you put feature there rather than data , then you'd mark it . But I think data is equivalent if 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[more, than, the, ninety, nine, percent]	[]	[Lyman, Lyman]
1666.4	Okay . That's think enough . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1831.76	If it was lines from H_ two you'd mark it . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[H]
2029.08	Okay . Let's just cross everything out . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2059.73	As in we're putting weak and strong absorption would count , so I think blue-shifted should . Um 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2108.97	Um let's make a decision . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2127.39	Yes , that's true . I think you probably should then , 'cause we will put in our align strength . Uh if it's a F_ i of a two line strength we would definitely put it in . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F, _]
2213.25	Let's not mark it then . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2216.66	Well line , narrow line . If it says it F_E_ two line strength then we would mark it , 'cause you're talking about the line of it rather than the ev element . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F_E]
2259.24	Um take out line . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2389.49	And now align nebulae . Okay , we'll just go back and change those . You're right . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2410.07	Oh . Yeah , okay , modifiers with them , which is give a yell if you see one . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2453.59	Yes , I I'm sure I've followed that rule sometimes and just forgotten . So let's take that out . Um 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2515.22	Mm let's take that out . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
2909.77	Yep . Scribble away . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2949.34	Mm-hmm , yeah , it's a difficult one . But if we're gonna stick to it , let's stick to it . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2965.06	And I think we need the . I think we would put stop putting the in , we could get confused . And you're right there . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3058.6	the soft X_ rays or or the hard X_ rays , you can point to the red and the 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, _]
3085.15	But we're talking about the c the continuum though . If you have a galaxy spectrum though , you can say there's the blue component , there's the red component to the spectrum . Oh , I see what you mean , i like it comes from adding two different things together . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[continuum]
3098.5	I can see that , yeah . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3132.13	Let's 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3166.13	Let's keep it in . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3177.66	Let's start at the beginning . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3309.75	Inseparate . And it's just the and that annoys . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3345.96	Okay , because what we want here let's just mark what we want and mark that , but with also broad line 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3387.38	List the wrong wrong colour for a few things . Oh , it's all here . Hyper-luminous galaxy . 	EN2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
34.27	Here we go . Welcome everybody . Um , I'm Abigail Claflin . You can call me Abbie . 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Abigail, Claflin, Abbie]
46.43	'S see . PowerPoint , that's not it . There we go . So this is our kick off meeting . Um 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	['S, PowerPoint]
108.92	then close . Um so . So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . And to do this , we have to um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . So . We'll get to that . Oh there it is . Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . Um so we're gonna try out our white board . 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[white, board]
157.03	If we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
641.4	nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have . 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
716.23	just like a magnet on the back of it and you could I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . You know like a portable phone has a base , like just to have a home for it . 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
747.22	Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
805.9	Okay . So what do we think this remote control should 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
846.74	So you could like um like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can the way you do it on your radio is that you uh what do you call it s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
940.66	Um but it's something to think about , yeah . I mean we'll have to see how much that would be . 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
980.74	Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your like that's another 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
997.66	Um . We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1020.3	Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ , yeah um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . The 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer, I_D, _]
1102.5	Yeah . So I guess that wraps it up . I'll see you all in thirty minutes . 	ES2011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
275.43	Okay . Let's try this . Uh 	TS3010a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
533.85	So now yeah , now you can write another paper if you can 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
767.09	But the p everybody has features in temp , only most of the time all the C_T_S_ features or C_T_S_ wav files , so . So forget about C_T_S_ , at least now I think because it's again 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, C_T_S, C_T_S]
812.25	Yeah , the we can wait at least one or two weeks for this , because it's 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[two, weeks]	[]	[]
882.32	Yeah , that you can del 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
981.21	So bu what about this noise levels , like we have noise wav files in da da COM databases . So we have directly f wave files with uh particular noise . Ah ok see 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[COM]
1039.19	Yeah , so at least we have wave files , so now we can generate anything in the P_L_P_s or so at least 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1210.4	It will ri 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1248.37	Uh it will have measures like 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1488.23	Maybe at least they will give some number others , like they can . 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1515.59	Yeah , at least they they will know m beforehand I think uh . 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1741.84	At least now he can know a full system setup from 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1899.72	Hmm . So then again I will pass through full network . Then I can generate triphone gammas . 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[gammas]
2029.72	Yeah , if they can decode at least Hemant's P_ files then Hemant can 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Hemant, Hemant]
2194.24	Look for any features or anything are there . 	IN1002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
149.95	Meet 	IN1012.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
397.57	Yeah , that was the right choice , but to take something which which was uh direct , in quotes . It was n not the f direct as anything else , but 	IN1012.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
437.58	Let's go on , this was just a 	IN1012.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
612.35	Yeah , computationally e expensive , but 	IN1012.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1090.66	Okay , so once you have say one hour of speech , you start at the beginning , and first you try with twenty milliseconds . Then you shift to twenty five and so forth until you 	IN1012.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1459.92	So so it n uh it might be bad for then for the back end , it might screw up the the t speech rate or normaliser . 	IN1012.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1663.93	Well there should be after each conference there should be something like ten people should sit down , read the papers , and then rank them . You know , a all the all the all the similar papers within one session say sp uh focus to this topic , and say this is the best , this works slightly worse than this one , and throw away what is not that good and and th the first three three papers which are the best shou should be implemented and used from from that time onwards , like forget the all the M_F_C_C_s , because it's too old , and then start building the story on the new stuff and not 'cause it's 	IN1012.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M_F_C_C_s]
1840.05	Okay , so it could be you you would have to publish the results on this standard task , and then you could say well , I also tried on this and this 	IN1012.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2319.38	Okay , so we can hope that Nokia will be using tandem tandem P_L_P_s . 	IN1012.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nokia]
2422.35	It's like a it's like a NASA , you know , they use four , eight four , eight , six , machines to to to to put two n uh space ships , because it's it's known to work perfectly well or Pentium , not any P_ four or whatever , because it's safe , it has been working for twenty years , and then only it safe to put well not twenty but it's always yeah yeah , of course . 	IN1012.C.words.xml	True	[four, ,, eight, twenty, years]	[Pentium]	[NASA]
2531.42	Yeah , but it's that's a similar one to what Herve has , for example some he was showing it uh live on M_L_M_I_ c last M_L_M_I_ conference . You can look at the video and play it uh . 	IN1012.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Herve, _]
2829.93	Okay , I'm I'm fine with this , but I can make it run on my machine . Okay . 	IN1012.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2962.33	Mm well I can prepare s sorry . 	IN1012.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
571.74	It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons . 	ES2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
73.82	Yes , there is actually . Um I will li list the agenda for today . For this meeting . 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[li]
193.35	it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . The market , we should have a look at the market . Um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
289.97	Um and the last one is the working design . How exactly does it work in the technical sense . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . So we'll kop it keep it with the functional design . Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . Um as you see now I can give a presentation . Um it's also possible to use this one as well . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . Um 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
328.7	to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . Um then we have this electronic white-board system . Um 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
348.66	yeah , I will show that now . Um 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
352.53	you can draw on the board using this pen . There are little um uh sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . Um 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
385.86	you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . It's quite the same . Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . So do not m make a new file . Just use this one uh during the day . Um you can use the eraser to 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
420.28	make something go away . 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
432.04	Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings . It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard . Um you can choose the format , um sorry . Uh 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
444.18	Let me see . 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
461.96	Yep . Current colour , you can choose another colour . And um for example 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
470.77	black , and you c I can choose the line width . Um so now I d have a different 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
478.87	line width and uh colour . Okay . Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . Um to um oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us . Um as a little training um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected . 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ruud]
684.81	Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions well , just just let me know . Um okay , back to our project . Um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
715.97	which is quite a number . Um we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , um because uh , well , those are important numbers . Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation . 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro, w, w, Sebastian]
976.07	I'll go back to my own presentation . Um 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1429.76	maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or yeah . I dunno , it's uh that's more Sebastian's uh um 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sebastian]
1468.08	so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so 	TS3011a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
89.78	We should probably set those sizes 'cause that's such an easy thing to do . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
196.77	You can also control click on the dialogue acts and it will play that section of the file as well . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
264.87	Oh no , actually yeah , you can change it for in the summary when the summary gets called in program manager , you can do it . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
317.95	Yeah , try the summaries constructor . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
322.4	Well it reads them into separate arrays and then you can just change a flag to select one i which one it gives back . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
344.33	Yeah , I should make a new constructor that lets you set the flag . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
543.88	Okay , so I'll need to do some changes to program manager to be able to handle um changing results . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
568.12	Take and make them in a hash map or something . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
650.15	It'd probably be , yeah , best to make a copy of it . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
859.31	But we'll just create like hard segments at the start and end of each meeting . Like ones that are red instead of black or something like that . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
876.88	Mm-hmm . So other than , yeah , other than well we'll just create a hard boundary in between each one so you can see the thing . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
968.8	Yeah , it will still appear continuous on the display . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1170.81	Just 'cause that was lower priority . But yeah , all the you can get all the utterances . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1214.6	Yeah yeah . Like we'll basi Yeah . We'll get something to print out their locations . So we'll arrange it in a nice little order . We 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1245.26	Uh we should try running that thing again , see what it does now . Or just delete or back-up it . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1258.56	Oh j so I can print obscene messages in the background to um standard output . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1316.7	Uh no , we'd have to look in their code and see what it actually does . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1351.37	Uh it should do , but you've probably gone past the end of the file . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1392.22	Something that might be quite cool is if you could um you know , like some applications , when you open a file , you get like a little preview . If we could do something like that that displays like a five line summary when you you're about to open the file or something like that . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1415.68	The summariser is quite quick . It could probably do it dynamically . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1420.6	Yeah , it'd look pretty and I'm not convinced you'd get any kind of good quality summary out of it in only five lines . But 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1468.9	'Cause what would be quite cool is if on this search result , you could give it each one a tool tip that had the context . Like the utterance before , the utterance itself and the utterance after . So that when you hovered over it 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1494.76	But yeah , if we can get the tool tip , we should use it though . 'Cause I think it should be quite easy . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1887.07	See how far I get anyway . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1913.41	Mm yeah . Well you can easy add a command line parameter . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1930.93	It may even return a file directly . Possible . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1950.87	To set the par . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1983.51	Oh yeah , that did happen once before . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2180.43	Well you could you could choose whatever you wanted . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2372.31	We well we'd want to use F_ zero when it's present . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F, _]
2427.55	You could use um red green and blue to display up to three . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2499.66	Or you could just split it into two blocks , I suppose , for now . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2607.42	So just keep yeah , just enumerate up for the next number . Three . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2740.33	Well that's what I meant is it's a bit pointless having it as file open 'cause it will be opening those files all the time . It's more sensible to have it as an option and the location of them . Or just so you can configure the the location of all the files as an option . But when it starts up it should just read them from the default place . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2805.63	Oh like say if you could make a um change to your thing so it could display uh like it in two halves . So like the top half one , the bottom half the other . Or maybe three actually . Maybe top half one , bottom half the other and the third one an average that we can change the parameters for . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2830.83	And then yeah , I could easily make it throw out three different dialogue acts . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2839.48	No , I'd just have two of them not synched up because it's just for evaluating the data . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2885.27	No , hold on , you it wouldn't need three internal time scales , 'cause only one's synched to the clock or it c and the others are all absolute real time , aren't they . That's what's displayed on that , the bar , is real time , isn't it . So they would all be in the same time scale . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3006.38	Mine , I'll need to make a minor addition to the data manager and the summariser . But it's more or less ready to go with that . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3080.47	We could just make that rate be something completely different , just disconnect it from whatever it's doing , and then have that set the length of the summary or something like that . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3135.18	Yeah , I mean just disconnect it from whatever it sends the media player and connect it up to our summarisers . That makes different length summaries . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3144.13	'Cause like we could make that not even have like a a real sort of meaning , just put like max and min . And the user can just like set it in-between wherever they want the uh without actually telling them what it actually means if you see what I mean . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3176.81	We should certainly take away the labels that say minus four times as well . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3268.68	Or to be honest , like it's much quicker for me to get stuff done on my own . It'd make more sense for us to divide up spend a couple of hours dividing up tasks and then do them separately . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3301.96	Okay . So meet say five till seven , that should be enough time . 	EN2001d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
85.33	Okay . Um welcome to our second meeting . This is the functional design meeting . And I hope you all had a good individual working time . Okay , let's get started . Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . After the opening um I am going to 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
103.99	fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . And then we're gonna close up the meeting . And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
123.43	Okay . First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
151.7	And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
162.57	'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
203.16	Save it in the project documents . Okay . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
392.53	Now , that we've discussed Okay . Do you want me to run it or you wanna Okay . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
469.05	Okay , what do you m Oh , I'm sorry . What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
677.27	Mm . Oh , yeah , that's true . We could definitely include that if we wanted to . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
933.96	Okay . Okay , let's talk about all of our 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
938.74	We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's um wrap up this one , and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . Wait , come back . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
957.47	Alright . Sorry , let's go through this . Alright . Here we go . New product requirements . First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . We're trying not to over-complicate things . So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo . It's not gonna be multi-functional . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[TiVo]
1053.74	What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So . Alright . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1189.93	Okay . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1307.61	Okay . I I think we can make a decision about that later . Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . So that would include battery source 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1350.93	You could um we could hook it up . Oh . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1397.39	Yeah . and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1408.98	then it could beep . I dunno . Just throwing it out there . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1449.61	Unless you could say the channel . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1454.12	Yeah , that's true . And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . So I couldn't whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[this, day]	[]	[T_V]
1471.92	Mm . get your own remote , or digital cable . 'Kay . Um . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm, Kay]
1511.6	We could just have the logo in yellow , or maybe a yellow light for the keys . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1543.01	or no menu buttons . So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1562.72	Um can we go back to I'm gonna look really quickly back at those 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1689.07	Okay . get out of here . Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next . Mm . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
1705.13	Alright . After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail . And then we're gonna have lunch break . And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time . Um I'm gonna put the minutes I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , if you'd like to review them . And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well . Um here's what we're each going to do . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching . 	ES2010b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[U_I_D]	[I_D, _]
146.87	The show must go on . 	IN1014.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
236.88	You can say then you 	IN1014.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
654.42	Well as far as I as far as I know , I mean they do of course they can do of course slide detection . Change slide change detections which uh of course what I understood is also they try to recover the layout somehow . I mean given the slides but they are in no case they are extracting the text from the slides . So with in uh in uh all the cases what I've seen , in all the cases I've seen I mean they s assume that at least you have like a P_D_F_ version of the document or what . And basically they try to match what is displayed 	IN1014.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
756.51	But but most you would say most most of the points for us I mean would be valid . I mean slide transition we would use slide uh need to do it slide transition . To some extent we would like to extract some elements of the layout to disting to have a more high analysis . But we would like to do this more automatically and in particular for the text recognition to do to be able to do retrieval uh of slides or points . I mean of parts of presentation . We would like not to have to rely , yeah , to a first P_D_F_ version or any version of the document . So yeah . 	IN1014.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
899.57	Okay . To capture the slide . Yeah . Okay . 	IN1014.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
922.64	So we can tape snapshots . So basically it might be interesting to have still um uh the s uh the slide stream so that for instance if we detect there is a new video that is displayed also on , to some extent we could just cut this videos to keep it and to be able to replay it uh later on and so on . And maybe indeed if for instance the slide stream on the on the right is automatically synchronized with the other parts of the video , it may be easier to s to uh synchronize directly by some some matching process . The slides , the high quality measures we have here , we've directly yeah , yeah . Yeah . 	IN1014.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2704.66	And the the I know I'm we we see quite well why is working on this , right . But in two years , you know , if we want to do if we want to build a C_T_I_ or transfer technology and something like this , you know , maybe you c of course , okay , people will say yeah , but there is already something that people have started to put on the market and so on . So it maybe not the it's it's too late uh to to do it . So I think this is really so this is one of the points , respect to research of course , it's I think it's going to appear more more and more , and uh 	IN1014.A.words.xml	True	[two, years]	[]	[]
2911.22	At least uh say this to us and we'll see uh with Franck . And again , I mean this is a question . So now you are saying you have no time . So now you say to us . So now we understand and we are maybe after , when we if we discuss with Franck uh Franck Crittin or uh uh Frank uh Formaz and we'll see okay and go and try to see . Okay apparently uh he has no time to to work on this . So we think it's important and we'd like to to do something . So what kind of solution , as Alexandre mentions , i do we need to take somebody , do we want to do we need to take some intern to work on this , uh and so on and so on . Do we take to have uh somebody uh for contract , even if it's not an intern but take somebody for six months to work on this . 	IN1014.A.words.xml	True	[six, months]	[]	[Franck, Franck, Franck, Crittin, Frank, Formaz, Alexandre]
3396.21	you know , what are the problems in terms of alignments . Uh do do because it's not like with microphone arrays where you would need micro-second alignments , of course . Uh or even maybe with we want video where it may be one or two frames , I don't know . So this is really some somehow I mean the uh the the issue , I mean I'm sure that there are plenty of possibilities to do things . And the goal would be that indeed we could start uh rec doing some of the recordings of the time so that indeed we would already we uh we would have uh something where uh we could uh start getting the data . Because after , I mean even if it there , we cannot put all the times in one week , right . I mean so and uh so I mean this is uh this is one of the issue as well , which is to have it so that we can play and we can make a nice demo and so on with the full uh thing and something . So f the other part is to have a system which from which we can already record data and with some approximation . 	IN1014.A.words.xml	True	[one, week]	[]	[]
141.08	Yeah , at least on paper . Yeah . Yeah , at least you can write on the p 	IN1013.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
353.56	Because use linear phase or 	IN1013.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
684.74	You can do the L_P_ analysis on each sub-band , yeah . Yeah , m yeah , ok 	IN1013.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_P]
1441.38	Yeah , maybe you can just see how many how many harmonics . He was using twenty , I think . Like yeah , maybe you can try to reduce . 	IN1013.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1654.54	So m maybe it may help you , but it yeah . Yeah . 	IN1013.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1879.97	Yeah , they again give the phase . Yeah , again give the phase . 	IN1013.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2330.31	No , I was t uh doing some uh like writing some code for testing and these things where I'm making some t standards for that . So so th th there are like li the thing , these standards , how it works is like they give all the pseudo code kind of thing and then they put severe test conditions . So you have to pass those test conditions . Like then j you can say okay , we implemented D_ seventy eight or D_ se 	IN1013.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[li, D]
2644.97	Well yeah , I read uh I reviewed one paper like yeah , the that's that's from no . Yeah , maybe you can look at dates from uh you know east of uh east uh yeah , East Anglia . Yeah . Uh this uh e east University of East Anglia , Ben Milner . 	IN1013.B.words.xml	True	[]	[East, Anglia]	[east, east, University, East, Anglia, Ben, Milner]
2666.0	Yeah . I yeah , it's yeah , I can forward you that . They're doing lot of tricks . They're like they're again training Gaussian mixtures for different frequencies and then but they can they're following the yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 	IN1013.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2704.54	Yeah . And then construct that . 	IN1013.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
571.27	Oh what I could do is um work um further with um what I've got now and then just when I have my um um yeah , the final formula ready , I could uh t apply to the new stuff . That would be okay . 	EN2001e.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2741.41	Because what I do is um having um values for each segment at the moment . So I could just extract the highest ones for each segment . I don't know if that's good or bad . It could be at least I could provide some value . 	EN2001e.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3324.76	At least their names , and if we have their names then we can get their email . 	EN2001e.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
276.76	I'll go . I drew a kitty . It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat , but I love cats . 	ES2010a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
470.11	So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals . 	ES2010a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
768.55	For the snail , yeah , mm-hmm , we have the snail shell . He goes right back into his shell . Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that you know that would , that would really work . So 	IS1009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
824.45	cutest remote control on the block . So I think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition . I think those are the two things to push . The look 	IS1009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1122.17	Okay , I'll take my file down so you can bring it up . 	IS1009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1284.56	And our colour I think is great . The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible . And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it . 	IS1009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1371.5	Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality . So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway . As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products . 	IS1009d.D.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
1598.03	It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product . Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . But um otherwise I think we're we're ready to go to go with this product . 	IS1009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[heaven]
1676.42	Well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . So that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . And um then maybe we can do something with the um 	IS1009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1704.25	the volume control . Maybe we can put that all on one button . 	IS1009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1709.18	Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . 	IS1009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1884.76	Okay . Watch I I have my cord behind you here . Okay . 	IS1009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1918.56	It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace . 	IS1009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4886.18	Um right now d uh I'm doing I'm trying to do the uh meeting action segmentation . J because uh after talking to Jane um just uh we have different ideas whether uh meeting action will be about the same size as topic segments . So um it would be good to um t right now I'm doing this , um looking at the data and trying to see if I can do the meeting action segmentation first and the scheme , and then do topic segmentation again to see if the boundary actually coincide with each other . Yeah , if if that that do , then maybe we can talk again whether um i it it make sense . Mm-hmm . 	EN2005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[J, Jane]
45.81	I'll make funny drawings . 	EN2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
253.47	Oh . We'll see . 	EN2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
266.15	Yeah . I'll uh look at it like when my usual working hours are like from twelve o'clock till three o'clock or something , so if you can work on it that and then like No , actually not . But I'm never online on the morning . So Yeah . Yep . 	EN2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
307.64	Yeah , do what you wanna do with it first , and then I'll will look at Yeah , uh yeah . And I'll send it out to you again tomorrow or whatever . Yeah . 	EN2002b.A.words.xml	True	[tomorrow]	[]	[]
331.01	Probably wanna think about if we wanna change our goals and stuff . I think it um one thing that we could probably skip uh totally is the removing things from the audio files . 	EN2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
666.23	Yeah . Yeah . We'll see . 	EN2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
675.81	Well , I was still like struggling with Java stuff . But yeah but I'll work on it . Um I think uh I was wondering about that is uh , I haven't looked at it so much , but if m any of you guys know how we could do the like from the uh extract words that you did , like also in uh in this extract t time stamps on stuff , so we can is it 	EN2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Java]
741.0	Yeah . So now I could just put it in some 	EN2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
757.76	Yeah . I'll take a look at that . 	EN2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1733.04	Yeah . Yeah . And correct back any he like things that I thought was wrong in English or whatever . It like no . That's not that or whatever . 	EN2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[English]
204.48	Do you want the mouse , or do you want me to 	IS1008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
744.66	S 'scuse me for one sec . 	IS1008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[S, sec]
1002.24	It's actual speech , so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech , and the the user's speech . Otherwise , you can say remote . But if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of a sudden , you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies , 	IS1008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
1266.12	Um well , I mean , maybe if I go through my presentation , you can sort of see what the user perspective is , and how it ties into the other two comments . 	IS1008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1356.89	Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work . 	IS1008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ed, Christine]
1364.52	Um and then what the remote control should look like , obviously , once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are . 	IS1008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1416.14	So , here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . 	IS1008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1454.54	And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons . 	IS1008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1462.02	So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , sorry , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple . 	IS1008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1600.15	Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include , 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table , but 	IS1008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
88.92	Okay , let's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
105.0	So shall I go to sorry . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
109.31	Okay , let's go to A_M_I_ . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
288.04	So that will be the safe , so p any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
305.91	Yeah , but uh uh my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then uh technical I don't think it's uh feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
447.2	So I'll come back to the 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
463.71	So evaluation criteria , I think uh that will be good , so then let's come to the finance uh , I have some uh calculations which I made uh as for uh the budget . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
476.39	So here you can uh look like uh the energy and uh dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
621.0	Yes . This we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
660.19	But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that uh I will look after . I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1009.91	Yes it's it's very quick , of course . It will uh come back in two weeks , okay , it will be ready in two weeks . For evaluation , okay . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[two, weeks, two, weeks]	[]	[]
1034.39	So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[a, minimum, two, weeks, four, weeks]	[]	[]
1054.21	So we'll do it in the other place , and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[more, than, four, weeks]	[]	[]
1064.03	Okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , then uh it's approve from uh the technical team and uh your team , okay , uh from the management , then we can launch in the market . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1109.0	Okay uh , let's take like this . Let's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay . So no more changes will be made , okay , in this the basic design . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1181.79	Yeah , but uh see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like uh you can eat uh you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli , okay , so i it's a depends on the individual taste , you know , so we have we have to balance somewhere . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1308.23	Yes , the that of course uh I will convince the management to do that , okay . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1396.42	Okay , so then uh let's come to the closing and uh are the costs within the budget and uh is the product evaluated , okay , so that will uh come soon . Okay for uh but our time being , so thanks for all your efforts and great work and uh great design and uh let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ed]
1419.51	over and the meantime let's celebrate . So let's meet up uh this evening to hang up for some party . 	IS1008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
78.01	So we are here to just make the point . Well make the point , yeah . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
85.22	Make the status about the shot detection . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
277.25	So here we see that we the shot at eighteenth and after twenty twos and after again . And uh if we go down , I mean maybe in terms of shot here , we can see that 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
428.03	So it's yeah . The histogram , so we have experience with it . So it's it's scrambled , so you can scramble the image and you get the same histogram . So there is no structure indeed , so of course when you look the horse and then you can see as a cow the cows , of course you have a black in the top and uh you have also uh maybe eighty percent of like green uh , which is even not green there but uh uh grass . You have stones and uh so there of course are differences , because on the one hand you have horse , but it's black , so you have more sky , which is black on the right , so you don't care about this . So it's a glo it's global it's a global histogram , so yeah . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[green]
505.64	And uh so if you take uh these two with the with the Bhattacharya uh then of course you should just do a threshold . When there is motion you will see a lot of things changing , so by using an L_R_T_T_ threshold , if you see that there is a continuous change of the d distance , you don't do a threshold . It's only if you have an identified peak , which is m fifty percent or maybe uh two times higher than the the next second value in the window , then you say it's it's a shot . Right , I don't know . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bhattacharya, L_R_T_T]
599.79	It's continuous for dissolve , yeah . But an anyway it's difficult , I mean in th in in in general , because sometimes you have some dissolve you could imagine they are part of of of a scene and uh so , but of course when you have cuts you can see they are easy to detect , right , I mean like something yeah . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
621.81	So uh yeah , so with the motion basically the motion tried to estimate well the motion between two frames , right , if my image is there but after it's there , and it looks at how many points c are well matched . So you can see that like somebody speaking and so and so before the sh before the shot you can see that usually there are like ninety percent of the points at least , right , who have some motion , so uh 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sh]
647.4	But then after suddenly if you go from one frame and you try to match all the points here with like a translation , plus the zoom plus maybe some rotation , you c you can find anything well , right , so basically you would see that the number of points maybe only ten percent of the points you can match well , so it's easy to detect . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
664.35	And uh after you can see that indeed because it's a long shot and it's almost like a flat plane , you can do a very good registration through the number of points . Is very high , I mean the number of points that are matching . Uh and here you basically here with a histogram uh you can see it very flat , but of course you should go from this histogram to this which is essentially green . You have this big uh measure , which is here uh the chi two I don't know whether this is what you implement is used in the no it's 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
891.1	Yeah , that's true . Yeah , I can bring my laptop if necessary , yeah , yeah . I'll I'll bring it , okay , so it's it's done . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
938.02	Well no , I mean here I can see that it was it was detected as a single shot . Okay . I was because here you can see that the motion uh here is uh , you know , he is uh doing a zoom on the two kayaks here . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1006.66	Ah , to regenerate an A_V_I_ file , okay , yeah , yeah . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[A_V_I]
1189.92	Well sometimes it's very difficult , so focus , usually there is no problem , people say this is a cut , this is not a cut , but like for dissolve even sometimes , you know , people may it's people may have some trouble I mean this is a dissolve this is not this should this should be labelled as a transition or not . Some people will say yeah , but it's part of the thing , or uh for instance in like in um also in uh , come on , uh advertising usually . Because the shots are very short in advertising , usually it's uh very fast and so sometimes , yeah , when you have an incrustation like last time , what what should you say , it's it's , yeah , it's a change of 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1239.52	Yeah , I mean it's a so sometimes very difficult . A at least what I can see that currently like for CINETIS uh for instance if it's to do colour correction or for instance if it's too black , too a bit whiter , I think this type of things should be fine . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[CINETIS]
1301.27	Well , maybe after I mean they would sh okay , uh they would go directly and say select the shots from here to here , and they would say you apply this algorithm , yeah . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[algorithm]
1437.0	Yeah , but after I mean it may be more like a guy um i int i in an interface , a guy interface . I mean where I mean if second select from shot one to seven , uh this is a same seg they may do the grouping by themselves quite by looking at this it may take w w less one one minutes . And I think it's anyway , if it's too summarised after they may want to go inside uh to see whether there is not special things I mean , so . Uh because after it depends , I mean if you give only one key frame per shot , after I mean it's one hundred seventy images , it's quite fast , right , and so I think and the hierarchical thing is good , because still you can check if you have some ambiguities you are not sure , you could 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[shot, w]
1501.64	Well , ultim ultimately I think this is the type of things , but at this point we uh yeah . I I hope uh that uh if it's a big success uh they will ask IDIAP to to provide something like this of course with some money or at least to pay a student or somebody for doing it , but uh yeah , of course this was ultimately I think one way of uh if you could provide like chapters or something like this , indeed you could provide like the A_V_I_ to the clients , and he may ask for special services or uh and even to just to watch the movie , to have direct access to different parts and so on . But it's uh I mean uh this labelling might be more easy to do for the client by the client , because he knows what they're I mean he we wants to have this and this and uh right , so . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ultim, IDIAP, A_V_I, _]
1554.25	Yeah , yeah , he may want to organi yeah , yeah . Otherwise , I mean this but of but of course it might be easy to do a very simple software , which would allow the user to select just the shots and give names , and after it would generate automatically some index and uh as a I suppose the client might be interested in such a such a things if he could uh generate automatically on the D_V_D_ . But for and you could imagine that before sending in the D_V_D_ , you could allow him to l to watch this type of interface , and he would be able to do the selection , say this is this , this is this , this is this , this is this , and when he would receive the D_V_D_ , he would indeed uh get already the chapters that he decided to put there . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1790.61	Yeah , normally it could it could go faster . But i probably it's probable that even for the project you would do some of the reprogramming , I mean to especially if uh we need to interface new uh um yeah , or for just reading , I mean the the D_V_X_ and thing like this , so it's uh uh so tomor anyway for this we don't know exactly yet , because it's not sure what they want to what the user's tools for reading D_V_D_ and so on , so . And s because I don't think this is so difficult , now you have um already looked at the histograms and open C_V_ computing distances and so on . So if we want to do a special thing that probably runs fast , it may be easier to do it directly and uh yeah . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_V_X, _, C_V, _]
1979.24	You can do the get frame . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2364.31	The first time , yeah , but after it's it take okay . Okay , okay . I thought it was everything was generated on the fly th so 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2556.96	Uh . This is wish wishable uh functions . Okay , to do this . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2596.49	No , because I was thinking if it's there , I mean we could use it uh uh we could uh you see but uh yeah . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2615.35	No , no . Fro from outside we can view them . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3052.43	Ho how do you generate the Real Media , yeah . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ho, Media]
3236.9	Yeah , yeah . Yeah , but I think I think is it's too it's going very be very to be very good for them to visualise how you can organise things and maybe what they can do , how they and so this is important . 	IN1001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
138.1	Repeat it yeah . Alright . 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
166.29	Right . Uh well this is our design . Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mike]
194.58	And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . Um then we have uh the lower part 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
222.51	You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
330.02	Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want . 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
351.45	We thought about Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . And we thought about the logo big in the middle . Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back . Maybe that's too much but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
389.89	Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course , the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device . 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f, w]
409.67	Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , mean uh the the the the 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
511.19	And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , so Well 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
717.93	Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1259.59	And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people . Yeah . 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1275.25	Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then . 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1378.99	No yeah well Oh six . A lot of plastic , yeah . No two for the to make it clear . 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1406.55	We have we have to uh fill 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1620.33	W But also y you write things down . And i you can also bring your your your note block . So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1643.33	Uh I mean you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper If you've If you've 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1862.88	Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room . And then you can save it immediately . 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1914.11	No we must save this thing , yeah . In the shared map map . 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2032.01	Blame our accountants . 	TS3009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
578.48	L_C_D_ . L_S_D_ is something else , and it's quite nice as well . So , go on uh artist . 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
682.33	Let's change millenniums . 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
924.54	The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
955.46	Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . It's a kind of remote control . Uh it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere . It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . White . 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
1107.92	But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow , I dunno , that might be expensive but 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1206.68	to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired . 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1446.12	Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1458.13	more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1748.01	Maybe you could explore the two option . 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1830.62	You can paint it afterward . No problem . We have a very large department of paint . You will do it . 	IS1006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
511.74	I think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , but you can't just use 	IS1008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
646.96	Yeah , that's the one . So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , um , which basically shows , sort of I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control . 	IS1008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Christine]
750.93	You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , 	IS1008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
766.8	channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish 	IS1008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
786.82	And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . 	IS1008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
805.68	Um , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip 	IS1008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
895.14	So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines . 	IS1008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1073.66	Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and yeah . 	IS1008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1136.53	But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote . 	IS1008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
546.34	Well do we w like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
552.15	That was I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do , but let me I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
687.85	Okay , well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one . So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
704.54	rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that . So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
753.65	Okay , well give it a number , sorry . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
801.46	Okay . Well there's some other ones , I will address that , yeah . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
840.56	And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool . I'll give it a three . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1194.8	It's hot , I mean it's a mango , come on . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1222.56	And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1233.76	Just that it would se serve our audience . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1270.7	And so we're gonna do that , so it will address it , fine . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1415.52	Oh wait . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1814.96	I would break it . I would break it . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1867.67	Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , its all timed . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1906.58	Oh here you can you can view . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1910.04	You can just see what's up . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1913.38	Yeah it's it's really deep . Hold on . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1930.89	that kind of thing , see . You didn't miss out that much . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2019.79	Get crazy . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2030.88	like write up them here , 'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2291.06	You'll lose 'em in your pocket , like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , there's always ways to lose things . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2384.21	That really could get up and walk away . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2497.43	You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2505.46	'Cause I was like , it could go around the outside . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2552.71	I will I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , it's kind of an they were so not backed up , it would just be a sentence like we did a survey , this is what people said . 	ES2008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
141.51	I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do . Uh the trends . It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
251.46	We'll see . 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
290.43	The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . So we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something , that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong . And that's uh also for the younger public . 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
405.92	Yeah , we should change that 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
961.52	Alright . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1184.2	Yeah , fine . Move on . 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1413.43	Do you know the new uh 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1656.94	I think we can launch a couple of packages . You can buy a different kind of of of machine , but it's the same thing , but with another front . So 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1756.58	Yeah . But we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing . Else it w won't sell . So 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
1833.25	You can take the SMARTboard . 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1855.5	Have fun . 'Kay 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
1890.08	Um round . Yeah . Round 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1902.11	Curvy . Yeah . So you can see you have to up or down . 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Curvy]
1962.46	Let's start the design 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2030.17	Yeah , but you can scratch it off or something . It's better if you have it uh 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2182.61	Yeah , you can make it go 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2317.89	And it will sell . 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2388.37	Recalibrate it . 	TS3009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
142.58	Can you use double-click or 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
224.94	Do you see my 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
231.19	But well , we we can have both , but whatever . 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
471.86	Uh just let th 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
657.56	So maybe you can just like choose the s same window for transcription and summary . 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
858.82	Yeah . Yeah . Just so see the integration works sort of between the different compo 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
949.81	Say that again , O_ four . 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
994.49	I could tell you what I done in S_P_ two . 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
1699.2	Just looking at my own deadlines . See . Yeah , that would be fine . . 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1756.91	Nice thought . I'm impressed . Maybe you should make it exist then . 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1923.42	We can go look we can look at now , afterwards . Yeah . 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2042.24	Yeah , th we will probably have it , yeah yeah . last week . Yeah . 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	True	[last, week]	[]	[]
2069.59	um the same things as in the comments , if I could read it . 	EN2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
209.3	See this . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
260.62	Yeah . This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons . Yeah . So function , mm 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
268.94	So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _, L_C_D, _]
318.24	And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . You can just say , where is my remote control . Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby . And then , it will say hi . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bobby]
336.87	Yeah , hi , and then you can use it . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
342.26	So , um our team is now fruits . Mainly strawberry . So , you can have And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
363.04	We will send , we want to 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
375.65	So , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
416.24	Yeah . Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or s 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
424.8	And you can have many colours on weekends . Or 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
446.72	So , after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
456.13	So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
482.54	Yeah . Then we can discuss We can 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
488.39	Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
656.5	Yeah , yeah . We can give at least five or six , seven . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
721.12	Yeah , we can easily plug it . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
758.45	Yeah . Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option . So if you don't want 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
795.07	You can select . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
845.21	Um , see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
874.42	Yeah , because it is The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium . Yeah . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1319.21	Yeah . Then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes . And it will activate Um , plus , yeah , it's price is really 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1459.27	Yeah , just remo 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1515.0	So now on , we can increase our Still you have two more . Maybe we can use it for our party . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1534.42	No , but point five point three . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1586.3	And we can discuss all these things in our party . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1798.66	Uh , ye Will go to Italian restaurant , or 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ye]
1802.69	Ah , okay . We can decide . Yeah . 	IS1006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
151.98	We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this . 	IS1008a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
173.93	No , this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . We'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together . 	IS1008a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
348.32	At uh yeah . I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button yeah alright . This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
370.42	all in a single button . You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . Yeah . This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ . 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y, L_C_D, _, L_C_D]
464.5	Oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
475.28	W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
540.08	Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , so is uh modular . 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
562.36	Yeah yeah , for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . So 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
592.57	Uh yeah yeah you should present that . 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
701.15	Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_ 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[A_A, y]
769.94	So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . Yeah . And and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from yeah . And also like the and the fancy designs yeah . Maybe we can improve more on the design but uh this is the 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1150.17	I think we can improve on the design . Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design . Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help . Yeah . 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1272.52	It's the same innovation . So maybe I can put six to seven . 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[six, to, seven]	[]	[]
1354.55	we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , we give what the customer uh wants , right . 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1543.49	To improve on the design . 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1625.57	Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . You are Marketing Manag . 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Marketing, Manag]
1689.14	Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . 	IS1007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
16.76	Can you just remind me , I don't have to tick the no n okay thing until I finish writing , but it's only if I go back to it I tick okay again . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
42.5	So if I'm working o if I've done a page , I'm on the second page , I tick it so um I finish that page and I go back to this , I can just write and then not tick until I finish writing again . Yeah , so it's always after , n you never have to it before . Fine . Fine . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
69.32	And you can go on both sides as well . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
107.48	And I'll do that 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
130.31	Yeah , we're gonna do that , but I think we should s probably send out um separate calls , okay . So we'll send one , but weren't men I mean we could mention the fact that we're inviting other people , but I think it will probably just uh I mean it probably won't matter too much to the other linguists that we're having other people there . We can mention it , but it's not gonna be too essential and uh we might actually just end up making them worry that , you know , they're gonna lose their place or whatever , because uh I don't know . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
162.69	But we do we do have to decide a priority thing , so that's something else we can look at um a little bit 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
185.08	I'll do that today or tomorrow . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[today, tomorrow]	[]	[]
189.09	Um now Claire , that's the other thing , she can deal with the Psychology . Um 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Claire]
199.11	Psychology people , probably that's I reckon it's the best thing to do . 'Cause she'll know which email address to use and and everything else . So um 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
209.72	if one of us could email Claire . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Claire]
231.56	we might need to just remind her of the dates in case she doesn't know , so she gets the dates right . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
331.13	Yeah , exactly . They know her , et cetera . Um so yeah , so if if we've s if I've C_C_ed the original one , then you can tell her that that can be the basis for 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
535.24	Oh , so just have an hour and a half in the morning . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
584.67	Okay , let's just put this down . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
611.13	Well I could look 'cause I I've got that there's the list , isn't there , of post-graduates I maintain in in linguistics . Um there are probably about thirty on there . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
645.22	if we had say twenty linguistics and even then , I mean there are quite a few people who are abroad and who won't bother to turn up or can't make it or whatever . So , you know , it might be that we only get say fifteen anyway , and then we could be left with uh fifteen blocks for um the rest of P_P_L_S_ . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
802.02	And we could probably get quite a few in there , at least six anyway . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
899.65	Yeah , I think that's definitely the idea , I think the best idea . I can imagine it would seem a bit random just have like a poster session and bes uh yeah , just have a p a poster session um 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[bes]
959.24	we've got an idea . I think there's thirty talks and and say six , ten posters , whatever we can manage to fit in the room . Um so we need to look at we need to look at where we're gonna ho hold it . We could have it in B_ nine , but there's things all over the wall . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ho]
1022.66	Well what we'll do is sa we can just say uh if you want to do a talk , then just say so , and if you want to do a poster , then say you want to do a poster . And we can sort of base it around that . And if we get absolutely tons of people wanting to do posters and we don't think there's a you know , everyone's kind of done it as a cop-out , then we might have to sort of say to them well , you know , would you consider doing a talk instead , because uh particularly the second and third-years , because we need more talks , and just , you know , do it like that . Um we could even say something like um you know , first-years might want to give a poster or something like that because I don't know , maybe that's a bad idea , but 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[third, -, years, first, -, years]	[]	[]
1099.4	Yeah . Okay . So I've uh Okay , so English language um we'll put on the main call , and I'll just I I'll just kinda market it as an linguistics and English language or something like that , I think . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1121.55	Yes , and Informatics , we could think about it as well . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Informatics]
1324.18	we could just say outright anyone in their third year or anyone in their second or third year . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[their, third, year]	[]	[]
1333.74	Or we can just , you know , t uh take whatever we get and pick the best between us , which is 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1374.23	Yeah , so what you want to say is anyone who wants to give a talk on logic or philosophy of language , um but put a warning that if it's logic , then there's a good chance that no one will understand , or not that many . I mean maybe just maybe if you just put 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1437.51	for Philosophy students with an interest in language and and that's it . And then between us we'll have to have another meeting and and I mean at the same time as we're sorting through all the other titles and and deciding um how to divide up the sessions . See someone suggested to me that it's actually better to have talks on a similar topic spread out as much as possible , which to me just seemed absolutely crazy . And the reason she gave me was something to do with uh taking out like a whole day or a whole afternoon would be quite difficult , but I think that balance against the fact that most people want to be able to say well look , I can have just this one day off , as opposed to when I'll need an hour over three da you know , an hour each day for three days . It you can end up having to take three afternoons or three mornings or whatever off . So I think in general , and also for the sake of the lecturers 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[three, days]	[]	[Philosophy]
1490.98	Uh I think a lot of the time Simon Kirby has already said to me that anyone any of his students he wants to be on the first day , on the Wednesday , right , and that's because I shifted it I basically had it on Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday to begin with , and then eve it moved down twice to Wednesday , Thursday , Friday . So Wednesday is the only day left that he can make . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[the, first, day, Wednesday, Monday, ,, Tuesday, ,, Wednesday, Wednesday, ,, Thursday, ,, Friday, Wednesday]	[]	[Simon, Kirby]
1671.62	Might even have to come in in the evening . But that's not the end of the world , but we might have to set some things up . Like maybe just get the chairs organised or whatever . We might actually have to go into the rooms and get things ready . And there's gonna be other things like getting the technology ready . So not only is there a pressure to have uh 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1721.84	Well , hopefully most people will d either have something like PowerPoint or they'll just have uh P_D_F_ slides or something . Hopefully , no one will have anything too specialized . S sh z 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint, _]
1841.63	Um see ideal ideally I would've liked to have given them a bit longer . But I think w 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1899.7	So if we have it like a Monday , Monday the fourteenth'd probably be quite good for the final deadline . And then um if I send it out tomorrow , we'll say something like the el 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[Monday, ,, Monday, tomorrow]	[]	[fourteenth'd, el]
1916.55	Or maybe the fourth would be good . So give them a w yeah , a week for the title , and then they would have about ten days from then to actually get the abstract in . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[about, ten, days]	[]	[]
1946.56	That would be a week anyway . That would be a week anyway , but you can give them ten days to you can give them ten days to get the title , or you can give them it depends which way around you wanna do it . So what's gonna take them longer actually to decide what they're gonna do and send the title , or is it gonna be on the basis of the title , do they want more time to write the abstract . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[a, week, a, week, ten, days, ten, days]	[]	[]
1980.56	So Monday the seventh is the title . And this presumably will apply across the board . Like um 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[Monday]	[]	[]
2005.7	The only thing is acce is accessing the account . They can send it to P_G_C_ at ling as long as we can get the Wh I'll tell you what I'll do then , I'll go and see Mike th today and and get the password and everything . 'Cause 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mike]
2022.82	we possibly have it , but I'll just sort that out with him . Because if we're gonna tell everyone to email P_G_C_ , then we have to make pretty sure that we can actually access the account and that it's operational and stuff . 'Cause uh so far I've just been using my own uh email address . But it would be better it's quite easy to send f from an email address . 'Cause you can send from any email address you like . It's just the fact that you need to p uh it's just the fact that when they reply to it , you need to be able to uh access it . So I already tried it once , and I'm sure they gave us a password . And I even I even actu 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
2068.72	You may already know , but the thing is if you want to send this call for abstracts , you know , when you do the philosophy and and thingy one , then if you want to send from P_G_C_ , then uh I mean you might already know , but you can go f if if you did it from web-mail , you can just create a new account for yourself and where it sa it actually has a send from address , and you can just put P_G_C_ at ling dot and just do it that way . Uh or depending on your normal email client , you might be able to do it , but it doesn't matter too much . The the the other thing you could do is have is just fill in the reply to address as P_G_C_ , depending on what you wanna do . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[P_G_C]
2104.92	But that's what I'll do . I'll send it from P_G_C_ , so if anyone replies , it would just go to that account and any of us can access it at any time . Presumably , you can access from web-mail or , you know , or I_ MAP or whatever . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, MAP]
2122.43	Yeah , if you want to to create a web page and just copy my email into it or something , and anything else you might wanna do , and then later on we can put the uh the programme in . 	EN2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
572.01	Yeah , some beep or something like that , so that we can go 	IS1009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
581.48	Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . Yeah , yeah . 	IS1009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
796.52	Yeah , so let's see . 	IS1009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
281.74	I do know so . 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
326.23	No no no . So some television respond differently . Look , if uh i i 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
474.63	Uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , I guess . Yeah . 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
651.49	No , but if if like this , I'll I'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , I won't draw it really . If you got a base which is uh as big as this 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
675.42	Yeah . Uh , wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom oh , right , help . Uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh in in the 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
843.61	Alright . I will be needing that image , so leave it please . Um 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
853.47	Go away . 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
858.68	Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points . Um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . I wanna have a colour over here , come on . Right , the remote is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , but 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1051.48	Nay that that that's true , that's true . They're definitely needed . So 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1107.71	Well , uh forget that . Um 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1113.32	Go away . Remote control has got innovative technology implanted . 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1226.06	Come on . The remote control hasn't got uh . 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1235.73	Go away . 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1322.58	We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average . Four , five , seven , nine . Forget that . Fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[Fifteen, ,, seventeen]	[]	[]
1549.61	Alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess . 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1931.34	We can make a plain docking station for two Euros . I mean 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
1942.63	Yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it . I mean , 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2034.14	Reanimate it . 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2241.59	No . Well , we might want it , but 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2380.28	We can make a docking station for two thirty . 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[two, thirty]	[]	[]
2386.57	We can make a docking station . Sure . 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2451.31	You can sell for twenty seven and a half . 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[twenty, seven, and, a, half]	[]	[]
2719.18	Alright , I'll see you guys in a minute . 	TS3008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
69.97	from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given . 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
89.75	Um it's also an item that people lose a lot . So we should address that . And , of course , it should be something 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
184.93	you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch . Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes . 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
210.26	Francino who is our um interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it , of course , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
258.04	Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature . 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
314.19	Oh , come on , close already . 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
984.52	Go away . 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1533.62	And uh so what do we think on the concept 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1679.51	Put uh k I guess uh for yeah . 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[k]
1711.6	Okay . Uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the uh I_D_ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[I_D]
1738.47	and the marketing expert with the product evaluation . In this phase , the two of you , Jana and Francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches . 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Francine]	[Jana]
1759.54	Um if you have any questions , you know , you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach , I suppose . 	IS1009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
184.58	files , some X_M_L_ files and I was thinking if we maybe just should go through some of them and like try to see if you understand the general structure and pool together what we think about the structure , what we think that things mean . And then talk about how the annotation for information density and stuff should maybe be structured in a similar way . Or but I don't r I don't really have an idea like what , other words , what we would do today in this meeting . I mean 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[X_M_L]
332.69	Does anyone know any good standards software displays X_M_L_ , I'm not sure . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L, _]
354.23	I can probably just Emacs them . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
422.85	You know , wha wha each turn , so if we 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
501.11	Let's actually just see if maybe K_ right . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
521.42	So just see if I can view 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
578.13	Oh wait , somebody s s somebody explain that slowly to me . So 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
658.67	Just see , can we have this files somewhere . So the stuff that's 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
673.17	Let me see if I have that words X_M_L_ file . So let's for example look at 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L]
694.49	Okay , let me just try to get them all to a different screen . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
711.47	Sorry , I'm just I'm trying to arrange them , so that we have one above the other , so to make some sense of that . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1026.9	Saying that sort of we bring in information density . And then we would create the file of that type , which we probably couldn't call it segment . I'm not sure . We probably might have to have a different word for it . I'm not sure if it there's any trouble with it repeating . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1049.0	In the existing segments file . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1324.85	But every word does does the word picking , like does it always have the same information value in your thing i does it depend on its position like 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1681.67	Yeah , but I'm also just like I think that probably the entropy value at the moment for a word is closer to what we're at the moment looking for . I can just like k k I can sit together with you for twenty minutes and just show you the entropy code that I wrote for my other project and it probably and we should work together because it's we used t we have to we'd use the same matrix as I'm using in my latent semantic analysis , you'd use to calculate entropy scores . And then we'd have um a score which actually which would be the same for the word in each position . So in that sense it's doing something a bit different , and like w basically the score that I'm talking about is a conditional entropy score which just checks how much information , the fact that there's one word tells you about what would be the next word . But that's a relatively good measure of whether that's a very specific word , in which case they are usually words which tell you quite a lot or a very general word which usually doesn't tell you quite a lot . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[k, k]
1772.52	Least like expressive , and l contain less information . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1777.92	Yeah , function words or just very general nouns . Pr probably like what whatev for example the word computer in that context . You could imagine it to f like be in all in all the contexts . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pr]
1884.34	The same word the word yesterday would be would have the same score all over the place . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[yesterday]	[]	[]
1981.67	I like there is some hope that probably having just sentences where there's lots of very specific words , if you mark them as being more interesting than the words which are only very general words , that they would get us somewhere . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2039.3	What do you mean every sequence of the same 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2222.02	You know what , as a byproduct of my L_S_A_ I'll provide um a vocabulary like sort of a dictionary which for each word gives an entropy score entropy score , which just tells you of how much information the presence of a word tells you about which topic it is . Not which category , like I'm not I'm not lumping together separate topic segments into categories . But just like how much this word tells you about wh how likely that w the occurrence of that word makes it that it's a specific segment topic segment . Which is some measure already of how widespread this word is versus how specific f to a certain segment that is . And I'll just provide that , because that's just not much more work than just the usual thing . And then we can see how we can tie that in with the other stuff . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2391.03	Yeah , I think if we work together on an on an entropy based score . It's let me see if I can demonstrate 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2398.84	T I mean , let's just keep on talking meanwhile and I'll try to start that up . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2465.59	if we get it on a word by word basis whatever you do it'll probably appear in a word by word basis , and what you have on a sort of segment but not quite segment base . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2591.27	Tha that's that's a fiddling play in the end , but that problem we'll always have . Because we don't have a useful way of automatically evaluating um 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Tha]
2663.56	Yeah , but so you say that inst like you basically say w having an array where each each cell is is one like is o is one word . . And then you would map your information onto individual words . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2694.04	'Kay , and and then we could have like some type of just point in the end where the one scores from the all the individual word cells get multiplied all with like for each utterance or whatever . You have get all multiplied with the same value all the ones that are within that utterance . That's sort of the combination of of the two scores . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
2714.95	And then we'd have to go back again and then put that back into that segment mode here . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2761.92	Hmm . And their segments do overlap . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2783.45	Okay . So you could on their granularity you could on their granularity create a score like for each for each of their segments . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2796.46	Well I guess I mean for you , if you know for each word , if you find that out , then it has to be possible , because if we know sort of this is going from word to word or it this is going from time to time and then there has to be a way then for you say okay , this concerns these following words , and then just make make a simple mean over them . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2860.62	Yeah , we could probably like make a uh um graphic display initially , at least for our experimenting . We'd just place them in different ways and then see how they interact with each other . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2873.72	Okay . Yeah . So do you think y like both of you then can map something onto their segments , like just each of you provide one value , like double value or whatever , like one decimal value or whatever onto onto exactly their segments . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
2934.41	'Kay , I might just change my order of in which I do things and like forget my latent semantic analysis stuff until the weekend and try to really make sense of the 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
3017.84	And that we could load into a prototype and see what types of disp what ways of displaying this information are there . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3189.43	Um so what you would be feeding in would be just like one value per speaker per meeting , so that oka that that's that's your average baseline , okay okay . No yeah , that that makes m yeah , that makes a lot more sense , yeah . So that would show you how much relative to how he sort of how he's performing generally in that meeting relative to that how he's in a specific segment . He or she . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3222.55	Yeah , guess I've asked this question fifteen times now . Sorry . Uh 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3244.65	Oh they w they do exist . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3268.25	Yeah . See , as soon as as soon as I'm halfway through my L_S_A_ like basically as soon as I have the the matrix built , if of the document by word stuff , it's very easy to then calculate for each word a score , and I can just give you those scores and you can do with them whatever you want . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
3297.34	Yeah , I think Colin , Dave and me will actually work on on the Java stuff , and it and we'll just see whatever you whatever you supply us , we'll try to tie in and visualise in some way or another . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Colin, Dave, Java]
3309.52	Um I'll ask Jonathan if we can postpone the meeting to one o'clock . So that would give us a chance of meeting in for an hour before that to discuss the questions that we had . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Jonathan]
3397.75	Yes , but if it's if it's in a form which is easy to read in at the moment , that would be fine . Sort of like if basically if we have something like this segments file , but for each of you like just have one attribute . I think it's really easy if we don't merge them before-hand , but if we let them if we combine them in the prototype or don't at the moment , because then we can easily d display them individually , c contrast them to each other and play around with how y to combine them . 	EN2001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
130.26	Just go to explorer . 	IS1007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
145.48	Open uh . 	IS1007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
726.45	Oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . 	IS1007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
825.29	just give it a name and we call him . Yeah , that's right . Yeah , that's right . 	IS1007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
851.24	Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that 	IS1007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
913.58	Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . We just have the 	IS1007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
979.98	I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . 	IS1007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
994.69	So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features . And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . 	IS1007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1124.18	And the lighting adaptation and the teletext . And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . If you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes . And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German . So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . That should be a good uh point . 	IS1007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[French, German]
270.95	No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity if you will . Um . Right , um , of course that's uh interchangeable and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . 	ES2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
761.17	I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that . 	ES2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
877.81	And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . 	ES2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1077.1	W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again that we're 	ES2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1465.89	Oh yeah , still have 'em . 	ES2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1722.22	Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning . 	ES2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2032.4	Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years . 	ES2009d.C.words.xml	True	[like, eighteen, years]	[]	[]
703.62	Receive . 	IS1009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1239.88	Now for that , uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_ . There should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . 	IS1009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, T_V]
1283.88	So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time . So he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel . And uh the uh the uh and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . 	IS1009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1378.3	Yes , and as John Reece said the buttons can be , uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently . So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . 	IS1009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[John, Reece]
1456.32	And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use . Not , uh no uh like it can it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that . And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it . 	IS1009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1494.32	Timer . Yeah and then you can use a timer as well . 	IS1009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Timer]
1735.87	Okay . No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes . 	IS1009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
99.28	Go ahead . 	ES2009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
289.86	Choose it . 	ES2009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
389.91	It's an option , uh but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand , it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway . 	ES2009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
423.24	Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . 	ES2009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1046.95	See if we can cut some corners . 	ES2009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1051.2	Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . 	ES2009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1211.76	fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . 	ES2009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1628.6	Take precedence , yeah . 	ES2009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1645.3	Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p 	ES2009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
1852.95	Yeah , get in there . 	ES2009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1683.32	Yeah . You always could have a look at the time stamps and then take the ones that uh belong together to form an utterance . 	EN2001a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2627.85	Yeah , I w I w I would need the raw text pretty soon because I have to find out um how I have to put the segments into bins . And then yeah . 	EN2001a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2739.89	Think they say um quite a lot of numbers and before that , uh um there's this number . Was it 	EN2001a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2935.89	Um no , I have to bin it up and so I will only have counts for each each bin or something . 	EN2001a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2965.8	Yeah sure , you sure , we could do that , but I don't that makes sense . 	EN2001a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2978.15	If we need just frequencies , maybe we should just calculate them by using Perl or something . I don't know . 	EN2001a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Perl]
3493.64	Uh I can get all the raw text , but it has to be ordered still . So 	EN2001a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3575.35	Um we would have to look at that . 	EN2001a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4317.96	Print out . 	EN2001a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4358.74	Did you also order 	EN2001a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4871.04	No , how long you would have to program something . 	EN2001a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
109.82	Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy . We also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . Now 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
178.15	we will put inside the the remote . So uh it's a point to discuss . Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . But uh well 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
207.38	Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm]
311.88	Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote . You you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
348.1	Yeah and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy . But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy . 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
378.39	Yeah . And yeah and so can you go to the next slide please . So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said . 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
949.46	Yeah . That's a good idea . To have a help button . 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
956.8	On the T_V_ screen . On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote . 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1041.64	Uh well . So le le let's see what uh what people want . 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1540.18	Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find and when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1568.77	Put 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1689.65	Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that . 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1735.91	So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . 	IS1007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
310.87	Yeah . So then I continued with uh another uh paper that you are mentioning , L_P_ TRAP . So I just moving around with that ideas . And also uh the main idea today why I told maybe is like if you can list down what all things are there to be taken care of . Then one by one . Because finally face find I do have something else . 	IN1007.C.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[L_P, TRAP]
329.94	So uh maybe to list down the things other than the what I've already taken from you . And also to discuss generally . 	IN1007.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
452.47	So yeah , right now I have the feature extraction part where I can get the phoneme posteriors and through the neural net . So then I think I need yeah . Yeah , i yeah , but uh yeah , it's T_K_ through for some other task I've run it's T_K_ . So I have the general feel . But uh maybe I can take the interceptor from you and run it once on my to have it . 	IN1007.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
486.66	Yeah . Basically . So then I can can share what I ca have read and uh 	IN1007.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
501.9	So I'll use this . Yeah , the 	IN1007.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1016.09	Yeah , use maybe you can use the board for that , yeah . 	IN1007.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1423.25	To fit the the 	IN1007.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2169.27	Yeah . But I can come to yeah . Later . 	IN1007.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
281.03	You should write y the name I think . 	IS1001a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
683.59	And I I think we should have something , most of the time I I lose my remote control . We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping . 	IS1001a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s, T_V]
50.64	Well , I heard that there was a new uh component speech recognition component , which was pretty much up to standard , so we might use that I put that in my drawing , but again I didn't not have that much time . So 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
74.67	Okay , that's just super . Let me just 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
338.57	Of the remote control itself , okay . I was thinking along the line of one curve . I'll show that in my design . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
347.57	So we'll get back to that . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
382.89	Okay , I t I'd go for plastic because I have a couple of curves in my design . Well , g let's just get back to that . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
609.37	I have two designs , one including uh an L_C_D_ screen , wh which is basically the deluxe edition . And then I also have a standard edition , which wi we can also choose to develop too . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wi]
660.13	Yes , let me just 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
663.63	Get back . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
732.12	Well , they b they basically can have speech recognition . I mainly focused on the L_C_D_ uh aspect . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
787.76	And basically what you can see here is that it has a little , yeah , let's say gap which you can put your finger in . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
796.01	So you can you can hold it really comfortable , that's basically the idea . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
804.47	As you can see , this is the remote control 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
836.58	Yeah . I had to do this really fast . So excuse me for the uh inconvenience here , but as you can see , the keys moved . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
848.05	So these are basically the two types we have . So if we were to select the L_C_D_ screen , the transmitter here , you can see the light i 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
881.01	Well we can shift that . But normally , as you can see there , we put the uh number buttons right on top . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
922.07	Okay . So that's pretty much ha which I had in mind . As you can see here , this can be spaced for extra keys , which is the design thingys . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1153.28	What you can do is smooth the edges indeed . But that will bring extra c expenses . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1202.76	And we could have one here . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1341.47	you'd just like it to go a little bit more like this . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1475.32	To create a kind of disco effect when you 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1484.15	Light for the finding of the remote . We can also use one light for 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1518.75	Speech recognition , I where did I imagine . I did that pretty much over here , so that you could use it like this 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1527.78	and speak to it . Then you have the uh extra keys for teletext , mute , two buttons which can be pretty much anything or nothing . We can also just not use them . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1712.32	We could put our logo there . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1759.64	Because it's a little bit confusing to have twelve buttons down there , because you're only accustomed to eleven , I'd say . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1787.48	Well , you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1953.24	Or they can design their own cover . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1955.66	We could set up a a marketing uh agreement . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2019.8	Oh , basically the idea that I had was it to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter . 'Cause you can talk to it like this . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2282.03	Uh you could use it for the channels and for the volume . But it's has no real added value . 	TS3012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
694.41	well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , 	ES2013a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
11.81	Alright , yeah . crack on . Okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes . I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out . Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , 	ES2003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
60.28	um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . Um that pretty much sums up the last one . So we'll just crack on , um like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible . Um uh the con today is the concep today . This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is um 	ES2003c.B.words.xml	True	[today, today]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
111.35	Yeah , okay well I'll just uh I'll load it up then . Um . 	ES2003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1093.27	Excellent , right . Um uh . File open . 	ES2003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1387.56	Well , um I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway . You always have to bring out new designs , so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway . Um . 	ES2003c.B.words.xml	True	[year, next, year]	[]	[]
1472.46	say something like um lithium ion battery , the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now . Um 	ES2003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1787.41	Okay , this just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage . I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway . This is the conceptual one . Um . 	ES2003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1818.48	So for example , um I'll just start at the top , you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to , obviously . Um 	ES2003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
2063.94	programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ . I I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive . We don't know unless it would make sense to . 	ES2003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, P_C, _]
2132.94	It would make sense to . I would say to . Um and we'd better be careful about the time as well . We've already had the five minute warning , so . Um . I would say yeah . 	ES2003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2145.85	International would make sense . Um you're gonna look at product evaluation . I'm I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap . Um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say . Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay . Uh we'll see how that goes . Um . 	ES2003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[International]
2182.55	Yeah , I would s that would be my my feeling . 	ES2003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
573.89	Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it . 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
625.15	But uh we also have to stand out , 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . So make it just a different colour or different shape , so 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
736.75	just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
744.32	to find out . But there is already in a 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
748.3	one done . Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to . 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
806.13	Well uh what I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . So switch to channel six . So uh button six says says six . And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . Just numbers . That can be in the in the 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[six, six, six, in, a, row]	[]	[]
859.42	Um well play , pause . I dunno if that's usable when 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
909.49	Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time . 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
935.05	To just keep it simple and standard uh features . 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
944.53	Uh yeah mayb But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . But you can have a button that says um 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
975.67	So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1014.42	But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , so you have 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1049.36	Yeah well , that's that's I think that's the layers that produce . Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use . And later we can d uh do the design . 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1072.15	So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . Not just in in the row when you see 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1107.4	Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones . Oh . 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1334.05	So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1594.11	'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1638.37	Yeah , if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1821.04	Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern . 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1924.1	What But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever 	TS3004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
148.82	And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes yeah , I can change the vegetable . This one's broccoli . So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . 	ES2011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
181.89	So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . 	ES2011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
189.74	And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out . 	ES2011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
875.94	Wait a minute . I thought it was the other way round too . 	ES2011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
889.13	I'll just I'll just reverse them all . It's no problem . 	ES2011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
933.15	Say two . 	ES2011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1273.24	We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits . We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough . 	ES2011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1383.96	Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape . Um , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . 	ES2011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1849.51	It seems like way overkill . Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence . I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and 	ES2011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
273.26	Now where do I put the 	ES2003a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1002.36	Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of 	ES2003a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
25.46	Yes . Um my name is Dirk , Dirk Meinfeld . Um I will be uh Pr Project the Marketing Expert . And I will see what the user wants and uh what we can do uh with the new produ project product . 	TS3012a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Dirk, Dirk, Meinfeld, Pr, Marketing, Expert]
432.39	I will beat the dolphin . No . 	TS3012a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
809.2	say it uh 	TS3012a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
103.42	Actually uh you can t perhaps just uh just 	IN1009.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
740.63	Yes , also uh to to extract the context . 	IN1009.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
745.14	Mm because if you know the words that are spoken , you can let's say uh someone say uh he's angry uh about the word he's seen . Yes . 	IN1009.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
761.31	You mi you might want to add uh this kind of this is not in uh my project , but 	IN1009.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
794.53	And have a special events trigger if 	IN1009.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
891.06	Yes , um uh but in fact you have to sit in front of the microphone , and it's uh yeah , people one speak and people two and people three and you are just uh subtracting the the level that you you kept in the other microphones . 	IN1009.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1145.34	Sure , yes . And you can code Java . 	IN1009.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Java]
1154.94	You can choose Matlab . 	IN1009.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Matlab]
83.19	And I can start if you want . Mm . 	ES2011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
90.38	First . Okay . Um , how do I put this I'll just put the cable in . 	ES2011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
142.19	Oh wait , um . 	ES2011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
251.37	yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , 	ES2011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1057.2	You can hear it's under the couch yeah . Um , 	ES2011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1067.52	So need the other buttons . So we have this mm . 	ES2011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1195.8	of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of 	ES2011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1256.92	And then you can have um if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing 	ES2011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1280.6	Yeah , click o actually click on to have 	ES2011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1341.76	Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . 	ES2011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
317.75	I'll get it . 	TS3010d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
389.76	Oh , true or false . Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . Sorry . 	TS3010d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
560.05	Oh , we'll wait outside . 	TS3010d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
605.24	Say two . Two . 	TS3010d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
856.12	But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two . 	TS3010d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1243.94	And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour it's a normal colour , wh No one will see it . 	TS3010d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1306.67	Oh , wait wait wait . 	TS3010d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1336.1	Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have 	TS3010d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1412.19	So , all the buttons has to have to be the same colour . But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh 	TS3010d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
117.99	You see this beautiful presentation . Okay let's get started . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
125.0	Uh I sort of prepared this . Uh opening acquaintance , tool training , uh how to use the things here . Uh project plan discussion , and yeah then the rest of the meeting . Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
166.73	And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[the, end, of, the, day]	[]	[]
178.53	uh we should take some practice . I have some instructions now to do that . Uh well you know how to the documents work . So 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
195.3	we have a pen . And we can use this pen to perform . Yes . So 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
216.93	draw . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
231.31	Okay . Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
237.44	Uh you should explain 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
239.81	Uh with different colours and with different pen widths . And you should explain why you draw that particular animal . So , Julian . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Julian]
261.47	And use different colours etcetera . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
287.67	Yeah you can press the next button , which is uh yeah . I'll show you . Yeah . In file menu . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
328.17	Okay . Yeah pretty good . Uh could you press the next uh 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
676.8	Okay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer]
979.9	we can go ahead with what we have . I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
989.52	Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . And it seems you get more information by email . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
1035.22	Yeah . Y you do some individual work , we have meeting , individual work , meeting . And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . And then I have to prepare uh I have to defend our design , so make it good . I depend on you . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[the, end, of, the, day]	[]	[Y]
1074.21	requirements part . As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1094.2	You can always add a few 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1154.4	Yeah . We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features . So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . Yeah . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1200.58	Let's see what we got to do . 	TS3006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
54.47	Hi Kate . Okay , carry on . Alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting , I have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . Um and we should each have a presentation to make . Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . It's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . Okay . 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[the, beginning, of, the, third, twenty, five, after, two]	[]	[Kate]
102.16	Um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
150.39	And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . I think all of us agreed with those things . Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . Um and the new requirements that it for be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . Um 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[twelve, and, a, half]	[]	[Steph, Kate, Pence]
205.66	So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , but it still should meet those parameters . Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[fifteen, to, thirty, five]	[]	[T_V]
234.55	Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report . 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Steph]	[Sarah, ec, Kate]
281.51	Go back . 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
326.17	Um , did you do your Hit 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
657.72	Mm . Well actually some households do have three and four T_V_s and they would have a remote for each one , so . 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
800.88	Okay , we'll move the 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
977.27	Remember , we only have forty minutes 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1354.61	This time it should come up both . 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1830.38	Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow . 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1884.3	I wanna thank you all for all your presentations . We have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . So let's 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2174.69	Cover . Uh-huh . 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2254.05	Um this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Whew . And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can . Marketing they want product evaluation . Oh . Oh my , I'm sorry . 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2344.7	Go to it . 	ES2013c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
38.95	So , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm]
48.31	Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
59.08	So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
72.61	We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
108.75	We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
131.09	So now uh we will have three presentations . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ okay . And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer, U_I, Market, Expert]
157.29	So maybe we can start with uh industrial design . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
172.92	Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
338.71	Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
475.54	Well we will discuss that after maybe 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
910.13	Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1028.52	Yeah . I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . Maybe we can keep the banana . And it will be very easy to find . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1228.72	You can do both with both hands . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1268.91	I think for lefty it's okay . I can do this movement , and for righty as well . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1329.22	we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1343.27	And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[prodyuc]
1351.34	That is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay . It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1374.39	to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together . That would uh 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer, User, Interface, Designer]
1392.95	you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual . 	IS1001c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
875.68	Well , uh let me set this up . 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
906.81	So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys , um so it's good you went first , and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
951.43	And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort . 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
982.02	Oh yeah , yeah , that's true . Well maybe you could have a 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1055.19	I figured , just put 'em all together . 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1067.7	as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . Give it one button 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1084.53	Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1133.48	Yeah , yeah , we could do that too . Um , I hadn't thought of that . Yeah . 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1154.31	Right , so so the unirs the user interface uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1583.52	They're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel . Yeah , it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one . 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[two, years, ago]	[]	[]
1608.8	Right , right , and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , but if you can work around that that noise problem 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1643.87	Right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . What you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker , or not a remo I'm sorry , a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s . 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1673.01	Right , and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television . 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1681.57	Right , right . Um . Yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
2182.68	We could go comp yeah . We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball . 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2190.21	And it's got the thing on the inside . And there's no buttons at all , it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works . 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2197.93	And then ch children will love it . 	ES2005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1169.55	So maybe you and Bruno should take this office . 	IB4002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bruno]
1424.03	suggestion , if possible , we could move me and Yalina to the office where Andrei and Nancy are now . 	IB4002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Yalina]	[Andrei, Nancy]
475.44	Oh let's . 	IN1008.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
529.26	Yeah , I can just explain my project . It's completely different from this one . Well , it's also about tables , but the idea is if uh uh the several students come to a table with their laptops , they should be able to to share information easily . And uh in fact w what we we are doing now , we project um another screen on on the table , and different people are are are able to use their their mouse of their laptop to go to the to the project screen there and uh the project screen is just another Windows machine that is running . So you just have another f computer more or less you can use , but you can use it with your your own mouse and keyboard . 	IN1008.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Windows]
581.11	But uh in contrary to to having al another keyboard and mouse that only one person can use , now the different persons can use the the screen um at the same time with the with the mouse . 	IN1008.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[al]
948.74	Yes . Everything from um multi switch administration of uh audio and how you can uh analyse it , uh what information you can get out of speech and so on . So 	IN1008.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[multi, switch, administration]
1061.71	Probably it's uh it's f be a good idea if you have s two uh with um with source like uh books or web page centre . Give a lot of information how it is audio programming and so on works , cetera . Maybe you you know some at least a good book that's uh dealing with this stuff . 	IN1008.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1387.1	Well actually , just to have the the ICSLA e uh possibly to to branch ICSLA . 	IN1008.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ICSLA, ICSLA]
2558.09	I'll show you this afterwards . 	IN1008.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3070.63	Well , otherwise it could also just rely on the frequency band separation and detect that way the different persons and th then you don't really know where around the table these . But uh 	IN1008.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3099.65	That way you can separate where where is the the voice loud with uh or the loudest . 	IN1008.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
739.53	'Cause it I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better . 	TS3010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
744.84	And that might uh bring back the costs uh 	TS3010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
922.8	To get a feeling for this . 	TS3010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
925.67	Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . We uh aim at the younger market . So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . However , with trends it's always if there's it's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be uh can be totally different . 	TS3010c.D.words.xml	True	[next, year]	[]	[]
1067.09	Can make several uh concepts . 	TS3010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1525.51	Think we have we have now two buttons missing . The uh um 	TS3010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1534.21	We have two buttons missing . The mute button . And um , the to to uh have to uh numbers 	TS3010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
412.36	But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be flexible . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[al]
817.82	Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1074.15	We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1138.63	Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box . Five different 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1215.55	But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . Just only the basic uh 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1259.92	They can choose . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1291.15	Maybe put some different ones in it . Doesn't matter . It's just No , just some LED . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1297.77	Okay , cool . Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1681.09	Maybe you can make it like this . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1686.96	And this is all the wheel for volume . So that you just um It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one . Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1758.56	Next to each other . back and forth . So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . Because you have to hold it as well . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1901.7	Yeah , five . Let's give five . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1979.04	But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1986.23	Just round it up . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2233.98	But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy . Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Reaction]
2303.1	Okay , so just finish it . So we make it a bit like m that one probably . 	TS3004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
148.42	And the people that we have to place , uh you can see the list there along with their position and the project that they work on . And I guess the question the first question is how we want to organise people . Whether we want to do it by rank , or by project , or 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
282.88	So what I'd propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics , and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals , as to exactly where to put people . 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
325.46	So we should leave a space for that . And we can , because like I said maximum eighteen people in those rooms and there is only fifteen of us . And I don't know if you've noticed , but two of us are only here half the time . So Martin and David um are half the time at the E_P_F_L_ and half the time in Geneva . So 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Geneva]	[Martin, David, E_P_F_L, _]
349.09	sort of keep that in mind , I guess , when 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
542.77	Well , the third option is just completely mix everyone up , which some people say is better sort of for a group environment , so that you are not stuck only with the people who are working on your project . Right . So if you share an office with someone who's on a completely different project , you find out about that project , but you also sort of interact with other people on a more regular basis . 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
622.82	make an appointment for it . You just kind of go to someone's office and go down for a coffee or whatever . 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
757.78	Well , it's up to us how we do it . I can see benefits of both . 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
826.79	So take away three spaces and you're down to your fifteen , and you're right , if we do have a stagieur , whoever , who comes in , then we have nowhere Well , we can put them in the reading room , but that kind of defeats the purpose . 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
862.02	Or again find people who don't work the same hours . 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
965.04	Yeah , we could do that . 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1395.8	I think it's just a question of work conditions , like if you are a stagieur and you co only coming in for two months , then you can put up with it , but if you're there , you know , for the full year 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[two, months, the, full, year]	[]	[]
1489.42	So wait , we face the old town we face the old town now , and we are facing 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1644.6	Excuse me . Okay . Um . 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1658.24	that list as well . I'll put her in grey , I guess . 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1712.93	We can keep some of the people together that are together now , but 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1732.71	And then once we have more concrete ideas we can come back and finish it , 'cause if we just sit here and discuss , it's gonna take a long time and we're gonna start arguing and get cranky and 	IB4001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
30.38	Okay , here we are again . Detailed design oh , come on . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
46.96	Could open that anyway , think . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
114.69	Oh . Prototype presentation , well first you guys built the prototype . So you could could present that . But um let's see what be handy to do . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
327.38	Yeah , I could take out the push-buttons , but we need those . So , generally what I came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros , spe scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it , we'll just then we'll do it in black . We'll just deliver it in black , have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have , and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . You make it d orange or whatever you want . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[twelve, and, a, half]	[]	[Euros]
363.96	I'll just go back . Uh let's just let's see what okay , let's just see what we no , we we have to be under twelve and a half . It it's not uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , so . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
380.86	I think you that's what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together . So I think yeah , it's I think it's y one of the it's a good way to um 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
393.01	to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too . Just keep you just make new covers for the for it , like we agreed before . And everything that's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have . Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . But we need that for the L_C_D_ display . Then again , we have the L_C_D_ display , which is also expensive . B yeah , but those go together . And yeah , we could take out the curve . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _, L_C_D, _]
443.95	Took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers . So you can change any colour you want . So it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
467.45	You can take plastic , but I d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls , because they're all plastic . So which in in turn Rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Rubber]
494.89	I al like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour , which would make this black a black and grey . Yeah , that's that that that's enough , because 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
517.78	To ensure the profit . That that's th that's the order . We're just uh we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this . But that's not for our that's not our decision to take . We have a budget of twelve fifty per product . So 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
535.92	Stick that . I don't think it's really bad either . I mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
543.02	to have I think they would do . Th I think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea , because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want . So I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . So 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
662.88	I say lose the curve . Oh that's true , we could lose the c yeah , I forgot that , sorry . Uh the curve . So That's just this one just d this is the banana curve . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
689.77	Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . we could make it yellow then , but 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
706.75	So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak . So we keep the curve . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
817.53	Yeah , let's see if it sells . I mean I suppose this sells , because it's very very extended . But 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
913.01	Just create our own option . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
964.96	I'd use an remote control . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1015.88	So just make that a two . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1040.85	You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . I think so . I think it's perfect , the w where it is , what it can do , if it useful . I think so . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1099.64	But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . So that could be done by L_C_D_ display . I think it's good . No , maybe it's not a one because it's we're not using it perfectly . We didn't give it I don't thing over-discussing . Now we gave it enough thought though . I think we d should just lower this . Maybe maybe it's a three though . We could've used it more effectively probably . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
1165.33	Oh yeah Just to be a prick , but of course you can talk to your remote control , it doesn't do anything . But you c you can talk to it . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1178.58	Well , we did take everything into consideration of course . Uh the shape i shape is i 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1386.11	They sh they should get kids , and just stick 'em in T_V_ and say change the channel . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1411.96	So that's the final product without the speakers , I guess . Let's see , what was left in the the Another one . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1681.26	It would change , but not for me . So I'd I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually . I couldn't do any research myself or I see , that's yeah , w I could have done a little extra work probably , then 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1716.57	Should i if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget , we should celebrate . So 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1729.76	Uh okay , think that's about it . Uh 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1745.53	Okay , I should I think I sh I still have the the total report to finish up . I think we took very little time now , because 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1772.67	Just oh , think of a catchy name . I'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps . So 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1836.3	Step into the future of of remote controlling your T_V_ . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1847.0	Control your remote control . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1909.12	I take f yeah , take a banana . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1943.62	Just write out triple , like a word triple R_C_ , triple stripe Oh . Triple dash R_ dash s s C_ . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_C, _, s, s, C, _]
2067.17	Yeah , so we have everything . We have the product , we have the costs , we have the possibility of everything . Okay . I think it's adjourned . Retire to my lair and finish the report . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2091.92	Probably . See . Okay , goodbye . 	TS3012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
171.27	Go up . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
173.8	Yeah go up . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
178.67	No . Go back . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
198.09	Let's go and check . I'll go and check . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
240.6	Yeah , so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff . So there is one that is one thing . The other is the 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
255.96	the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever . Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
268.43	So I think it should be a package in that case . Uh so the user interface will consist of two parts . One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part . Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space , 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
325.42	Mm . Yeah and also parameter changing . So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
351.6	Voice command w we could specify anything . We could assign any button a command to any button , if we have enough processing power , I guess so . Yeah . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Voice]
677.55	It i can become painful you can have tendonditis . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
687.53	Ergonomic . But uh . Have to say ha ha . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1113.16	This will think this will take more time to develop also . Yeah . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1239.25	How muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no , one hundred thousand units . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1660.84	Well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that I can see 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1784.2	Maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands . Change channel to eight . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1836.12	Yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1854.56	Hey I just thought this thing there is a I mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this . Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel . Yeah . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1952.81	Well if it's going to delay yeah but uh it will be cool . It would . Because a user could say C_N_N_ for example and it would go C_N_N_ . Mm . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[C_N_N, Mm]
2087.3	So next time we should have a fight . 	IS1001b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
96.78	outline our ideas . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
142.41	ju just a thought . You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round , so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . But as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ju, L, _, _]
191.89	with uh plastic casing . Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . As for the um 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
471.74	I'd say number one . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
478.31	I think w if it was just the sounder then th I mean something I've found with uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w, m, dow]
1146.09	are actually quite straight . Um I mean yeah , on the on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it could just as easily be done um without curves . The curve that's really needed is up here , to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1225.61	Alright . B i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could , you know , say hello to , and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1307.19	Okay , well l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose . Because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1454.32	Mm . I'd give it a three for this for that . Yeah . I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote , but you see it in a lot of other places . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1484.61	I'd give it a three . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1516.91	I'd s I I'd give it a six , to be honest . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1533.86	Well I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours . Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow . If I were buying one , I'd go for purple . Leopard print would be cool . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1989.45	transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1993.41	computer ourselves . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2212.32	um m would make to sales . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2225.49	Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Wee]
2300.47	And I can get my bus . 	ES2003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
421.14	Could can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've 	ES2013b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1141.75	So , let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and 	ES2013b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
1192.28	do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . 	ES2013b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
84.84	'Scuse me . 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
507.96	So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
631.75	So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just I guess I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on . You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[arou, T_V]
654.56	'Cause you'll have to like but you can quickly s you can 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
673.31	So you're either you're you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
685.91	uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
723.22	I would think so too , like 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
726.18	So I mean and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of m yeah . 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
757.69	You can get to you know , you can 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
760.44	Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the yeah , yeah . 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
936.04	Mean 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
947.28	I mean you can do it , you it's it doesn't seem that hard . 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
993.28	So , do we need I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . That's what it does anyway . 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1134.34	Yeah . You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1329.62	So you could make that 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1366.67	We could promote the banana one . Like mm . 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1403.29	The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits . But uh it 	ES2011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
74.95	Help help help . 	TS3004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
590.22	Take it easy . 	TS3004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
746.53	Excuse me . 	TS3004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
965.79	O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control . 	TS3004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
981.49	Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small . 	TS3004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
988.97	Uh like a a to have Yeah , maybe it would . 	TS3004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1089.35	Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , or you can change your batteries , so . 	TS3004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1174.92	And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you can still uh do the th the functions . Yeah . But n yeah , but uh i basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so , so . 	TS3004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4.35	Just put it on the deskt desktop . 	ES2003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[deskt]	[]
155.15	Um , sh would you like to I'll just do it from here . 	ES2003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
166.37	Um , try second one maybe . 	ES2003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
174.96	Try it , yeah maybe . 	ES2003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
374.84	However , oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the 	ES2003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
387.64	in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . See , you could there're two options . Either you have voice recognition by itself , which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , you know , it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . As long as the voice recognition stuff works , that's that's fine . 	ES2003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
465.48	will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote , 'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , are you willing to have a bad remote control . And uh what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wanna use the T_V_ , they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you . Um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . Uh , will people return the remote control , I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so , do our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button , it's not a practical . So . These are things I think we should consider . I think it's cool , 	ES2003b.C.words.xml	True	[the, first, week, the, first, two, weeks]	[]	[T_V]
1920.53	Well I can give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often , I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface , right . You want the stuff . 	ES2003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
571.05	Okay , that's fine . Um . Okay , now work a little with me . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
580.92	Okay . Well , let's start it as it is . Okay , uh the method . There are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . Which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[programmeab, grammeale]
630.64	So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built . So it's that's not as easy as it s might look like . Uh material study , I'm working on that um for the the costs . I have to check out how far I can go with that . Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , I think we can just go on with that . Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
709.09	Uh here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . That makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Morse]
889.12	Go ahead . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
968.15	Okay , then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do . If not Okay . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1055.0	If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . That's fo is uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1313.33	Mm . But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . For instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it . Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1461.95	Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf . They they won't hear the the beep . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1660.25	You can uh put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1676.02	But I think that will cost a lot . Uh a normal wire would be better . Like a like a P_D_A_ , a hand-held . You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , you don't need basic station . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1759.79	Yeah . Exactly . I think this is a brilliant product . I would buy it myself . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1808.05	I would like to make a decision . What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it and exactly , I need it . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2208.87	No . M I personally would prefer it on the top . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M]
2235.11	We should just try to make that if it's possible . If it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2243.12	Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
2306.21	If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . It is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two . That might be an option . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2390.26	I'll try to . 	TS3012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
93.57	This'll just take a moment . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
123.12	Okay we'll have to deal with it like this then . Alright . Um . This is the first meeting uh for developing our , our new product . I'm Heather , I'm your Project Manager . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Heather, Project, Manager]
139.08	Okay . So um . So that was the opening . The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
209.56	Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing . But um um 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
223.04	is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , uh , create this product , and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , uh Which brings us to our next subject , is , um , um , as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
249.36	Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
309.07	Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
319.28	come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . Same with conceptual design and detailed design . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
348.34	to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . Um , tool training . Is , is everyone , um 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
363.07	One thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . Um , one of them is our whiteboard . And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . Um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . So , um , I , I'm assuming that we should do that now . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
417.4	Do come up . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
475.14	Do you have 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
494.62	Okay . That's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , that um , that um In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
524.08	it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
550.35	Right , I'm gonna take minutes while , um , you guys express your favourite animals . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
826.78	So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
863.66	we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
871.49	to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market . Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro, M, _, Euro]
1026.27	Any ideas will do that you have at this point . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1034.15	Can hold it . Yeah . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1038.47	Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for . I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1080.39	Right . Okay we have five minutes left . So , just to cover We have one more thing . Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . Or not present but bring to the meeting . Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for . 	ES2015a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[I_D]
78.41	Suppose I have to do my presentation . Eh um 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
85.57	So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager . 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ada, Longmund]
94.12	So um we will have to 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
101.51	um speak about m the project . Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly . 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
172.02	Maybe you can draw your favourite animal 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
175.54	and make a list of its favourite characteristics . 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
246.85	And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
254.4	so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do . And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications . 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
296.6	So I will manage all all the group . 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
353.09	And i maybe you will transform it . 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
779.67	Just have to 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
781.76	present project , discuss a little bit about it . 	IS1003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
53.41	Okay , hang on , reply coming . Yeah , it's okay . U oh , I hate these things . 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
740.05	Yeah , sure . We s go straight to the semantics of the yep . 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[yep]
2142.53	Yeah , but let's pretend that it's not going to happen in any foreseeable future . Wh uh the I mean I'm just thinking from practical perspectives , you'd you'd have to the the AMI recognition system that we have now is either for these microphones or for the microphone array . There's no lapel system trained for instance . So I mean that in itself , it would I mean you'd have some fun training some more speech recognition models . But 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Wh, AMI]
2345.59	Yeah , but I'm I'm meaning if you move on to these corpora , yeah . So you might wanna be doing something else basically , yeah . 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2629.46	Although I remember discussing this like um 'cause uh when Neville was working on his his stuff , which was just based on the slides , if um he he asked me all you know , could I pre-segment the slides for him uh , you know , because you wanted to s you wanted to have the topic segmentation . And I said well just look at the the headings . Because anybody generally who writes the slides yeah . It's not okay . It's true for me then . Okay . 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Neville]
2848.66	Yeah . After the after the hard drive crash we took the time to actually rebuild the the the system and actually train 'cause originally we sort of had the idea of oh we'll use a recognizer that's been trained on a large amount of telephone speech data and that should give us a better result . I just as a contrast , I trained one specifically on this data . Results were almost identical um which says to me there's something wrong with the data rather than and it's nothing serious . It's simply that it hasn't been um chunked it or or segmented in a way that's typical of speech resources . in terms of um you can have like uh a two second utterance , uh credit cards , and then twenty seconds of silence coming after it , which in which when you f when you first think about it , you just think oh silence , whatever , nothing will happen . But a lot of the normalization that we use 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2904.67	Uh yeah , C_M_S_ C_ C_V_N_ . Uh so w we need a decent end point detection system running before we can we can we can do that . And we're converging on having one now just in in sort of tandem with this development of this web based recognizer . Um but of course unfortunately all these things take time . Um but I I think we should see a decent sort of improvement then . Not just in terms of no longer having recognition errors whenever silence appears . 'Cause you get that immediate benefit that you don't have any insertion errors . But also it should actually affect the recognition on the speech segments as well . 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, _]
3012.99	Y yeah . But one can imagine a commercial system uh that that that s Steven Cox used from Nuance probably had all these things , built in end point detection , et cetera , et cetera . So 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y, Steven, Cox, Nuance, et]
3091.03	Mm okay , this is f okay . Okay . We can just run some generic yeah . 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3272.36	Yeah , sure . But I mean this is once again a very constrained task again . I mean it's it's it's you you're almost assured it's only gonna be a single speaker on the microphone . So I mean the the only sorts of noise you're gonna have to deal with uh is is is hiss or impulsive I would say . Or or that would be a good start . 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3348.47	apply some pressure . 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3410.2	Yeah . And it's nice to get some feedback on I mean that feedback will probably come after your proposal possibly . But um 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3444.81	N yeah , sort out any bugs or whatever . Yeah . 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3453.58	Yeah . I I I'd prefer to go back to the C_T_S_ models I think as well 'cause I think I think they did work a little bit better . So yeah . 	IN1016.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[C_T_S]
29.17	Okay . That's possible on uh this time of day . Starts at three o'clock . Uh Uh , let me see . Our fourth and last meeting . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
55.7	Okay this our last meeting . In this meeting we will discuss our final design . And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . And then we're going to close the project today as well . So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
80.95	And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . Um , in order to do that we have this agenda . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
101.36	We'll have the prototype presentation first . Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . Then we will look at the finance . Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . Because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
129.42	But we will see that later . Then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that . We've got forty minutes . So we will be finished at half past three . But first um 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[half, past, three]	[]	[]
145.8	we will do the this is prototype presentation . So , if some yeah if somebody wants step forward . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
425.16	Okay . That's nice . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
482.04	to save there . Here we have the single curves . Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um , 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
523.09	So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um , 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
634.97	So And it's good for the design as well . So you can make 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
639.82	Uh let's see . If you make this 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
863.08	Say Or you can take the single chip . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
909.76	Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
952.17	um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
965.64	Alright . It's gotta scroll and push . Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
987.62	But it would definitely crop cost , a lot . And we need the battery . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1008.79	It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay . And we can save a Euro by a flat design . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
1101.86	I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1120.92	Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1133.17	And it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1252.0	And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1271.82	Plus scroll . That's right . So we've got one , two , three . Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1313.32	decrease this one to four buttons . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1384.48	Ask for more money . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1393.81	Yeah . But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more . So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . It will be necessary to have good help function , as well . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1485.54	That's right . We can let l We can stick it out , a bit . Like a old old buttons . Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . Yeah . That's a good one . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1499.52	So , I'm afraid we have to move on . And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh But we will see . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1524.95	I would buy it . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1540.66	No . But we can go on with the project evaluation . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1549.64	Let's see . I can sit down I think . We still have fifteen minutes left , so we're nice on schedule . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1573.09	There we are . Evaluation criteria . Go ahead . We've got five minutes I think for those criteria . No we've got fifteen minutes but 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1730.37	I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1752.87	Think it's uh seven . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1823.91	I would give it a four . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2182.59	But I think you can Yeah . Should be possible . Yeah you can export it as image . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2256.09	Yeah . So everybody puts his own score . And then it mediates the score , and you can get one Yeah . That's better . So that's uh 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2378.12	You can do more . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2385.17	Just put it on the market for everybody . You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . That's one thing you can change it with . So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works . That's I think a good advantage . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2451.41	Then we still have some questions . If somebody has some questions they can ask them now . Or we can put these in the project folder as well . Maybe that's 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2529.39	Yeah , I'll just put it in My Documents and uh That's okay . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2568.98	Yeah . Questionnaire . I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room . And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes , or something . Okay . Thank you . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Questionnaire]
2583.63	Hopefully my pen will download its software . 	TS3003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
0.2	Help . 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
85.93	I'll go over what we decided last meeting , 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
131.42	have a bit of oh oh you can see it , okay . Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . Um 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
144.85	want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . We discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that . 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
179.07	Unplug me . 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
535.92	Or , maybe move the laptop over . 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
844.9	Look at that . 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1200.74	We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing um because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1452.56	I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um . 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1625.8	We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1638.84	because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that , it's just a number . 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	True	[two, days]	[]	[]
2043.22	for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2121.65	Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . You could have different kind of casings . So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and 	ES2004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
110.47	Today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design . 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[Today]	[]	[]
131.68	take some minutes uh again . Um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented . 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
208.86	So did you manage uh 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
539.88	Yes well maybe Matthew can can give some more information on the 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Matthew]
560.88	Maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel of uh I've it was a good idea maybe to to 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
609.8	Yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get uh after-sales I mean that would would be very good I mean those covers could go for for three , five Euro . 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
631.44	maybe uh we can go a th Matthew's presentation because 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[th, Matthew]
641.01	Together indeed uh , because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use , what you were already mentioning . 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
1068.17	We have to consider it . S so do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition , I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
1403.44	Well well m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case . I mean just what 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1592.26	So I f I think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this . Um so I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1617.0	we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features . 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1639.06	So when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip . 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1687.64	Mm yes wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . That w that would be a very good idea . 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
1728.72	Yes but I can I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials which which come with a with another price . 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1806.6	Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs , one one 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1828.98	with addit uh additional uh , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it . But that that that that can be done later . We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control . 	IS1000c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
459.9	Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . Um , however that's gonna cost more , but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert , so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . And that pretty much sums it up . 	ES2012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
902.36	Yeah , I I would say we do , yeah . 	ES2012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1102.21	Ye yeah , 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different . You'd know what you were fiddling with . 	ES2012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1315.2	Well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , yeah . 	ES2012c.B.words.xml	True	[this, year, next, year]	[]	[]
1526.85	And that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly . Yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly . 	ES2012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1714.39	Yeah , you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip . So maybe it'd be 	ES2012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1725.95	Yeah , and fiddle around with it and press it . 	ES2012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1733.46	Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle an yeah . 	ES2012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1790.0	But do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that and it's microphone-esque , yeah , yeah . 	ES2012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1832.36	Well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . I mean uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness and and sc and then you can you can minimise the buttons and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff . 	ES2012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1876.59	But the television would be the display that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah . 	ES2012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1933.63	Play with play-dough . 	ES2012c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
605.35	So I can draw , but uh 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
657.64	Well uh you can guess what it is , I hope . 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
748.4	You can try out the eraser now . 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
854.77	Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls . Yes , perhaps you can integrate them or something . 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
894.0	Yeah . You should just give it to . 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
958.8	But if if it's if it's international you should uh look in think in Britain they have uh different things they can do with the T_V_ , or so uh that you can choose what you want to see . I dunno if you should uh take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal T_V_s that uh 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Britain]	[T_V, T_V_s]
996.63	Yeah , we can leave that . 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1073.91	Yeah , you can choose the code . 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1128.34	Guess not . 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1163.38	Yeah meeting will close in five minutes . 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1203.3	So I should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote , or uh , or how I don't really 	TS3005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
960.05	It's a very simple device , technically speaking . So this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . 	TS3003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
985.58	Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . 	TS3003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1364.66	Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think . We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . We just 	TS3003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1380.68	change our focus on the project , and I think 	TS3003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1385.01	we can uh we can sell this . 	TS3003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
363.16	I'll give it a one . 	ES2010d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
934.34	Let you loose . 	ES2010d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
448.8	Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes to make T_V_ remotes . 	ES2012a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
575.16	Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't 	ES2012a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_V, _]
628.08	to make make people aware of the product . 	ES2012a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1005.4	Um , well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with like you buy it with several 	ES2012a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1020.01	you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , but uh maybe thinking of that , it's considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it . Unless you were trying to 	ES2012a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
664.93	And so think of this concept . 	ES2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
764.34	Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them , so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . Um should avoid s things like that . Um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . 	ES2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
786.99	Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea . 	ES2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
830.01	Um we should definitely avoid the big square block look . That's just wrong . 	ES2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1722.72	So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . 	ES2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
255.22	Just press the okay button , it works . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
315.11	Oh wait uh wait up . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
653.55	Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier . So m 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
670.13	Yes . But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
719.67	Okay , but I'll I'll go into that , because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
794.02	it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source . Which brings me to the different energy sources . Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls . You really have to imagine like winding up your uh I d 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[dyn, dynamos]
848.64	It would be very new , but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think . Uh Well , this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish . It have it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[kinetic]
948.08	So , but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[energy]
966.83	Uh yes , it does . I'll come to that later . And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1205.86	Yeah , yeah . Okay . Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved . There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1357.37	to think about . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1378.47	Okay . Okay , well my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper . So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries . Otherwise it will not too advanced , uh well . It's in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries . But 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1455.86	So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff , and we should uh use wood or something like that . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1537.55	It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . It's very unlogical . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1606.95	Yes , yes . And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part . I don't think it it's any uh value added thing . So 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
1724.52	Yes , they can work . They cannot work with double-curved . That's that's problem . I'll check it for you . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1799.73	I'll do . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2005.29	Well uh you can use well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too . So it has th the spongy uh feel also . So I I think that's okay . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2125.44	Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . So maybe they can combine these two . 	TS3011c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1.99	Okay . Yeah . I mean m my view on this was that um the need for people to back up their data personally was made sufficiently clear to lab users . Um I mean I guess right , okay . As long as she admits it , then then that's fine . I I'm just thinking , you know , sometimes when there's a a process error like that , you think oh , then there's something we should change . Like make the sign in bigger red letters . But I in the our case , I don't think there's anything more we can do really . So Um well , I doubt anybody'll do that again 'cause that'll get around . So 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
104.79	To actually do the re-install . You c 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
253.09	This seems the sort of thing that people might might find i find amusing to look at . So um I I'll I'll see if if she'd be willing to 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
287.14	Uh right , what am I writing . Uh okay , Nynke to volunteer . Well uh no uh I will actually give her the the option . But um it sounds like the kind of thing where , you know , I think it's quite useful when you're at that stage to see the different kinds of technologies people use . So 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nynke]
464.18	Just change it . Mm-hmm . 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
476.2	Yeah . Although if if you had a big thing and it was jiggling around like anybody's business , like real eye track traces , then you might find that a little bit disconcerting . I mean small things you kind of expect to jiggle around , right . But 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
496.89	It'll look like it's quivering , you know . Yeah , but well , that's all fine . . 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
519.37	Oh , remind me . Oh yes . Okay . 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
651.24	Okay , but they may need help finding the something if they can't do X_ fig , I suppose . 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
797.9	Yeah . Um I mean you know , some f rainy day you might wanna think about 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1038.37	Yeah . Well , she'll have to u use the C_V_S_ eventually 'cause we don't really have a good way of doing this otherwise . But 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[C_V_S, _]
1216.87	Um I'll have to look . I can't remember um how this works now 'cause it was a while ago . 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1353.95	Yeah . So um is that gonna have a voice-over or is it we had discussions before you started about whether it should be completely silent so that they could use in case we ever wanted to do this in in Dutch , yeah . And uh and so , you know , you could just have sort of well the I think we discussed having it with an English voice-over or having it with no voice-over and then having it w just with cartoon noises or something like or you know when things break . So to emphasise the I may be imagining it . 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Dutch]
1393.96	Oh , so we could produce a Dutch voice-over for the same thing . Yeah . 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1485.37	Or or you could just point to you know , have b great big arrow that points at the two pieces that broke . 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1593.66	Oh , but it's so tactile to have the little metal bits . If you if you're using it , keep it . He's got plenty of toys . If you're not if you're not using it , then I'll take it back . 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1860.11	Yeah , so you might wanna try and come . If you get that far , try and come equipped with a list of the kinds of things you want out of it and and so we can look through and see . Um uh y Ellen might have views on what kinds of things once we have a list , right . So so Yeah . So , but it'd be good to , you know , make sure once we have a list of the things that we think we're getting of it that it matches her intentions for what we were supposed to get out of it . So um , you know , if we do talk about that , then it might be nice to have her along for it . 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y, Ellen]
2170.7	I've got o uh one thing to check and one person to ask if she'll volunteer to be a head . And as far as I know that's it for me . See , I have to explain . I'm for for one of my other things I there is now a specific Wiki page that says stuff Jean has to do . And I'm beginning to think that this is quite a good idea 'cause I worry about not doing the stuff people expect of me . Much more than the other way around , right . 	EN2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Wiki, Jean]
973.84	Yeah . Put it colours . Maybe it would help us . 	IS1000a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
134.79	I see , right . That's nice to know , one from each of you . Um new project requirements . Um so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to um 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
192.39	I guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations . So we'll start with yourself on the basis that uh 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
727.85	Well there's a couple of things there . Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product . 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
819.51	Well th the on the Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . But but 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
913.94	Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut down your time . Anyway . 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
945.31	Whatever . Okay . Okay . Limit the number of buttons , user friendly . 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
964.02	Well that's true , yeah , you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , that that makes sense . 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1383.67	Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . But if you 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1406.2	You'd want to try and av just have the one product that if 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1416.52	Yeah . Um I dunno um talking about vo I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be . But you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1643.88	And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting . Do it via the email so that rather than coming you know If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . Come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate . But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their uh on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting . Okay . 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[des]
1696.91	I would guess so . 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2054.23	data functions hidden at back . Can bring out when needed . 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2292.32	Well you might get some research . 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2299.43	Okay . Right so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting . And we'll meet back at I'm not sure . Um forty minutes , I believe is the time . 	ES2014b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
105.79	So here's an agenda . Uh I'll open . Um you should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as I was struggling to our last time uh and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation . Uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful . 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
128.03	Um now you can all give your presentations . We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions . Right , forty minutes for this meeting , so a bit more time than the last one . 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
152.1	So does anyone have any overall 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
353.19	So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . That's 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
580.69	I can give you that to click on . 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
750.6	Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example . So that might play on what we can do . 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
794.24	Well there there is a for example on digital T_V_ systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example . A a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can Yeah , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that . They're just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext . So now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle . 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, T_V, _]
840.12	But still there there's an opportunity . If if it's , for example , a trainable one then we're just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it . 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
884.71	I'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[teletext]
1098.55	But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this . Be a good idea . Uh sorry , I didn't mean to cut in . I'm not the boss . Okay . 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1525.0	We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1555.45	Yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1908.56	Well I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it . 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1918.4	If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it , but we're really doing that to sell the brand . Yep we have five minutes left . 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1929.41	Uh rather th uh to to to sell for Real Reactions . And I can communicate this to to the more senior uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction . 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm]
2249.61	The last remote you'll ever buy . 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2278.35	Um need to look into whether we can do that but uh I think we we have some m mobile phone-based products uh checking quickly our Internet . We really need to finish up here . But uh 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2309.32	Yeah I think so , without it being too In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here . 	IS1002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
176.57	Um and according to Rolling Stone it's the freshest , funniest and scariest crime thril thriller to come along since Pulp Fiction . Uh The Sixth Sense on the other hand is a more commercial movie with its famous line , I see dead people . Um it was written and directed by M_ Night uh Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis , Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette , and it's about a little boy who sees dead people and i he sees a child psychologist to try to get him to understand why he sees the dead people , what it means . 	IB4011.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Rolling, Stone, Pulp, Fiction, Sixth, M, _, Night, Shyamalan, Bruce, Willis, Haley, Joel, Osment, Toni, Collette]
234.44	Send your complaints to Rolling Stone . So on the next couple of slides I'll just go through some of um more detailed stuff that we might need for administrative purposes . Um the length for The Usual Suspects um is a hundred and five minutes . Uh as you can s well , as Andrei already said , it's n nineteen ninety five . It has an R_ rating , which means that at least in the in North America it was not recommended for people under eighteen , 'cause it's fairly violent , but not so violent as other movies . Um plot outline uh five villains in New York are rounded up by the police in an unconventional manner that worries them . After release they get together for a spot of revenge , but someone else is controlling events . And the big mystery of the movie is who's controlling the events . 	IB4011.A.words.xml	True	[nineteen, ninety, five]	[New, York]	[Rolling, Stone, Suspects, Andrei, North, America]
464.04	Let it's a sort of different style from the other movies we've seen , and they have a twist , so it's not your general movie where you just kind of sit through it and go , oh okay , get up and leave . It's at least out of those two movies I came out thinking , oh cool , okay . 	IB4011.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1182.52	Well let's go through the other suggestions . 	IB4011.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1432.21	Yeah , but you'd get a different impression if you had bright blue sky and bright sunshine behind it . 	IB4011.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1928.76	And then maybe replace the paragraph that you had on the first poster with either shorter sort of descriptions , not even of the whole plot , but just descriptions of the movie or 'cause I think that paragraph is too long , people don't r generally just stand there and then read the whole thing . 	IB4011.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2089.28	Um I'd go for Sixth Sense , just because it's different from all the other ones and 	IB4011.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sixth, Sense]
2217.72	I'll give two to American Beauty and 	IB4011.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[American, Beauty]
2248.24	Well you can keep the format , I mean th you didn't have that many graphics in the first one . 	IB4011.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2352.26	We can ask people casually , sort of what genre of movie they want , or 	IB4011.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2361.62	Start again . 	IB4011.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2363.4	Or go back to the fifties . 	IB4011.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
647.84	Okay um I'll do some 	ES2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
653.53	I'll rub the features and let the drawing stay . 	ES2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
687.43	Yeah , that'll do . Okay , so let let me draw the body first . 	ES2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1055.43	I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . 	ES2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm]
1145.15	And then use the 	ES2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1188.84	Uh we can aim for I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um 	ES2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
394.06	M yeah , like a lot of a lot of what I've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over . So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research . But anyway , um we might come to that later . 	ES2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M, Craig]
560.01	Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . And others that are uh also available and then others that are concealed . Something like that . 	ES2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sorta, w, w, un]
782.46	Okay . Just um Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing . And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide and do you know what I mean , so . 	ES2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
863.84	Dunno . Okay . Um . So this is what I've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together . Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . So they find them ugly . Most people find them ugly . Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . Okay I'm gonna we'll look at that in a second . Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them . 	ES2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
960.18	and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for . 	ES2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1065.96	Yeah . That's s that's sort of the um But I I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . But not let that confine us technologically . 	ES2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1218.89	Yep . It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , in terms of 	ES2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
115.4	Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the . 	TS3011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
703.81	Okay , make 	TS3011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
717.51	Of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million . 	TS3011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
748.04	Uh well , skip this . 	TS3011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
813.7	Uh mo uh zap buttons most . Volume , they are uh use a lot . But 	TS3011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[zap]
908.45	And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ , and it's 	TS3011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, _, T_V]
954.34	So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep . 	TS3011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1342.82	And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . 	TS3011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1600.19	And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . So 	TS3011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1857.48	So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people . But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . So 	TS3011b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
143.52	Yes . Exactly . So we can go to next . Okay . So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . So I don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . I don't know really , I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you'd want like a softer touch . I mean do you guys know what I mean . Yeah . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[last, year]	[Milan, Paris]	[]
200.96	Okay . Awesome . Um so design preferences , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb . Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . That's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
230.08	And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something . Actually right here . So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . 'Cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's cool . So it's classically retro . So I mean that's just an idea if you guys like it . And , yep . And that's it . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[retro]
885.11	Yeah , like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options . So that way the remote reads it . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
933.28	the better it'll sell . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
991.01	We need to decide , well so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want and exactly 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1018.71	So we can make it small if we have a l locating device . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1098.35	A phone , whoa , that would wow , that would hurt . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1133.72	We could do that , because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1206.09	O or we could like take off this . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1266.58	Ooh . Uh see I'm uh I'm strangely attracted to it , because I know that's it's definitely gonna be big , because it's , I don't know , it's just so high-tech . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1289.33	Oh , then maybe voice 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1304.15	But do can your can the department make 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1333.01	I mean more more come in a package . Yeah . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1370.02	We could think about it and come back to it next meeting . We still have one more meeting . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1470.6	Well , you could do some on both sides . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1484.93	have buttons . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1715.72	Well , some of those buttons though are blue-based . Um well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based . Well , kind of . Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . Like if we like the one all the way on the left , uh you ca you can see it on your computer better . Um where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons . 	ES2010c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
182.45	Yep . Visit it . 	TS3003a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
849.35	Come on . 	TS3003a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
888.55	Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer . 	TS3003a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer]
1374.24	Think it has to be shock proof 	TS3003a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1401.49	Yeah , one other little thing . Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it . 	TS3003a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1408.75	So you can see 	TS3003a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1414.32	But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too . 	TS3003a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
18.69	we'll just go through the the final uh the final details . Um okay , oh the um 	ES2012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
49.02	uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close . Um 	ES2012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
182.91	Okay for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but uh uh 	ES2012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
192.12	Yeah , uh no because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item uh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh 	ES2012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
396.47	l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . Um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh um just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . Um and uh 	ES2012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
470.67	uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so uh um you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , so uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . Um . 	ES2012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
521.16	Does anybody want to uh uh Andrew do you want what do you want to say about um 	ES2012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Andrew]
761.94	It will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's it's uh yeah yeah so I I yeah I 	ES2012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
826.25	Need a need a calculator for that . 	ES2012d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
87.9	Let's see what we can find here . 	TS3005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
153.41	You can go first , okay . 	TS3005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
171.4	I_E_ E_I_E_ , okay . Thank you . 	TS3005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, E_I_E, _]
911.91	Should be in there . Well , I can tell you them uh from my laptop . Um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and of course would make it more costly , I think . Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . So we have to keep that in mind . Um well uh according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . 	TS3005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[teletext]
1063.83	Uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers uh of forty plus . 	TS3005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1351.73	Yeah , and maybe you can make something fancy out of an L_C_D_ remote , because it's new , as far as I know . 	TS3005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1405.94	Mm-hmm . Yeah , and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext . 	TS3005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1817.27	Okay , just make a separate remote for each uh 	TS3005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2121.03	And a see-through uh 	TS3005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2355.98	postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , because we're running out of time . Um for now , we're having a lunch break , 	TS3005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2364.8	and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work . I will uh write uh minutes , if I can create them out of this . And uh put them in the the project documents uh folder . And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles . And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach . 	TS3005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1076.01	Oh I would keep it as a candidate , but I don't know , I think for the moment m m guess most of these are candidates , so we'll try to . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1085.11	Yeah , we should probably vote after everyone 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1132.93	I you you recognise them , or you can read the the text on the images . Oh okay . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1255.35	Yeah , that's basically the point , yeah . Mm-hmm . So on the picture you can see uh Jodie Foster and uh ha ha . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Jodie, Foster]
1520.74	Yeah . Uh regarding the Denis's table I would say given that this site , I don't know if it's mainly American , but uh I would say that 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Denis]
1540.16	Yeah , but I would say mainstream are the ones that have more than , whatever , sixty thousand votes , and you can see some more , well , confidential films that have like ten thousand , twenty thousand , like mm Princess Mononoke , twenty thousand and uh , whatever , the the Kieslowski at eleven thousand , the Trois Coleurs Rouge . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm, Princess, Mononoke, Kieslowski, Trois, Coleurs, Rouge]
1593.91	Yeah , let's uh 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1661.52	um would keep this more or less this theme of uh history and war and action drama , while showing actually a very new and I would say humanistic view on on war . Because it's it's not like the sort of glorification of uh , you know , the good guys that that uh well go against the Nazis , but uh it's uh it's well the plot actually if you don't know it 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nazis]
1849.56	Um okay , so um yeah , that's that's the point , it's it's a bit grey , and actually if you look at my second page , uh in the trivia I found out that in fact they uh actually reduced the the colour saturation of the movie , just to make it look maybe a bit like the documentaries from the time . Yeah , I was very surprised to find this uh it's 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1883.06	Yeah . So this uh fact number two I think obviously for I mean technical people like us is uh is is is quite funny . So yeah , so I I mean these four points could serve also as an introduction if you want to talk f fo for fi five or ten minutes before the movie , I don't know , in in the room . So uh yeah , mm so tha this would be my candidate , but I'm very much open to 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2526.24	Wh what about a brighter background , because this one , I don't know how it would show on a wall or something like this . It doesn't really catch your attention . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2584.55	I I would suggest 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2624.61	Yeah . Well you can nominate one or two , so that we or whatever . Um I would nominate , well okay , my candidate , Saving Private Ryan . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Saving, Private, Ryan]
2636.68	And uh I'm happy with your nominations too . Uh I would nominate also Pulp Fiction , because it's a very good movie . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pulp, Fiction]
2685.3	so we have uh seven candidates . Um if you have a good short term memory that should be okay . Yeah . So uh Big Lebowski , Usual Suspects , Saving Private Ryan , Pulp Fiction , American Beauty , Schindler's List and Silence of the Lambs . So now let's vote . Should we vote just for one film or should each of us say give 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Big, Lebowski, Suspects, Saving, Private, Ryan, Pulp, Fiction, American, Beauty, Schindler, Silence, Lambs]
2723.67	Uh you can write on your paper maybe . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2756.77	Okay . I will just remove it this way . Um um 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2764.82	I would remove Schindler's List because it's too sad . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Schindler]
2785.35	No , no . Well I mean leave someth okay , so we're left with The Big Lebowski , Usual Suspects , Saving Private Ryan and American Beauty . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[someth, Big, Lebowski, Suspects, Saving, Private, Ryan, American, Beauty]
2798.12	Okay , so let's vote just simply for one , for the moment . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2803.02	So I would vote for American Beauty , because I haven't seen it . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[American, Beauty]
2839.36	yeah , you can choose . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2883.16	Well , beginning of May I guess , to choose the film for May . Is that 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[May]	[]	[May]
2902.64	Yeah , we can do it like the Tuesday before the Ascensions and that's May third . 	IB4010.B.words.xml	True	[Tuesday, May, third]	[]	[Ascensions]
53.96	Yeah , put it back . 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
722.95	Basically this is what we've talked about already , um , from the marketing point of view . We just wanna make sure that we've taken into account Yep . 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Yep]
792.18	So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . Not sure how this is gonna come out . 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
870.36	Okay so look and feel , innovation 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
984.75	S yeah . Get that one . Um w one's bad and seven's the best . Sorry , one's true and seven's false . One's the best . 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
1204.53	I'd say two or three for that one , personally . 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1514.28	If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being applying to the the demographic yeah . That's it's still Ye 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ye]
1631.04	I'd probably go with three again for that one . 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1898.9	Well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . That'll basically take us down to the budget . 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2040.34	So it would need twelve buttons . 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2070.1	So we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . They're not just standard buttons . 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2528.47	With these new costings . So just look at forget that one and look at that one now . 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2553.14	Yep . So w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment . 	IS1000d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
377.76	Shall I see if I can get across without just tangling everything . 	ES2014a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
392.93	'Kay uh pens are over here . I'll try the red pen . 	ES2014a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
411.05	I'll have a bash at it . 	ES2014a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
430.82	We'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear . 	ES2014a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1042.52	slide four 	ES2014a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1109.09	I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control , so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise . 	ES2014a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
540.57	Yep . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
767.24	Another question is like sorry . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1111.24	Second thing is yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . So is that feature available in like uh titanium , or it's like only specific to plastic or 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[chilli]
1349.89	Absolutely , f for somebody who very often , if he would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1380.42	And just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1489.98	would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1538.58	I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ch]
1580.12	Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1658.63	Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . All are confusing and in inconsistent . Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1708.98	So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1760.16	This is central one , the one you yeah volume and channel . So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1877.46	Maybe we could start with the black and white . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1880.73	That that way we could upgrade later . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1977.09	For the body design I think plastic , uh w yeah we could use the body , for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2122.88	Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2130.84	And finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside , it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time . 	ES2004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
430.954	So just walk through it step by step . I mean , is it fancy , everything I believe uh 	TS3011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
862.1439999999999	Well , just give it a two . 	TS3011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
928.944	have the solar , I think . 	TS3011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1118.224	Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four 	TS3011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1397.664	I'll give a two . 	TS3011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1751.214	You to take in account that your you m yeah uh 	TS3011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1875.164	But y you can if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . So it's almost yeah . 	TS3011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2145.4139999999998	Leave it here . 	TS3011d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
555.95	Then you can connect this one or this one yeah . 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
819.03	Now you can move I think yeah . 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
832.88	It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , go to the . 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1099.52	But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1178.82	But you should be careful , people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s , so basically through all the things . So maybe we should think of yeah . 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1201.23	Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all . 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1221.52	Okay . So I can take I think mine now there . Okay so voila . Hmm I can take mine it's okay , voila , mm so mm . 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1365.84	And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but uh uh . Then there is uh this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing , um which which you can vouch . 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1427.42	And then whi which is generally used by the people . And then well personal preferences I would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, T_V, f]
1481.66	Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option and you could play it or You can also think about having like um 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[V_C_R]
1508.75	I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program . In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities . 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[a, few, days]	[]	[]
1596.96	Well . So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . And it basically you go off , it downloads the movie , it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . And thi this is going to come . 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1796.56	Yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1874.61	three like this , actually , and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1894.0	Yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so . 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2214.27	Uh that's needed right now . And uh basically you can look to the standards of other 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2233.42	Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . 	IS1000b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
11.12	Yeah . Well uh I was expecting to get , yeah , though and I did did make it in time . But it just just 'cause all the leaves and things . Um the stra the trains weren't stopping at the stations . So they decided to put speed restrictions on 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
174.68	Yeah , yeah , yeah . It is . It it just has a couple of yeah , yeah . Um well yeah but if they will b but it doe does look like it does does that this is and things like that . So I was doing the is anyway . Um it's ju it's just that that's that's quite a quick way to just to get into how how works . Because I can just quickly generate quickly generate a web page and then just add and take yeah , add things to and take things away and don't see exactly what's going on at the time . So 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
202.7	Oh well just 'cause X_H_T_M_L_ has a nice you know , you got browsers there , so you can actually see you can actually see directly what's what's going on . 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_H_T_M_L, _]
234.06	Yeah , yeah . So all have to do is just change it change that sort of thing so it's uh yeah . Yeah . 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
365.64	Uh no . No . But uh I'll when and out of the output of the gest analyser does does do some of the processing already , which is what I'll m plan to use that as the basis for it . 'Cause that already that already picks up like target regions , things like that . So you get so so it knows whether you're looking at a part or whether you're looking at target area or what or whatever . Um so yes , as long as it got that in it somewhere . So it's just a matter of pulling that out and put that into the um into the G_D_F_ stuff . 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[G_D_F, _]
551.12	Yeah . Ah well ca I can easy I can easy get to mapl uh to Maplin I know where it is off I used to live there . So I know I know where I used to live here . I'm a geek . I know where I know where Maplin is . 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mapl, Maplin, Maplin]
595.88	Right , yeah . Well I'll make sure I make a I'll make sure of I got the f the phone number in my phone so I can call them . 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
754.92	I t I'd say you don't be . 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1279.3	Uh have a look . If you th anything prob any problems with it um think there's a Wiki page up for that f for that piece of uh for yeah , for that thing . So if if you just put just put whatever recommendations , bugs on that page and I'll work through them read 'em as and when I can . 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Wiki]
1560.03	Yeah , yeah . Um yeah , so I still gotta work on the gest analyzer and turn that into the t into a G_D_F_ outputter . Um and uh oh yeah , and I'll I can have a look at the model builder as well . Um 'cause one thing I'm thinking about is w we're looking at the the part building pa type stuff . Uh and it might worth seeing if we can add a little part builder thing into the um model builder . Um just just the ju I just gotta tidy tidy up some the code for generating the parts anyway , the J_C_T_ um parts from from S_V_G_s . Yeah . 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[S_V_G_s]	[pa, J_C_T]
1591.25	Yeah , yeah . But I'll wanna have a qui have a quick look and see see how easy it is to add this things to it . 'Cause um if if I can use it to generate um um the rotsym angle for example and the rotation symmetry stuff for it , which is what was causing the bugs uh before . Um so if I if I can use the model builder to automatically do that then that would sa that would save quite a bit of work and it'll d save a few bugs . So 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[qui]
1747.22	Yep . Yeah , so I think the G_D_F_ will keep me busy for a little while yet . So um yeah , well that's yeah , certainly keep me busy until this time next week when we can start suggesting things that might might need to look at for the next stage , I guess . 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[next, week]	[]	[G_D_F, _]
1893.95	Yeah , I mean I can remo 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1904.39	Yeah , I can remember when I start being a st when I was sta starting being a student . I mean ha we had the inductions were compulsory because um a lot of students were doing te were doing teaching . And you couldn't do the teaching unless you done the induction because you had to know about health and safety and fire safety before you could take a charge of yeah . 'Cause you were the responsible person in the in the class room . So 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[st, te]
2240.4	Right , okay . Well i i if if you want if you want the blinks mer merged into a fixation , it might worth making making a cr part of the requirement for the G_D_F_ stuff . So to remind me so to to just add that analysis to , yeah , to to it . So it's I mean it's easy enough to do , just che just checking the times th times of the events . 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[mer]	[]	[G_D_F, _, che]
2323.07	Right . Okay , okay . Um yeah , so might might worth us us having a look at that and just just seeing what dat is what data is already in the ASCII format and whether you want me to do any correction as part of the analysis . Um 'cause I've gotta do the analysis for the fixations on parts and things anyway . So yeah , I d I I I didn't think check for blinks during that . Isn't gonna be a shouldn't be a big problem . 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[dat]
2563.47	Yeah . Uh yeah . C well yeah , you told that earlier 'cause you could do a quick ana you could do a quick analysis on the G_D_F_ stuff without having to before you hit before you do the dialogue analysis type stuff . So you can get some some results anyway , can't you . Okay . Yeah . 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[G_D_F, _]
2708.33	Yeah , I suppose I can easy look through and start writing up some documentation on it . That'll gi that'll give us a starting point for us to sort to talk about it to look for what analysis we n actually need to do on it and things . Um yeah , easy . C yeah , create all the uh switches and whatever else you need to do . So um 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2726.12	Okay . Okay . Yeah . So we'll on once yeah . Well once I've had once I've had a bit of bit more look at this G_D_F_ stuff , then start looking through that . Start looking through that and make sure that works . 'Cause 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
2763.25	Yeah . Well uh I use it that useful for generating this G_D_F_ stuff , I can easily incorporate whatever functions it takes from into gest analyser when I'm do doing the G_D_F_ stuff . So 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, G_D_F, _]
2804.92	Yeah , yeah . I mean but what , yeah , say what what I'll what I'll plan to do with it then is take the is take to the software , find out what functions are useful for us in that , and then use those functions to generate the stuff that goes into the X_M_L_ file , the the G_F_ format . 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L, _, G_F, _]
2865.32	Yeah , fair enough . Well so so it's so long as it's X_M_L_ , N_X_T_ will handle it , won't it . 'Cause 	EN2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[N_X_T]	[X_M_L, _, _]
240.91	Okay so just could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report . 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
393.44	That 'cause that's that's fine . Just need to know so I can write it down . Okay um right I g I guess that's it , so we can now um 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
405.74	We can now have a little look at the 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
409.24	the Excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Excel]
503.04	Like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay . 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
560.01	Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro , so let me see , what are we I mean oh yes sorry , four point three . My maths is all out . 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
672.26	No can do . 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
730.58	Does that mean that one button has a special form or 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
899.3	So at this point we uh , let me see , discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
908.93	with these four points , with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , and the stuff we had around us I guess . Um , let me see uh 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
935.5	Yeah , yeah go for that first . I wasn't entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that , but y you go for it . 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1083.4	Oh yes sorry then , then I would say two or three . 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1111.03	I'd go with three or four , maybe three . 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1400.52	Right , okay . Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points , my four points , sorry , forgotten that . 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1574.94	Okay uh do you know what , actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , I think . Yeah . So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig . 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Craig]
2109.88	I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually , like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , um I don't know about anybody else . 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2175.1	Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , I thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah . 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2197.64	I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have like something written down , just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings , but 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2286.35	Ah well , maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money . 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2381.59	Just sit still I guess for a little while . 	ES2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
906.66	Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , you won't lose it . 	ES2012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1207.22	Okay well , I can do mine . 	ES2012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1211.7	Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um . 	ES2012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1364.25	Um and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . 	ES2012b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
353.48	Yeah I'll have a go . 	ES2004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
359.11	Alright , okay . Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I'll have to have to go for something a bit random . 	ES2004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
421.2	Yeah and uh I'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is . Um 	ES2004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
705.18	Use all the ones at the same time . 	ES2004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
486.81	uh to do in uh our design . So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . So maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
522.8	So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . Um uh let's see . Um yeah and 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[u, sa]
574.59	It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . So uh uh yeah . 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
593.56	And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sen, c]
619.8	Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
653.0	Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
686.09	And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . So um made a little uh picture of uh it . Um 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
703.62	See . 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
709.75	Um yeah . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . So um 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
735.38	D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
767.21	So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1400.79	Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh you 'cause uh Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . So 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nokia]
1419.3	maybe it's possible uh possibility . So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh Yeah . 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1615.37	Uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy . So um 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1722.36	See um yeah . Or we have to make a left uh For lefties and 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1958.76	Do you say this um 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2010.75	Uh to make this side um like mm 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2037.14	And to put uh the the buttons for um 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2055.08	Uh rem 	TS3003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
203.09	I'm sorry . Okay . Go on . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
587.23	So uh I bet a big company in uh Korea or Taiwan , like uh Samsung , can give us uh a big discount on the chips , so 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[Korea, Taiwan]	[Samsung]
645.44	Combine them . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
928.33	No , okay , but just just a wooden uh look . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
977.32	We have to aim at a mu at the main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
988.72	Uh , I'll I'll come to that in a second point . Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control . Like the Nokia uh the removable covers , uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[telephon, Nokia]
1024.19	Uh to come back to your question , I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard . Like uh 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[Milan, Paris]	[]
1067.8	Yeah , like something . You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak uh speech recognition and stuff . But , we have to keep the cost in uh in mind , but it 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1126.15	And third , I stick with it , the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1392.51	Yeah , and on two . That you can switch switch easy . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1517.23	Yeah . Pu push parents . That then then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in . Like two one three . And it's in . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pu]
1625.93	If I got kids , and I could choose between uh two remote controls . One uh w with parent control and one without , and I would would buy the one with . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
1779.95	And and you know w uh when you install another device , uh children can still go up to the T_V_ , p pop open uh the thing and and and g 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, p]
1791.93	go to a channel . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1907.12	To put Yeah , to put it in always . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2140.46	Yeah . Just leave the other numbers away . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2147.95	Okay . Go on . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2182.25	Management . Yeah , that's my function , to Okay . Go on . 	TS3007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
98.75	So , you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm]
239.15	Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one . And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ne, prevon, prevon]
263.52	The volume is is scrolling . On the side , this one . Yeah you just do it like this . And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm]
301.54	Well , we'll have this on the screen , on the display . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
334.44	Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
591.78	I would think yes , yeah . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
602.8	Yeah , so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
887.7	Yeah , it does have yeah . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
988.71	No , wait , a little bit under six . No , wait . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1222.26	Okay , let's yeah . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1307.06	Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1360.66	Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1381.17	But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1521.12	But it can be yellow as well . It can come in the same colour as the the case . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1751.76	To express them mm mm no . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1795.48	Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1920.8	You can make some animals . Oh , you don't like anim 	ES2006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
351.2	W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to you know 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
440.34	Okay , so let's try it , let's t 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
624.56	possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . So let's start with this . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
746.51	I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours . 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
768.39	Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels . 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nokia]
841.27	Okay , what uh there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
864.07	We can make it in fact . If if if the okay . 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
984.23	That they can use it in darkness , like . 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1089.76	To l to l lock it . 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1684.72	Well , we can make it smell like fruit . Yeah . 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1776.64	to make the like titanium panels 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1785.28	Well , okay w we'll see . 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1805.14	We'll see . We'll see . 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1814.5	We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for I dunno uh yeah um we'll look . 	IS1006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
45.96	I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting . Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
72.77	And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it . Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
84.39	and then uh we can close . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
88.06	Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh I'll show you the notes . I don't think it's very interesting . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
140.39	This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that . And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
150.26	Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
776.26	No . I totally agree . We we have to get get on , go through this . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
855.0	Yeah , but just do some We we 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
959.59	Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
981.96	Kick it out . We have to go to twelve and a half . The speaker costs far , by far the most . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[twelve, and, a, half]	[]	[]
993.98	We could make two different versions , one with and one without . But for this 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1074.14	Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there , because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1128.85	Well I I did single curve to Well you said s double curved , uh he , because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already . We can also make it flat . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1158.6	Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1232.91	And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1316.07	I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1328.2	I I'll talk to the managers . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1584.96	Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an I I like it . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1777.02	pay those uh papers uh that are expensive , I'm not going to uh 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1784.73	Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop . Because this is huge uh this v very very uh expensive paper . 	TS3009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
189.3	Guess . A human , yay . It's a very complex animal and um yeah . Characteristics of this this animal is dangerous . 	IS1006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
420.52	Oh like the phones , yeah , it could change colours , yeah . 	IS1006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
442.01	Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator whatever I dunno if it's 	IS1006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
462.74	Or if we should have a targeted re remote control . 	IS1006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
469.25	So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , yeah , size matters , yeah . 	IS1006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
554.96	Mm-hmm . I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user . So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , if you if you like . 	IS1006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
668.0	Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . 	IS1006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
708.21	Yeah . Uh uh we had that in in other countries . Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous . 	IS1006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
719.88	Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions , that becomes more complex , but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls . Yeah maybe it's a 	IS1006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
801.58	Okay . I'll think of that . 	IS1006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
628.23	We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . And of course we also have to make it look cool . 	ES2008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
705.83	it's very very quick to access the main features . Uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track , next track and play pause . They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time . Um then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . Um 	ES2008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod, L_C_D]
739.75	here's a another example . This is uh it's an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool . Um it's certainly got novelty value . Uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . Uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around . The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun . 	ES2008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
771.63	So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . I mean most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . So , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored . 	ES2008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
828.38	So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device . And that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often . 	ES2008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
877.28	There are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're I well we're I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . 	ES2008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1507.87	I think it could be difficult in practice , yeah . Also z yeah , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_ and people don't wanna do that . 	ES2008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, T_V]
1548.96	Like , to make it different fruits . 	ES2008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1921.84	And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . So in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons . 	ES2008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2050.49	Yeah , yeah , you can just and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button , but the volume control could double for that , for example . 	ES2008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
131.95	Okay so we can go to the slides . Yeah . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
148.65	Michael you can go ahead . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Michael]
165.46	You can pull it out first , maybe . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
232.1	And we we do have one more functionality . If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_ . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
295.52	And you can tele yeah , once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume . Yeah . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
548.55	Means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
692.99	Okay . Yeah yeah . Go ahead . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
719.43	So you can say fancy , 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
747.25	So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
766.22	Again I'll give seven . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
801.44	I'll give five . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
868.13	There I'll give it seven . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
938.53	I'll say five . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
941.37	I'll say five . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
995.81	Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Anyb]
1062.32	You'll have to reload . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1183.35	I'll still give it five . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1332.9	I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing . Yeah . To bring the cost 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1417.54	Yeah . So we we'll put some extras , if there is something . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1427.77	Okay . To reduce the cost , it's okay . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1592.75	instead of rubber , let it be plastic . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1896.62	Integrate . 	IS1004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
548.65	You can zap away . Yeah . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
704.53	Consider the m 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
772.94	Well we'll uh consider it uh . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
775.55	We'll think abo we'll think 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
810.55	Yeah , yeah , alright . Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think . We don't rule them out uh yet . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
859.19	We have that here . Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the F_ F_ five . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F, F, _]
871.12	Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do . So uh we have this . It's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something . It was originally in black and white but it became black and purple . But I think you can read it . Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . Uh well you can see uh 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
896.79	And I then can select I can select on the dings It goes to the next page . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
902.34	Well , you can read it , it's not too difficult . Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
949.91	Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps . Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
965.98	The key a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . uh and recognise the key . So well you understand . The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Morse]
1029.83	This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . It has uh very little buttons and But it it uh it's it's quite um Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . They're uh far enough apart and an anything . It's not very um 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1254.16	Yeah , uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages , with different links . Yeah . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1350.94	Uh you can draw it if you Yeah . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1390.66	We can put it on the on the back side . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1602.26	But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1728.83	Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . I dunno what uh you were talking about but 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1753.6	But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1865.39	Uh we uh we were busy with that . Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . So , we have the power button . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1882.7	While you have to agree , I can say it's like this and you must agree . Yeah . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1902.32	Well let's look at your uh design . Uh 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1990.96	No but now y W would we have to choose a 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[W]
2069.5	C c can you make you make We can use uh the drawing board now , I think . Uh it it doesn't work well but But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[board]
2130.3	As we we we we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ . So that's 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2159.26	They'd recognise it . Th that's the most That that's very easy . Yeah . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2253.5	But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . Uh that's that's too complicated . You can just put it somewhere They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2317.8	But it's easy to go If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2372.94	Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the Yeah . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2413.82	In the menu . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu . Yeah . Or the volume , yeah . 	TS3009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
209.67	These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . You have to use your imagination a little bit . And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through . 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
226.5	And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . Volume up and down . And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . It's that that simple . That just represents the infrared uh beam . 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
483.92	Some people might say it . Yeah . 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
606.76	Yeah . It's bright yellow . Bright yellow's hard to lose . But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . That was what we'd we'd mentioned . 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
622.98	Just just to use , to find it when it was lost . But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily . And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . That's gonna be a difficult shape to 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
641.75	I mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways . You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it . 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
721.19	stick it on the T_V_ . 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
759.66	I'd say so . Uh don't get many mo remote controls with 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
850.05	Be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely . 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
973.06	Charge about three hundred quid for it . 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1144.43	I'd say the integrated . 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1177.98	Yeah . I'd ignore that . 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1246.74	Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even , if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself . 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _, dis, T_V]
1275.5	Screen . Make it a bigger dial . Easier to use . Even easier to use then . 	ES2016d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
34.48	Okay uh Agnes , you can help me for the slide when okay . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Agnes]
40.93	Okay , welcome back . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
59.56	Okay , and uh we'll issue some information from uh all of you . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
68.56	And uh I will invite uh the Christine and the Ed and uh Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Christine, Ed, Agnes]
93.25	okay , to take the minutes of the meeting . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
168.89	So I will invite uh 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
177.19	So , I'll invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Christine]
454.54	Yeah , let me uh interrupt you uh 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
456.99	if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
486.95	Maybe you can uh add it in that . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
564.63	Uh let me go quickly , maybe if I can go back . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
575.87	So I can close this , not sure . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
618.44	So let me see where is this file . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
678.2	Okay , that maybe Eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price and uh what's uh how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be we sell in the market . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Eddie]
688.94	Then uh you can come back with your feedback . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
691.78	And I I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion . This remote control , okay , it can be for like universal , to use for any T_V_ . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
715.44	But let's try it , okay , with the different uh the designs , okay , the functional designs . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
734.48	Ed , so can you tell about 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ed]
1099.43	Well , what I can uh suggest to you , Christine , okay , uh if you need some uh the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition , 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Christine]
1112.92	I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_ , okay , because they're already in this uh speech recognition part , okay . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Intel]
1121.29	And uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them , some kind of a technical tie-up . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1127.44	Okay , and uh if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information , okay , and uh you can uh let me know , okay , so what kind of uh the details you require 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1140.75	okay , to add this feature 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1184.92	Yeah but but end of the day , you're the sales guy , so I will come back and sit on your head because uh you are going to give your sales projection , okay . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1236.16	So if you have any uh new ideas , okay , for uh your you can always come up and uh you can tell me if you need any uh s special , okay , coordination , okay , between any uh technical companies , which you can uh hide their technology backup , 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1278.92	Okay , I'll uh hand over to Agnes . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Agnes]
1575.09	So for anybody need uh any help , for time being , on this uh subjects , okay , so please come back to me , and uh Christine , maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies to help you for uh make a design uh slim , okay , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Christine]
1665.11	Okay , that will be great . And uh I'll send you the the minutes of meet 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1712.03	Okay , what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break , okay , then uh we can discuss furthermore , okay , with our areas , and uh then we will come back again in the in the next meeting . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1721.81	So thanks for coming and uh I'll send you minutes of meeting , and uh please put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1732.44	So let's go for lunch then . 	IS1008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
158.96	Well wha what I found um can you 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
199.5	the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . So now more more cool aspect , ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see . 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
272.9	So maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
349.44	may may could remind some kind of vegetable , some kind of 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
426.84	Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing . 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
456.29	to buy a a n a cooler remote control . 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
566.2	Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation , so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
802.28	Yeah but you can u 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1132.66	Yeah . Maybe you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can 	IS1004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
446.01	As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . 	ES2016c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
472.37	Okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and 	ES2016c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
497.53	Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . 	ES2016c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
511.24	And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . 	ES2016c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Manuel]
602.44	Yeah . So when you buy your remote you can buy 	ES2016c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
611.7	Personalise your remote . 	ES2016c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1560.32	The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it . 	ES2016c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1852.56	Nice . Could look like a fruit bowl . 	ES2016c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
68.15	Right let's see it . 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
577.7	Release your anger . 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
699.09	Just save it . 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
822.89	Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce . Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
840.76	so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control . 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
902.13	Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something . 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1089.12	I can imagine that us 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1153.17	Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1183.38	Yeah right right , and maybe we should use colours . 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1303.3	And you can use 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1348.29	To make it more trendy . 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1393.96	Yeah but then you can use a a front . 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1414.95	Yeah or a t Teletubby front . Yeah yeah yeah . I will investigate . 	TS3009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Teletubby]
212.86	Ah , wait , 's screw in . 	ES2008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
215.3	Push the screw . 	ES2008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
443.81	what people's preferences on that were , so I dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that . 	ES2008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1789.65	And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your T_V_ . 	ES2008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1802.35	Mm yeah . Maybe I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . But this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also , which isn't , I mean , really isn't that representative , especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group , so 	ES2008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1922.12	I mean , like I said before , fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it . 	ES2008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[fru]
2216.31	But if I open it and then save it , probably will be there . Oh wait , never mind you can't save it to the 	ES2008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
257.75	Yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen . Well , these would be the main buttons , h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to . But , well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up . We have the more advanced menu uh setting right here . We have the sub-menus and stu stuff . We made a top oh , or a front view . Just so like you wanna uh back view . As you can see , this uh there , there are uh two uh weird bumps in it . This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic . And uh this is for the artistic effect . Well , what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that . But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh with these two . And so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down . It won't uh roll around or stuff . But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old uh phones . Y you you may get the idea . So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be . The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers , like we discussed early on . Uh , you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel , but more fluidly and round . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y, s]
350.26	And uh , in these bumps you could actually uh put some electronics uh that would you can make a more thinner uh design , and that would actually look very nice , yeah . And uh , about the colour , what have 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
388.92	Yeah , f uh , as colours , do you do you have the picture in uh 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
393.11	Oh yeah . Now , well this is the idea about uh the bumps . Uh , you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior . It uh you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
542.41	Yeah . Yeah , maybe yeah , perhaps you're right . Uh , I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
740.9	I'll say it's about three . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
814.45	Yeah , but but the teletext button . Yeah , you can ch That's in a menu . So , it's w yeah , it it it it isn't entirely unclear , but So , I wouldn't give it a seven . I would give it a more a five or a six . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
892.42	Well , then uh then I'll go for four . Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false . Uh , 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
899.98	so I'll I'll go for four . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
938.17	Well , if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , uh then you'd uh recognise it as , whoa , that is strange . Yeah . Yeah , what is that . Uh , 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1003.26	No , it's it I I'll go for two . My vote's on two . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1260.42	Just go on . Then we'll see uh we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1326.5	Well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1381.0	Okay , well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1386.02	And that would solve the budget problem . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1501.26	Yeah , well let's assume it is . We we should assume it i that it is . But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . R if you uh promote a kinetic um I kinetic remote control , I mean , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1523.48	No , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic . You have standard old battery control uh remote con 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y, y, k]
1749.39	Try to learn from your mistake . And we will never do it again . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1993.89	Know what I mean . 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2131.36	Or text function . Just t t type text , and that that would be uh excellent . Mean 	TS3007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
779.7	Mm-hmm . Which will also feed into the marketing , because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users . So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit . 	IS1008a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
797.2	Um , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account . 	IS1008a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
33.63	So , uh now it's the Hi Sammy . It's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . Then , w we 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Rama]	[Hi, Sammy, Mark, Sammy, cr]
69.87	And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . And that's all . Okay . So first , let's uh 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
90.13	see the prototype . 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
471.03	Uh we'll see in the financial part if uh all gets into 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
498.66	Let's uh , yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
633.81	Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
666.76	Two . Let's say two , yeah . 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
684.8	Change colour of t 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
774.42	You c push here the the yeah . 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
829.01	Let me understand well , because I'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . Yeah , two 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
925.38	Let's imagine . 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
955.73	I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful . 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1077.19	Okay . Let's go for one . 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1218.99	Mm-hmm . Oh see , I I think that the the price is this one . 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1248.8	Oh , sorry . Again , I'm See it . 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1323.23	Stay longer . Okay . Oops . Okay , okay . Um 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1394.93	So think of what we can cut uh here . 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1519.24	Oh , we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want . Oh . Both its it's cool . 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1582.71	Mm , let's try . Okay . 	IS1006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
804.63	Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
812.35	Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting . Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
854.34	the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mike, Mike]
880.68	Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
900.05	um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
918.47	Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
964.78	Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
968.98	Yes . Um I shall draw this . If it uh works . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1044.23	This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen . And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus and that can 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1054.47	Um the video button should be uh an apart button , because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1070.2	This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus Well we we can add another button here , but 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Menu]
1097.42	No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Menu, Okay]
1175.63	And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . But 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1553.22	Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours , and they don't use uh wood . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1636.89	I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1712.59	Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so , so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more . Yeah . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1723.8	Red red , blue and green you give them or something , and then you can give them uh other ones . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1805.68	Yeah we should do that . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1820.81	Yeah , we can do that . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1834.85	Ah right . And take it to our rooms and uh 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1980.66	Uh I I'd say only the logo . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2034.56	Yeah , but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2232.58	Well we can uh erase an animal I guess . Uh the fourth one . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2409.56	We can better uh draw a design on this . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2437.66	Or we'll get the email . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2448.73	Well we'll wait a few seconds and then we'll get an email . 	TS3009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
328.55	You can you are . 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1204.27	But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number and then it go t because 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1238.36	But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1258.08	Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls so we can have more functions for T_V_ uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices . 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1325.45	Sorry . Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators . So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ramaro]
1366.59	So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1396.43	And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1415.38	some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1466.75	And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1473.97	Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things . 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s, s]
1556.56	Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , so we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Marketing, Expert]
1583.25	this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just yeah , so that we just use simple recog no but but 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1617.18	Yeah . No , even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1638.79	Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that , because we want to have uh millions and in bulk , so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like then we'll have something like this um 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1663.7	we'll have volume 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1666.5	and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen . 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1678.84	No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and yeah . 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1698.7	And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number , we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else because 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[B_B_C]
1757.82	Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this processor and 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1764.5	This really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s . 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1771.8	Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and like this key . 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_S_P]
1851.32	Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1863.75	They can make 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1872.64	Yeah we can have 	IS1006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
138.35	index finger of your other hand , or even I mean there's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
178.26	Um if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
327.73	Uh the menu select button . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
365.29	normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down , maybe with with less contrasts on it . Yeah , something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
469.2	to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
537.16	Here , stick it on . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
631.08	Well that on the iPod , for example , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
848.71	Yeah . I I would say that it's 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
894.34	Um I'll give it a one . Pretty hard to mess up . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
943.22	We might wanna keep it yellow . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1042.39	I'll I'll say two as well . Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first , but 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1071.25	The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1144.61	Um I'd say I'd give it uh a three , I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1184.65	I'm give it a three I guess . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1249.33	Yeah , I'll say two . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1408.25	No . Oh , we'll do we wa 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1476.6	Okay , let's have our buttons all be one colour . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1623.36	I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information , like what's a single-curved case , how many colours , what do colours count 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1654.76	Do you think we could 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1833.98	Take me to your leader . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1841.41	Wow , maybe I should market it to some remote control company now . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1933.91	Yeah , my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards . I learned a lot actually . I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2360.69	Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , I am located 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2395.24	Just if you like you'd have a remote for your remote , that'll . 	ES2008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
415.01	look and feel . 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
417.75	So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think . Uh just let me check . 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
451.82	Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
547.0	No , the colour is okay , that's fine . I mean it's but I would say there is more too much red . 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
584.68	Then uh let me 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
666.48	Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
692.19	Yeah but imagine you y 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
959.61	Fine to coarse . 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1313.7	No y i it did change , but just imagine we have 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1362.48	We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . Black then is a regular colour , so . 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1748.02	Tha that would that would make it . Yeah . 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Tha]
1913.21	Cute na 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1929.87	I would say flying saucer . 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2013.82	We should celebrate . 	IS1003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
49.3	I'll I'll fix it . Yeah , whatever . 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
542.91	how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . Uh , I've lined them up here . Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . I uh have found some interesting things . We do we do got a market . Um , three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
711.7	we could group them uh on one button 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
715.68	and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh yeah , how do you say , 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
732.64	we can spare at buttons over there . And um , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , not too uh 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[V_C_R, D_V_D]
916.07	Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . Not too much then , bu alright . 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
949.72	Yeah , I'll have a look . 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1128.16	Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever . 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1713.99	Yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . Why not . 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
1787.81	Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . I don't know . 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2027.12	We'll see . 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2067.64	Should we by the way draw um 	TS3008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
568.82	Okay . Come on my computer . Come on . 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
602.06	Okay now I think for this one I could Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it . Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
613.05	Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
651.14	I'll write down our scores up on the 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
740.29	So I myself would say a one or a two . 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
746.6	Okay , and p 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
952.8	Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it . 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
961.35	Shake it and the buttons fall off . 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1103.65	We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . Okay . Um 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1148.62	You could just press six enter , or one two enter . Yeah . 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1205.57	Could I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1256.66	So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ . 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_R, _]
1856.49	Yeah well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other , which was cool . Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and yeah , worked well . 	ES2015d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
870.62	So it will look like something like this . 	ES2007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
945.06	Yeah , so they can sit there and go like 	ES2007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1072.28	That does get annoying . 	ES2007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1391.28	Technologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . It should work . 	ES2007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1473.1	You could always insert , yeah . 	ES2007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1569.16	and um just go creative . 	ES2007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1580.62	And then you can market it . Never have to change a battery again . 	ES2007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1720.35	Maybe make it like fruity colours or something . 	ES2007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1811.43	Bright , but too not yeah . Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like 	ES2007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Wanna]
1863.78	I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . 	ES2007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1873.04	Like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one . And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um 	ES2007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mummy]
1903.83	Yeah . So so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something . 	ES2007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ki]
112.27	Wait . 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
137.06	sort of limitations we're operating with um uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . So . 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[I_E, _, U_I_D, _, I_D, _]
187.28	meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys . 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
701.97	Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . Um . Push button interface 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
748.56	So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
756.08	um or take out the back-up battery . Uh 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
824.53	in a way . Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
967.46	which I will allow Sarah to take over . 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sarah]
1077.54	Um yeah , I was just go on . 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1568.81	I wanna see the output files from these um , from the digital paper . I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap . I mean , just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wh, _]
1672.77	forty ish I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval , um . 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1838.93	Uh , yeah , I'd say so . 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1943.14	And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . Yeah what I'm gonna I'm gonna put um I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports . 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1991.75	Exactly uh I will save this into the 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2003.45	Yeah . Oh yeah . Yeah I know . Come on give me some information . Well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2095.85	W oh . The default track . I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball . That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version . 	ES2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[David, Burns]
342.22	Yeah . Programme it . 	IS1007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
408.5	Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . 	IS1007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
484.92	Yeah . So you can open uh three . 	IS1007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
504.37	can you show the next slide . 	IS1007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
507.0	So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . So so I found on a webs on the internet yeah . I spent a lot of time searching and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors so can you 	IS1007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
803.86	Uh it's gonna be small . Yeah . So it'll beep if you wanna find it you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . I dunno how bu 	IS1007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1074.96	Yeah , then we can conclude that . 	IS1007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1237.3	Yeah . Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . All the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change . 	IS1007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
230.01	Oh yeah , just progr programme above , I think . 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
418.61	Yeah . You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wai]
452.04	We'll discuss them in the usability lab . 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
957.64	We can make it a one . 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
992.31	One . One . Okay yeah , I'll I'll agree . 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1078.1	Uh , I will I will make it a three , because uh yeah . I I th 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1865.15	And then we can get a docking station . 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1890.5	But what what can we do 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1933.76	We'll go back uh tomorrow . 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	True	[tomorrow]	[]	[]
1976.27	That's the question . If we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2369.58	But then we could make a docking station . 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2719.64	We can do it here then . 	TS3008d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
349.58	Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem . Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . Um now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . 	ES2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
447.47	So my personal preferences . Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there . Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh . 	ES2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
482.44	I can plug you in . 	ES2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
806.75	The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not . 	ES2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[k]
95.28	No , no , you you can start . 	IS1005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
303.92	Yeah . The second one . Could you please show the presentation number three . 	IS1005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
331.7	Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second . 	IS1005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
354.59	Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . Um generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control . 	IS1005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
883.97	Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . 	IS1005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
165.19	So maybe you wanna make some notes of that . 	IS1009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
274.68	You wanna go Eileen and 	IS1009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Eileen]
288.1	And remember you have to press so it works . Mm-hmm . 	IS1009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
403.81	So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera . 	IS1009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
797.96	Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes . And see what we can come up with . 	IS1009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
84.65	Excuse me . Okay . 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
117.68	Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control . Um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
224.52	the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control . Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user's watching T_V_ . Um the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
279.59	And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . Um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um , and they used them very infrequently a as well . 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
364.46	We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control . In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control . Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . They want these features , they want these high technology features . Um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	True	[between, fifteen, and, twenty, five]	[]	[recognition]
396.47	Whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market . Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um I think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . That's my dic that's my presentation . Thank you . 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1464.6	Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need . 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1469.33	And then we can move on to the more advanced features . 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1605.4	To have some feedback . Yeah . 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1611.83	We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel . So we c you could quickly just through many channels . For the channels , perhaps . 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Petre]
1982.38	Uh um , you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2043.56	Very , yeah okay , very occasionally . But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but 	IS1005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
59.92	everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , yeah , double curved , um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different uh , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here . 	ES2007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
158.93	change that . So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it 	ES2007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
525.28	Yeah , have some have some . 	ES2007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
670.13	If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two . 	ES2007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
845.75	Now you guys have been a a great team . Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams , . 	ES2007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_R, _]
139.58	You're just gonna believe me , we'll go from there . Fair enough . 	ES2009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
160.92	Prove it yeah , okay . 	ES2009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
521.67	Probably classical , to totally geek it out , yeah I think . 	ES2009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
626.28	Yeah . Slide it in there . Yeah . 	ES2009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
640.88	I know . I know . Oh it should be interesting . Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back . 	ES2009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
651.08	Probably . Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide . 	ES2009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
659.99	Oh , now I can think of so many other ones . 	ES2009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
703.81	It must make all the difference . 	ES2009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
869.0	And negotiate that . Uh . 	ES2009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1001.24	Good idea . Start your minutes . Um 	ES2009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
270.03	I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
321.66	energy . Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls . 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
491.63	Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh maybe a kind of uh whole uh 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[bri]
504.21	a whole set of uh different uh remote controls . Maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
658.28	Maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t to the remote control . 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[t]
1153.88	Yes , you can put a logo on top of it . 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1221.63	Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on . 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1230.15	No , no , only the T_V_ channel with the with uh with uh four programmes . You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button . 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1389.63	Y yes , you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions . 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1432.8	Yes , you can put uh a little L_C_D_ display on it with uh with lots of information . But uh I haven't thought about it . 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1610.25	Yes , it was already made . Tha the remote control on the docking station . 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1656.19	I will rule the world with it . 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1772.51	We can have uh different uh uh fronts of the 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1894.17	Sports and gaming . Define . 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1920.29	Yes , w we can do that on the on the 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1931.37	We can make this as a style too . Uh , this is uh just a 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1942.56	No , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic . 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1991.11	in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry . Uh , they began with uh t typical uh leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all sort of colours , and w kind of fon of uh of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
2038.91	Then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new uh with new colours , new yes . 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2113.55	Yeah , or or when you use the buttons as black , it you can use two colours as well uh 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2308.31	I will make one in the next uh twenty minutes . 	TS3008c.C.words.xml	True	[the, next, uh, twenty, minutes]	[]	[]
81.6	will talk about some 	IS1007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
931.78	Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ . 	IS1007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1239.22	You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , instead of use the yeah . 	IS1007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1334.87	Yeah . Push push . 	IS1007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1389.42	Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . 	IS1007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1549.66	You will listen to a peep , special peep . 	IS1007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1884.5	Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary . 	IS1007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2027.76	Or we can switch on or switch off the the special , yeah . 	IS1007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2045.45	Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting . It's time to close this meeting . 	IS1007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
42.24	So we should probably prioritize our packages . 	EN2001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1167.5	But if you were doing a search over the whole corpus you'd have to load them all . 	EN2001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1644.2	Think so . 	EN2001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2460.68	Yeah , and then we'll maybe have to prioritize somebody into just integrating it . 	EN2001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4176.88	Yeah , we can ask Steve if um we can get space . 	EN2001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Steve]
4185.66	Yeah , uh we could do that . 	EN2001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
379.48	how we can make it work . 	IS1007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
461.76	We can think about an interface with uh well 	IS1007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
674.62	Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f 	IS1007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[dis]
751.96	Please , Norman , draw uh 	IS1007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Norman]
879.22	reflect about it and uh 	IS1007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
881.28	discuss it in the next meeting . 	IS1007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
98.74	I'll go first . 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
182.01	Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved . 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
214.07	Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . Um and just a little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro . 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
268.54	Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that . 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
337.73	Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
524.61	I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , it has a consistency of those stress balls . 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1055.87	It's true . We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1228.24	I would have to side with that , I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1334.5	Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery . 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1347.62	Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1419.94	Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes . 	ES2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
176.1	Mar 	IB4005.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1097.14	Yeah , you mean you can display some new journals or a new proceedings and Yeah . 	IB4005.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1474.12	But then you can create on more spared place in that big three piece room , no 	IB4005.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1542.53	But then you can move administration to the single room . The k Because she's only fifty per cent working and 	IB4005.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[k]
1554.44	Oh yeah . Yeah , and give that room to f some professor with a student or from for visitor with the visiting place or 	IB4005.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1818.76	But even like you can put mm Paola in administrate office like 	IB4005.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm, Paola, administrate, office]
89.28	Yeah but young people like that . So just do normal battery . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
127.52	But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it's it's flat , and the screen screen is just Well you just have to hold it like this then . So 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
160.16	Alright . Let's do it then . Yeah . we 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
254.38	Yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it . But you still But you then still need to have 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
266.81	Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . But you still um 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
338.15	stuff like that . Let let let me see what's more what's more popular . I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . I have to look on that . Let me see . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
385.4	Yeah . Let's drop the speech . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
403.73	Yeah . And then and then use um 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
465.01	That's basic . That that's what you need anyway . And then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
476.77	Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . Click again , it's okay . Then you only need one button to move back . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
498.64	Or or under each option , you set a you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
614.62	No but I I Because we have to use the special colour anyway . You forgot that . So let's go for the plastic . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
684.25	And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . I mean it's not that important , easy to use , but 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
730.39	Then then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
758.82	So let's see , we we drop the price by one and a half . But we still have thirteen left . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[one, and, a, half]	[]	[]
767.32	Thirteen . So still half . There goes the special co Well That would make it less appealing . So that's no option . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
863.71	Yeah true . Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
899.56	Yeah ma make it a special colour then . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
905.04	Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy . So 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
911.69	Yeah . Let's let's save it . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
917.76	Let's do it like this , I mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1035.93	Let's make it big . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1068.4	Um well they are in a Word document , which I will open now . Yeah . I don't know it's open yet . No . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Word]
1117.45	It it it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . So do you think 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1126.91	Yeah . You can you can ma Yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1246.01	Yeah we dropped it . You j you just push it in for Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then Yeah . I don't know . Yeah . Um it shows the relevant and most used functions . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1262.84	Yeah uh on the other uh on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1278.05	With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel . And then 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Yeah]
1444.09	The button has also colour . Yeah . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1488.41	Yeah . But then we would have to drop the screen . Oh red . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1531.28	Yeah . So I will say that is very true . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1543.67	Yeah . The remote control is easy to use . Well I would say Skill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Skill]
1569.13	Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1581.37	Yeah , uh I would go for the six too . So 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1630.55	Yeah . Logo . Okay I will go go for two . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Logo]
1650.54	uh turn around . Yeah . But um 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1702.36	Yeah just add them and then uh divide them . Yeah . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1709.7	Mm . I all made it po I I all made it I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it . I mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , uh Yes . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1846.36	Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess . Good example . Durable use . Easy to use . This is good . Fancy look and feel , that's good . Technology innovation was good , because of a marketing uh requirement . Re relevant most used function . And hides these functions . That was also a good thing . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2279.28	You can copy and paste the picture if you want . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2327.79	Type in your report . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2356.22	Just compare uh 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2462.42	Do like this . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2486.07	I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2680.45	And we move more to to working together as team , because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[the, next, half, hour]	[]	[]
2776.43	the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . Because it it it just works better . I mean uh uh I've made yeah , uh I've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . So it it's better a better device than uh 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2842.26	Well , it It's use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2895.76	Yes . Check your email . 	TS3006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
470.49	Okay . Give it a four . Yep . 	TS3010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
538.04	we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five . 	TS3010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
974.98	Um , so if uh I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery . 	TS3010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1747.39	Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions . So , it's good for the speed . 	TS3010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
124.99	You may need to 	ES2011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
135.74	But sometimes you have to do it it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight . 	ES2011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[press, F, _]
628.1	Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . 	ES2011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, T_V]
693.92	um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . 	ES2011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, T_V, I_R]
944.41	Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place since the T_V_ already has power . Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . 	ES2011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, I_R, _]
972.15	It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote . 	ES2011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
982.93	Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button . 	ES2011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1101.41	Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s . 	ES2011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1237.83	Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner . 	ES2011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1476.44	and menu maybe . 	ES2011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1496.22	But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch . 	ES2011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
18.43	Um , yeah , go for it mate . 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
62.12	Right . This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . So , the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , but uh personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . Um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[w]
256.21	Oh , um , you can clip them to your belt . 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
259.01	You should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well . 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
301.67	Yeah . It'll follow you if you 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
308.26	You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , I wouldn't worry too much . Should have good range . 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
428.23	Excellent , thank you very much . Dave , if you'd like to uh 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Dave]
432.76	have a dash . 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
656.53	Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now . Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and uh , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal . 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
680.46	Right . I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them . 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
721.12	Okay . Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls . 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
845.65	Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
953.03	Okay , well we're beginning to run out of time now , so , we've got a couple of ideas , we can we'll have to work fast , um , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind . Um 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1033.18	and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1100.31	I'd say we finish this one up , we get started , I'll get in , I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody . 	ES2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
265.18	Else my animal will be like king-size . I pretty much like a dolphin , because of its uh its freedom basically . Let's see . 	TS3012a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
288.32	Uh high-tech . Bit low-responsive though . Prefer pen and paper . 	TS3012a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
313.87	Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb . 	TS3012a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
319.01	I'll just finish up real soon , because I'm 	TS3012a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
338.27	Like the ocean , like swimming . Do that in my spare time , so that's basically an 	TS3012a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
346.95	Now we can forget this ever happened . 	TS3012a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
122.05	Yeah , do you think that's part of the name , yeah . I don't yeah , I have no way of knowing , yeah . 	EN2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
221.84	Emission line A_G_N_ . You can get A_G_N_ without emission lines . 	EN2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[A_G_N, _]
428.14	Yeah . So let's do that . Extend . 	EN2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
579.42	Uh I can agree with taking that out . 	EN2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
767.18	And should come out . 	EN2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
826.89	Uh line emitting gas I don't like , yeah . 	EN2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]

2551.08	Well we've both marked it . So let's leave it there . 	EN2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2778.49	Yeah . Okay . So you can have that . 	EN2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2783.17	Right . At the other one we stopped after four metre . So maybe we should do that there as well . 	EN2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2826.66	Narrow line region emission . Uh do you th I think that goes out . Yeah , we don't 	EN2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
401.39	Okay . So you you should first train the P_L_S_A_ stuff , then you initialise this link uh spreading thing , and then you iterate over okay . And it converge and so you have the boost uh initial P_L_S_A_ and P_L_S_A_ plus the link thing then . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
559.09	But but maybe you you could have some some other labelli li or the task like if if you imagine you have some labelling on of of the web pages like like like for example you you look at at at at at a set of pages , and you have the m the directory entries of these pages , so so f like Yahoo or entries , so you have categories and and entries , so for example you have I dunno , cars , S_U_V_ , etcetera . So what you would like would be that two pages on in the same um category should be closer than than two pages being spread across different categories . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[S_U_V]	[labelli, li, Yahoo, _]
721.86	So so so w what what you would have have basically would be to have a directory which give you labels for some part of the documents . Okay , so this is a directory and this is some some some some web page , okay . So the labelled one , okay . And you have some page which are unlabelled but you have links between those two . So what what you would do is that you would try and P_L_S_A_ and and uh and use a model over that . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
755.03	Then then you would like to for example what f what could be very simple would be just to then to match each pages like that . So let's say you have you have a a page which is labelled , and you say okay , the the label page two should get should be the one w which it is the most similar to , or any kind of classification rules you can imagine . And so and so you say okay , what what's if I from from this page which have the similar so so the the criterion would be to compare those two distribution , okay , and then and then you would like to assign to this document too where you don't know the labels the same one as this one . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
811.47	Then you can evaluate how wrong you are or cu how close you are from the real assignment , the right directory category . In this way I think it's fair if you kn if you know only if you know only that and that and what you would like to discover is this . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
834.02	This is a r like a real task . Like like if if if this directory uh uh company would like to extend this directory to new pages without the hassle of having human labelling . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
863.0	So you you would train it you this is this is t t all all those links are known . The links between some labelled document and unlabelled document . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
882.23	I d I think you can do it as a two step process . First you you train uh well maybe s it wou could be better if if if you take it into account . But but maybe you can you can do just a two step process , first one you have this uh unsupervised task over both P_L_ and P_U_ , and then you from these unsupervised starts you can know which document of P_L_ is close from the document of P_U_ or the reverse . And you can infer some label to a document of P_L_ . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[P_L, P_U, P_U, P_L]
992.39	Yeah . But but here you can you you say given a random page of P_U_ , which of those two model is more likely to to to to to say for example that thi the page of P_L_ which is the most similar , so you so so from this so you take any distribution comparison things , so so Hoffmann in his paper was doing just cosine similarity , but you can do anything . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[P_U, P_L, Hoffmann]
1068.18	This is what what this is very related to what Frank did with the with the keyword uh image annotation . So you would have a set of keywords , the set of image label with keywords , and he has a set of unlabelled image with some , and it would check whether the the label he assigns , so in this case annotation word h are correct . And I think it's fair uh it's fair uh setup . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Frank, keyword]
1226.98	Yeah , you can have tree setups , uh yeah . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1317.9	Yeah . But the point is that the Z_ the the the aspect like the Z_ are are are come unsupervisely . It's it's more like if you were giving the people you you said to them okay , uh divide me this bunch of documents into five topics , and you don't give them the topics a priori , you know . So the two person could come up with very different one is very interesting i in 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Z, _, Z]
1443.34	But eve ev even someone would would provide very different labels , like like someone would say it's a page in English , someone would say it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a web page uh wh which has very few uh information in it or anything . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[English]
1505.49	I would say an an and this is oh it it should be evaluated , meaning that like for example uh the the example about marbles is that the point what you can learn from all these sets made by people is that is that those two those two marble would be consider as more likely to be in the same sets , because they they share some common properties which are not seen as the same for every one . But they share some common properties that people will notice . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1536.45	And if you look at the two the d all possible pairs of marble , you would have some mu much more agreement between people than than if you look at the predefined sets people would would just cut at some precise uh point . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1965.48	Yeah . Yeah . But also it depends on that could be a good effect . Because if you if you can be if you can if you are uh highly reliable about one page , but all the page linking to it are actually about very different topics , so you could say maybe I was wrong from deciding only due to the text that this page was about this aspect distribution , because because all the other pages are voting in different direction . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2084.16	But I think for any kind of way you have to select those alpha you you have to look at the effect on on the re on the t evaluation task . And then maybe you can find some patterns that are then then once you have the once you have the task , you could look at at which pages are completely missed by one model , which others are are successful with one model , and and you can maybe infer some some rules afterwards . But if you have no task , you can uh blindly select s good alphas . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
2118.61	Like like if if you look at uh if you look at your task and you see that , I dunno uh , the the long pages for example have good P_L_S_A_ model without fusing links , so then you can infer some heuristics like okay , the alpha should be proportional to the lengths or anything like that , or to the number of image in the pages , or anything . But you should have some some task where you can individually look at the performance on every on every page . And and and and at as a second step you could infer some kind of rule about how to select alphas with respect to the task . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2262.77	Yeah . Well you can categorise them because they are th it's there's a structure on the on the web page . So you you can select only the links which are within the article or within the categories or it's it's it's well-structured , it's it's uh easy to manipulate and 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2283.71	Yeah . You can even isolate the directory from the categories of Wikipedia . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Wikipedia]
2368.75	Yeah . But you can you can think also at at other uh task like that . Like for example you can take proceedings and assume the categories are the keywords of the of the d of the documents , and then if you have the archive of a journal , you can you can use the l the links between uh the citation links . So if you want to have a bigger stuff so Wikipedia would be kind of very small with lots of Engli in links , and then if you take a journal you will have less links and and more documents . And then you would be likely to say that P_L_S_A_ might be better over that , because you don't have enough links . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[Engli]	[Wikipedia]
2409.12	So you you you can find examples which are not the web I think it's good to work in closed set . Wikipedia is kind of closed set , ma even if there's lots of outside links , but there's lots of inside links . You have to think at at at at at at at database where there's lot of in links . Wikipedia might be one , citation , for example if if you take the NIPS arch archive , which is available . NIPS author always other NIPS author , which are often themselves , etcetera . Well , it's reported , I I won't say . So but but but but yeah , I think th th this kind of setup maybe web pages it's hard to find , sets of web pages which have good links stuff if you start from one page or something . 	IN1005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Wikipedia, ma, Wikipedia, NIPS, NIPS, NIPS]
93.04	So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff , then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
111.2	And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
175.76	Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
190.42	And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[interf]
205.97	And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
220.8	So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[white, board]
258.76	If you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh I'll let you uh comment . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
370.93	Okay . Olivier , do you want to 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
377.85	Okay I go , but next time you'll do something I'm sure . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
416.15	I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact I would say . Okay so I hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
435.65	Let's move on . So 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
475.01	We have to discuss that point . On yeah you you can suggest points like this . So what what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
604.68	To , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall . Water-proof as well . Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others can't . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
655.67	But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
664.87	Yeah . Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
692.87	Maybe we can have uh 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
761.23	Which is you . Okay so try to find that for next meeting . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
788.59	So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[User, Interf, Interface, Designer]
805.28	And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Market, Expert]
821.24	So . And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
858.05	Anyway you will receive some messages . 	IS1001a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
120.98	As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , um become acquainted with each other , um have a little training on tools , uh create a plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . 	ES2013a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
139.05	Okay . The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . The originality um is gonna take all of us . Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you , Sarah . Um and we'll get on with it . Okay , so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design . 	ES2013a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Steph, Sarah]
191.76	And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around . 	ES2013a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
431.28	Um cats are sometimes very independent . My parents had cats . Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . 	ES2013a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
560.0	To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking . 	ES2013a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
587.38	To be fifty , be four million . You'd have to sell four million . 	ES2013a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
205.46	I've save it on my computer , my presentation . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
249.07	Wait . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
334.64	Open it . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
402.94	Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
482.16	And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult . And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
521.72	Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
539.41	We can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . That's I think it's easier . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
555.47	And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[a, week]	[]	[]
596.28	Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting . Just 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
636.31	Then this is an option . Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
668.62	And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
676.98	And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . But Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nokia]
693.11	So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . And also different things . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
733.25	Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . If it won't works then we'll get something else . Then we uh won't g uh go further with it . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1571.65	'Kay , we'll just have to do that . Okay . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
1684.61	To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down . 	TS3010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
668.61	He used to have before he lost all the data . But he will have it again . 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1014.18	You may almost want to dis uh um i b uh uh uh yeah , uh b use the white-board , I mean uh and uh that's why we have it here , right , so that 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[dis]
1369.1	To get the uh 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1389.05	When you comp uh w what you com when you compress the effectively they'll want the signal which we are modelling . And uh so then you get the fitting to compress signal . Essentially if you were in spectral domain you would compress the power spectrum . Here you compress the the th this th this i the what ful yeah of D_C_T_ of of the signal , right . And so the w then you have uh predictor is fitting actually this compress signal . But you know how much c it was compressed . So you can always expand it back so that you get the c that you get a fit to the to the original thing , except that if it is different . Because uh it ha th basically this OPAL modeling has a different properties . And uh it's 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_C_T]
1436.32	So we can tell you a little bit more about it . This is an uh sort of old technique which uh it 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1532.66	SAPA . And then yeah this is a this they are two papers in uh one is in SAPA , one is in uh U_ Interspeech . uh in a c Cheju . And one was in the A_S_R_U_ . It was from Virgin Islands . SAPA was a s I I tell you what it stands for , statistic and ad and something ad and uh perceptual approaches . I was on f I was on a f w s organising committee . I should know .

That was uh 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Cheju, Virgin, Islands]	[SAPA, _, c, A_S_R_U, _, SAPA, f, w, s]
1619.96	Yeah , uh but um so whatever you g whatever you get hands on from Les Atlas uh for over past five years uh regardi this two years ago , last year on one of the ICASSPs he had like five papers , right . Or various aspects of this because uh he's eager to 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[over, past, five, years, this, two, years, ago, last, year]	[]	[Les, Atlas]
1671.06	To fill in , yeah , with all kinds of parameters . 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1924.27	And i and this and this is all on the record . So if we uh if uh if we you can hold him to his word . 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1936.39	J ju you rewind . Browse through the meeting . Okay . 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[J, ju]
1981.27	So we'll see . 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1999.98	No . No . I've it's uh i it I should have at least four . Because this is a p like uh graduates . But I have one , alright . Guaranteed . I have one guaranteed that I don't know if anybody else is uh 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2154.27	Oh we'll see . 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2170.93	Right , it's uh ju it's a little bit up to you . You have to p you have to back this uh uh ha h specially Petr . Because just to make sure that and yeah . Yeah . 	IN1007.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ju, Petr]
1.45	Wait for the marketing director actually , so . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
32.4	Uh no problem . We're about to start , so have a seat . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
45.43	I'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting . Okay , that was just to get to know each other , have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project , so 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
53.9	I put the minutes on the I made on the on the p the the project share , so if you wanna review them , they're there . I will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there . Anyways , um today three presentations , from every one of you . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
89.78	Take it . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
96.31	Anyway , let's see what you have . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
200.6	Okay , just talk ahead . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
245.41	Okay , we can we can hide those under a menu or something , okay . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
295.65	We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel . Okay . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
303.74	That sounds too It's possible , but uh I think it's expensive , but do continue . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
379.6	No problem , it's it's okay , that's Yeah , go ahead . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
467.29	Okay , so have it more make it more durable actually . Okay . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
494.8	Wow . The s Yeah . Make it make them bigger . Even more durable uh . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
540.17	I must say that it 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
545.53	That was it . Okay , that was good . So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing , so The other aspects , we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
665.41	You mean integrate them all into the circuit board . Okay . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[board]
815.16	Yeah . see how far we can go with it anyway , so And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently black and yellow , but 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
851.1	on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . Or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
858.23	And sell the covers separately , for example . That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone . So you don't have to I think you don't have to make entire remote controls . We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately . So that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . So just 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
901.58	I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . It costs a lot , I think . What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview , but y I'm not sure if it's even possible . For example , a little T_V_ guide . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1050.57	Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . Let's see . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
1097.59	you could For example , if your buttons are faded , after I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . Uh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make . So it's a good and a bad idea . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1119.95	Yeah , I know , it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example , okay . Yeah , that's what I something I have to look into . Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , I'm not sure which which is easier , so 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1132.53	Um anyway , yeah , this is what we're gonna do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let's see what we let's see we 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1164.62	Yeah , I think user interface is fairly obvious . I mean it should be very intuitive , s Yeah , it should speak for itself . Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_ , it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , and I'm total T_V_ new , anyway . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[last, week]	[]	[T_V]
1181.21	So I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things . Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1327.48	Yeah , that's true . I think so uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , I think it's possible , just the way how to . Yeah , then then you could do everything I suppose , because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it's okay . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1400.52	So you have the transmitter here for example . Let's see that you what would be handy . I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own . Let's see one , two God damn it . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[God]
1419.64	Another one here . Let's see what I think this should these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1428.79	Think it's like this . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1431.47	Withi within the Yeah , just take it . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Withi]
1441.06	Do you take triangles or 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1443.92	Um I think it should be I think it Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . Yeah . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1485.83	Yeah , I thought about for deaf people for example , so . We could do that . Uh let's see . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1526.91	From top to bottom . Yeah , that's true , you should I think the bu the power button should be on top , 'cause it's the first thing you do , turn it on . So power button on top . Um 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1544.09	Mute . Turn the sound off . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1569.27	Take this out and here see 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1593.85	Here , okay . Okay , should we chan okay , this two , channel 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1666.62	I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1684.92	Well , we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal or So you could put that on a T_V_ for example . It could be very flat , could be very small . It's a very small Yeah , I'm drawing it big now , but So you can put your remote on flat for example . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1763.65	I think it would be good actually . I like the beep part anyway . So um let's go through the 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1792.01	Maybe yeah , or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . We are going for twenty five Euros sales price , but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , uh we just have to see what it looks like . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
1879.79	Um other side . Yeah , let's increase it a little because 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1888.35	Yeah , draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , so the more less important 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1899.24	Just play a little with this , put l shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1904.96	Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1985.69	Uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2054.17	Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , because if apparently it's what people want , it's supposed to be a luxurious remote , maybe it's not even that expensive . Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2068.44	Me too . I mean we all do . Right . I think it's something we should put into consideration . Apparently it's what people want , so . We should see if what it costs , if it's possible . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2084.33	Yeah , we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me . Even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it , it looks still looks boring , so . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2135.21	So let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . Let's take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap uh came up with . I'll just make it a little bigger now . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
2156.18	We could let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , people want an L_C_D_ screen . So then we should probably put it here . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2204.07	Uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it , ri I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2213.31	You would prefer it n Okay . So we have three people saying it should be on top . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2218.87	Okay , but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . Anyways . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2279.95	For up and down , ma make it a circle on it , because it 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
2303.4	No , let's see . For example just 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2334.41	Mm let's see . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
2357.8	I think this would this would look cool . You could have it for example 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2364.19	small buttons here for some extra functions , so if your basic function's here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down , 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2386.78	Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . But let's cut the meeting for now yes . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2404.47	Yeah , let's think of a name , okay . 	TS3012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
600.02	Um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . Um to save you getting off your backside . Um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . On the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set . Um giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . And most of these functions are not going to be used , it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used . Um 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
681.19	V_C_R_ presumably into that then there's a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , so forth . Um . 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[V_C_R]
718.33	something that is more programmable , that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want . 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
730.62	Um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , and have a disp you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ebenezer]
1201.96	I mean I w I would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white . Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down . 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Si]
1218.14	Um I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first , you know , oh colour's out , we'll have to replace it won't we . It does nothing extra . 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w, w, w, w]
1352.52	Mm . I th the thing I like about the uh the uh joystick is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for for T_ T_ for T_V_ remote alone , you could put 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[joystick, T, T_V]
1369.84	um I mean there are like I say the the the main things people do with a T_V_ remote control is the volume and the channel . You can pack all that onto was onto a single control . Um . 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1527.62	Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1763.56	Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons , the y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button . I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay . 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y, joystick, mo]
2026.45	You know I think I mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that , save us the bother , then that's you know vast amounts of sales . Quite quickly . 	ES2003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
148.87	Ah cool . Okay . So that's my name , . Uh we're going to make uh a remote control , you already know that . Just have a look , are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting . You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
266.1	so you can read . You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard and um and say why it's your favourite animal . So and you have this is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
286.48	So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
304.79	and a different colour can use here no I just take the pink . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
311.25	You take oh there's no pink , okay , oh just purple , okay . No blue . And uh line width ten . Okay uh just take what I'm going to draw is an elephant . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
327.7	Just draw slowly , because otherwise it won't work . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
338.18	nice elephant , you can see . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
387.73	for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
492.71	Uh do you have to write down why uh that doesn't matter , just it's to get used to the whiteboard , but it's okay . Just make a new blank new blank page . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
568.78	Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , so that no , to the yeah . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
599.52	Use your fantasy . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
758.13	So can someone make a 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
761.41	a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . Uh so we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything , so just have a look how it we think about remote controls . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
847.11	So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1016.63	You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1027.87	Oh maybe that's a good idea , just to put it on your television and just s recharge , you never have to use any batteries . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1273.88	Just if what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1298.49	So see you in thirty minutes . 	TS3004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
74.59	Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . Um . Alright we're moving on to conceptual design . 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
88.02	Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . Um , under marketing we targeted our audience , and 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
124.67	So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
646.96	But but imagine someone with s 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
651.44	But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
718.68	I mean with that many options , you'd uh I'd think that the screen would be better , because you could have that menu option , sort of 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
771.8	So it would have all these different options of changing 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
834.74	So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean okay . 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
916.52	Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah . 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1146.86	So what if what this is I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . Is that kind of I 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours . Um 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1227.15	Okay . Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy . 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1234.04	That see I was thinking this s sorry I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing . And like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there . Um but 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1260.16	It's almost like your thumb is farther up , so if if you could squish it lower then 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1555.07	thinking of like syntactic case and thi um let's see . 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[thi]
1589.83	So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach . 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm]
1595.76	See you soon . 	ES2011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
195.49	Well we will try . 	TS3010a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
852.74	And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them . 	TS3010a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
840.76	Um so so can I just ask w w now you just uh aligned d uh sorry , you circle the word in the in the outline which didn't 	EN2006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w, w]
2434.24	Um so uh just about changing rules , I mean in a sense you also want to make sure that the annotation that that they the agreements that you arrive on today , that they're consistent with what you did before . Right , so uh I mean this really only displays uh th those cases where you disagreed . But if you sorta like change a rule now on the fly , then that might be then that might b uh create inconsistencies with the 	EN2006a.D.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
200.05	Okay , I'll draw . I'll draw one . 	ES2011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
203.5	Make sure my things here . 	ES2011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
658.36	I was thinking that too . I think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button , I've always wanted that , so like you can push a button on your T_V_ Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control . 	ES2011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
786.02	Or like or like a light thing . You know . I dunno . Yeah . Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah . That would be really I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop . Yeah . Uh . 	ES2011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
1075.1	What effect should the thing ha should it have , okay . Alright . And working design . Okay . 	ES2011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
117.09	Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . 	TS3010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
124.04	Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh 	TS3010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
132.84	uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . 	TS3010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
139.4	Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . 	TS3010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
157.38	Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . 	TS3010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
1249.27	And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . Like uh 	TS3010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1952.44	turn it inside . 	TS3010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
127.71	People , welcome back . 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
201.02	Okay . Um we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Forty minutes in total for this . So um I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made . Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation . 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ruud]
448.1	You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover . 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
625.96	Yeah . And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control . Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery , s because um 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[glatt]
880.64	I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny . I mean solar is of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel . Um hand dynamo 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1109.28	And click it to muten the device . 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1492.75	But but do we want the curved uh uh design , or 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1563.5	Well , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably you're probably right . But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue . 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1665.84	Yeah . Okay , I I agree . I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ruud]
1674.87	um add or or maybe thoughts or 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1742.53	Keep it in mind . And um the buttons , well we talked about it now . The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design . And for you , the product evaluation . Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that . Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[U_I_D]	[I_D, _, _]
1786.74	Yeah , it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready . 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2023.84	I think rubber is nice . Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2070.65	Yeah . You could place a um uh this this would be the button . 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2076.77	The scroll-wheel , I mean . And you could place 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2137.27	Yeah . Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel . But the front , 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2253.22	Okay . With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . The chip is is not really 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2275.89	Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um 	TS3011c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
93.56	So we uh we will wait for Anna , a few minutes . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Anna]
122.88	I think it should work like this . So I will try to get my presentation running . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
212.93	Yes and you can put can clip it uh on your 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
240.34	So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here . Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . See what our roles are in this project . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
267.9	to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
277.53	we will also try to uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
301.7	Uh then we will uh discuss uh , well , how it should be and uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
309.62	wh what uh what our new product should look lite like . And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
357.68	But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
401.41	then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . And the same holds for the uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
426.45	Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
445.88	And um well it should work uh I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
478.02	Yes well we will then find out ho how it works . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
492.0	So , we'll come to that later . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
495.3	So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
504.97	I would suggest uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
508.8	Well , yes , um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . I I'm not really sure how this works , but 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
553.6	Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna , maybe you can start . Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Anna]
594.54	So draw it . We will try to guess what it is . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
790.23	Can you can meet them in Africa , I think . Yes . Very good . So 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Africa]
931.62	some contribution to our project . So . Let's see . Which animal has not been drawn yet . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1029.29	W Well , this uh this tool seemed to work . Let's continue to uh to the real stuff . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1059.08	designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh People uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mael]
1076.13	Yes . Okay . Um more interesting for our company of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things . Uh we will try to uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
1165.08	And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1182.06	Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1198.92	Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1285.38	to specify in this first phase of of the project . So the browse function , as you m mentioned . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1341.49	Uh w y you two should should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
1379.07	Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm, k, Euro]
1389.54	w we can leave that out , I think . So twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
1435.35	Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting . 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1457.14	well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . So 	IS1000a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
0.02	'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is , so in that sense so it does kind of make sense , yeah . 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
918.56	Yeah okay . Let me just get this going first . 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
957.91	Okay um I guess the same thing again , I started with something very basic . So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process , um and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are . 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
973.68	Um the components are exactly the same . Um I think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface . The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . Um like you said time to market was a problem , um and how many components are physically in there in cost . 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
992.23	And the power is basically a factor of that . Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1017.93	So um you know it's just a matter of working out space . So I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size . These are the three things that um will have an impact on you . So just go through it in the components . Um these are the options that are available to you , um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1070.14	No um they're well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later . Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks . It can actually be flat or it can be curved , um and then the different types of materials that you can use , um I don't think you can use them in a combination , 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1090.69	um but um I could check back for you , but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination . 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1119.2	I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . You know as opposed to two . Um and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips . The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1249.78	Um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so . Um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions . Um 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1411.56	um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . So you could trigger that to a light , like I said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sorta]
1844.5	You could put a game on it . When the T_V_ dies you can play with the remote control . 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
2126.41	That's a very unnatural motion to yeah . Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . Um it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , but not for channels right . If you have a Telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , you've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to . Um and I don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the I dunno . 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Telewest]
2322.56	Feel like fruit . Fruits kids . 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2365.27	Okay , can I just swipe your power cable , I don't think it matters . 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2399.93	I'm gonna take the microphones , 'cause it's too lazy t take them off again . 	ES2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
918.43	But so yes dependable , and have a good medium range size . 	ES2012a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1046.26	Well you could come up with like novelty ones , like they've done with the the mobile phones , you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like oh I want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money . 	ES2012a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
43.6	let's get started . Oh , no , let's have the prototype presentation . 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
269.75	I'll wait . 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
326.28	Oh , and ma it's a prototype , right . 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
346.24	Imagine , since we obviously don't have that . 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
421.16	Yeah . I'd go for a three or four on that one , so okay , let's go for a three point five . 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
467.43	It does . Very good . Alright , let's go back to this 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
519.64	Number of components you plan to use . Do I just put quantity being one battery , or 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
583.96	Okay , so we can just go um . 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
655.4	We can go to 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
764.5	I think ya' did . Did you work well together in there , and 'kay . 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
878.78	Just the Mac font bothers me even . But I do like iPods , go figure . 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mac]
887.7	Mm-hmm . Colours . Exactly . I mean how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates . 	ES2010d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nokia]
93.12	So that we can move onto the second uh phase . But first this phase . Um first an announcement . There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . So 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
140.36	Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you . Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me . 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
574.62	Yeah you can take your time . We've got uh plenty of time , so 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1126.66	Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert . Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert]
1168.78	let's have a discussion on the control functions . 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1178.98	Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1255.51	I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned . Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1393.12	uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1489.48	make that um 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1493.46	another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles . 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1535.32	So to keep it simple . 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1562.0	But do you need 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1566.54	But do you need the buttons for one to zero . Maybe c we can 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1577.11	Maybe we can use uh 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1593.04	There are other ways too . Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sony]
1640.74	the numbers yeah . Yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it . But I think there won't be very much buttons . Or there don't have to be a lot . 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1681.93	You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1701.66	To operate only the T_V_ yeah . 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1762.38	Mm . No . Do you think the docking station will 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1824.57	So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something . 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1929.41	I think that should be possible as well . Um let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1988.8	Uh let's um specify the target group . Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2020.51	target the real elderly people . 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2105.96	Uh okay . I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , User Interface Designer the user interface concept , and the trend-watching . 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer, User, Interface, Designer]
2124.58	So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , uh requirements , and the trends which are uh going on . And uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach . 	TS3003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
62.43	To discuss uh , yeah , the project Alexandre and uh Jean-Marc uh proposed 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Alexandre, Jean, Marc]
69.27	a about uh capturing uh audio , video and slide uh in a synchronized way . And so we will start with uh an introduction . Uh I think Olivier prepared some slides about uh reviewing uh 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Olivier]
120.44	Maybe you can access through the network . 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
146.35	So um w yeah , we had like five slides y uh presenting different systems . And mayb maybe you we can do that at the white-board . I it's a bit stupid . But uh y you know . I think you remember well the different uh parts . And uh I'm sure uh we can do that at the white-board . Yeah , it would be great to use the white-board . 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
448.9	And uh I'd like to add that this c I think it's quite ambitious project because it's with uh the CERN . And they w they uh already worked on uh a European project called InDiCo , where they they have uh release , deliver , a full um kind of conference uh uh software . And uh to to manage uh all the the conference aspects uh uh we have in a conference automatically . And uh I know that at Fribourg they installed uh already in in a in a big uh amphitheatre for students . And I guess it's currently working . 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[]	[Fribourg]	[CERN, InDiCo]
728.02	To c to capture 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2403.3	Ye well , we would look both at . Because we are also both uh quite busy with other projects of course . Uh e H_F_E_S_ database uh with J_ Ferret uh 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[e, H_F_E_S, _, database, J, _, Ferret]
2541.38	So yeah . Let's see . From fro for checking Darren's code , et cetera we can expect until uh 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Darren]
2587.37	So we can say we try to to make something for April . 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[April]	[]	[]
2676.8	And we can ask help uh 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3052.9	To work on that . 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3282.27	Well I would like to to to work on p kind of part time uh uh w o yeah . Yeah . 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3291.64	And one full day a week . And I would okay , maybe you won't like my answer but I would say that um we ch we we start but we h we really have to start on working wi uh reading all the code from Darren . Then this um card with the code , I_V_C_ card , and to to try this . Then we try a little bit direct show to see um uh to to have an idea of how how long uh that could be . And then at the moment we can say okay we need someone to help us . 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[one, full, day, a, week]	[]	[wi, Darren, I_V_C, _]
3337.03	Well , w uh let's do that . Let's do that . Okay . Fo 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3546.17	So you could say okay , let's for Christmas let's try this without the all the synchronization . Uh with direct show issue . Okay oh yeah , you are you cannot or o l uh by doing one one day a week , mm you know just I think the cards . 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[Christmas, one, day, a, week]	[]	[]
3589.04	So I try my best until January . And um and I try to do what Jean-Marc uh described to give you a first feedback on the different cards . Uh and uh and from there it would m yeah . 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[January]	[]	[Jean, Marc]
3656.36	I would say uh let's let's yeah , let's try to have one uh students uh to help us on that . I don't know . That is very well , we have to choose whether the students it's too it'd be stupid . But uh uh the the student should have knowledge about M_F_C_ with oh okay . Yeah . Mm-hmm . 	IN1014.C.words.xml	True	[]	[M_F_C]	[_]
198.23	You know you could you could do it yourself actually . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
203.24	Put it in Project Documents , yeah . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Documents]
228.64	Um well , the function of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
249.35	Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
266.77	volume going up and down , and then mute , 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
270.47	a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_V_D]
294.88	And we can decide if that's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
303.4	These are two examples . Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . So you have functions that are d uh duplicating . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
451.35	Wait . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
536.87	Wait , is that like your 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
657.93	to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
678.74	You know like go to the base . Yeah . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
715.22	Help me . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1012.39	It'll give you the sports . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1024.44	You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , you know it's like 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1163.32	We should go for the lowest denominator . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1295.92	Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1331.76	Well , then we could If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1381.06	Well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1642.68	And then add a 	ES2010b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
91.56	I shall close the door . 	TS3011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
610.72	Well , I'll give it a try . 	TS3011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
790.3	Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one . Uh I also will propose some uh um 	TS3011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
821.86	uh some implementations for that , but well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . 	TS3011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
881.11	I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh 	TS3011a.C.words.xml	True	[nineteen, eighties]	[]	[]
922.41	Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look , but take these things into account when you start the discussion . 	TS3011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
952.07	Yes , so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment , and the way of communicating with these equipments . 	TS3011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1137.57	Well , I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords . You know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch w yes , to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . So maybe that's an idea , I don't know . 	TS3011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w, C_D]
1265.46	Okay . Do do you 	TS3011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1320.56	Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago , but I've seem to forget them forgot them . Um oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark . Um 	TS3011a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
294.22	Huh . So Matthew we were uh yeah , it's uh we were talking that we did some experiments to see if the word during meeting the words appear independently of the slides in a sense that uh if certain words tend to appear during certain slides or no . And uh the answer is uh no . And uh so we did a statistical test for that . And I will add also that we did that on the uh w the words after filtering them from the removing the the stop words . Yeah , so uh so uh bec s because yeah , with the stop words okay th there would be a reason for uh in independence because there is uh such a huge mess of them . But uh even uh after removing them uh there it it remains uh independent . 	IN1016.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Matthew, bec, s]
1115.9	Link uh 	IN1016.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1272.62	Uh no . No . But for the other thing , you know uh uh the alternative measures . Or maybe we should finish with this first . Uh I mean uh 	IN1016.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2472.22	And we could uh do automatical uh speaker rating if there are good speakers or bad speakers depending if they just read uh 	IN1016.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2795.39	Yeah , aro around February or March . So really um 	IN1016.A.words.xml	True	[around, February, or, March]	[]	[]
2802.51	Yeah . So to find something for that . Uh also with the th thinking maybe turning this uh work into publication , the one about the for sure . 	IN1016.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2820.2	And uh also uh uh well that uh depends a little on on on you . But try to finish with the um measures and the call routing . 'Cause I was talking with that uh about that to Herve uh since I was uh I will recycle this poster for I_M_ two , you know , about uh about this . And uh that could be cool to to finish it . Maybe fuse it with uh Ian's work and uh do a journal paper he was suggesting . 	IN1016.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ian]
3261.82	But who really can do uh when somebody will really be able to do that , I mean detect the speech from non-speech , it will be a little revolution , no , in the 	IN1016.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3514.77	Yeah and I think uh that will be exactly one hour and uh uh fill the tape . Uh the tape is sixty minutes . Ah so I was right . 	IN1016.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
576.76	One point four or something like that . One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that . 	ES2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro, Pound]
708.61	Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like 	ES2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
794.46	Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus . And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe . 	ES2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[h, L_C_D]
816.27	You mean to save it lesser number . 	ES2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
950.91	It might it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . But it might have its cost implications . 	ES2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
403.0	Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Um . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Uh . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . 	IS1000b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
552.37	Yeah . Um , s hang on . 	IS1000b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
626.82	And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . 	IS1000b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
631.65	Yes , I'll just get this up . 	IS1000b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
725.37	This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um . 	IS1000b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
767.67	Yep , that one . Just follow that link . 	IS1000b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1198.49	That's handy . So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . 	IS1000b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2012.59	Mm . But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . 	IS1000b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
54.34	I'll briefly go through the uh 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
139.47	mm uh use it . And that it shouldn't be too small , mm that it it gets lost . 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
158.68	uh I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations . Uh before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that um the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . Um the uh 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
267.69	Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . Um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background . 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[teletext]
687.94	Yeah , I must say that um the uh I c can't remember what um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sorta]
864.34	That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at um well again , we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups . 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
915.63	It c well it I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[I_T_V]
936.19	just to activate it . Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
971.76	Vol volume , yes um th w we need to s identify things that people actually need and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ig, w]
998.02	uh would appear to be essential . 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1009.66	know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey , um 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[grey]
1032.26	Do , please . 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1071.99	print actually print it on the uh 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1093.46	could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1149.03	S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um 'cause we're 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1492.48	actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the uh such a source , um you know , compromise the our our need for uh you know , it it being 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1535.62	but uh uh I think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , you know , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . Um and nothing else . 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1810.16	you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's uh , you know never needs replacing . Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , uh um you know , one some sort of typical usage . You know , the the the battery will last 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1829.64	know , five , ten years . 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[five, ,, ten, years]	[]	[]
1842.05	uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1850.88	Yeah , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll give 'em a new one . Um it's , you know , it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a well , it's actually a marketing gimmick . I mean it's hardly a gimmick , it's uh it's totally practical . Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1992.9	I would think is 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2025.11	Oh , I must admit I hadn't um I'd I'd missed that . That does sound excessive . 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2077.65	Right , so I've got a message to say five minutes , I dunno how long ago that appeared . Um 'cause we're we're getting um right , so I'd I need to sum up very quickly here um . We're looking at extreme simplicity . 	ES2012b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
249.41	I'll go . Um this is my picture . I drew fish I like fish , because uh , you know , their whole water-vascular system thing . It's pretty cool , and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes , sometimes vicious but that's okay . Yeah . 	ES2010a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
282.07	No I I see it . Yeah , it does look like a cat . 	ES2010a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
555.25	Yeah , if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_ . 	ES2010a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[A]
163.06	What we are uh we might see it uh in very simple way that we are using some Hilbert transform h at the beginning to create analytic signal . The analytic signal is the signal which is a complex which you can create from the uh real uh uh some sequence . And if you get if you apply Hilbert transform on this , on such a speech signal , like a real trajectory , then you get a complex signal and if you take just the amplitude , then you get Hilbert envelope code . So I well I I don't know . Yeah , let's say ups . 	IN1013.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Hilbert, Hilbert, Hilbert]
216.36	Uh you're lit I know what you mean with the pu P_L_P_ . They are applying P_L_P_ with some iteration with this this one approach . So they are doing some smoothing of a spectrogram in two ways . One was right . Right . But P_L_P_ is using just the spectral uh direction . Let's say you are doing uh for every twenty millisecond processing one one feature vector . Here you are processing one spectral band , frequency band , right . So it's different direction which we are w using . But anyway , this is very simple . So applying that uh absolute uh absolute operation , you get a Hilbert envelope . 	IN1013.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[pu, P_L_P, Hilbert]
560.08	Yeah . But I think this appr approach can do that because you really can split it into several bands . And you can decide how many bands you want more or less . So 	IN1013.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[appr]
686.29	Right . Right . Exactly . You just apply L_ L_P_ , so auto-correlation let's say , or you can do power spectrum , whatever . Yeah , so you for each one you get L_S_F_s here . 	IN1013.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L, _, L_P]
1085.81	Exactly . What we can also do very simple is just to get the magnitude spectrogram using this approximation without the carrier , just Hilbert envelope . But you just uh get it in in this way , in in the way of Rob's , right . But you can also get the s short time Fourier transform uh and keep it right . Just classical uh frame by frame algorithm , twenty milliseconds . Uh but you keep just the phases instead of magnitudes . And you can put this together , right . And it works pretty well , and then the signal is not uh just uh whispered . Then you really hear that there is the voiceness in the signal . But uh of course the quality is uh is not so good still . But uh you can use it for like two , three kilo-bits per second and it works . 	IN1013.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Hilbert, Rob, s, algorithm]
1379.29	Well , but the sinusoidal coding is usually m when you s at least what I think or uh what I know is when you are doing sinusoidal coding it means you just take the speech signal at the beginning , right . And you are trying to find to uh yeah , to find the harmonics in a temporal domain , right , for that . 	IN1013.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1586.22	But for example what we also found is that if you use just the Hilbert envelope , that that one which is trying to approximate that energy in some low band , like ar around two hundred t uh hertz , and you take a look on the signal , on the trajectory , you can see that it works like kind of um voice detector . Because uh for a low energies there is usually noise . For high energies there is kind of a harmonicity . So it works pretty well for that . So we might use this one information for that . But 	IN1013.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Hilbert]
1715.13	How does it look like or sure . 	IN1013.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1903.48	Yeah , it's it is very different , yeah . Then you are doing in different domain . I think this is in frequency domain , this in time domain . Um it is quite it's quite sensible to any quantization , what I found . Really it looks like the lines . So you just say okay , let's p let's put the line there . But it doesn't work . Re well , you can understand . But you can here that there are many artifacts which right , exactly . 	IN1013.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1988.71	No , after D_C_T_ you are trying this is so kind of again a real trajectory , right . And you're trying to first find that Hilbert envelope . So uh let's well so this is a speech . No , but here what I want to say is really that y it's not part of Hilbert envelope , it's part of the D_C_T_ signal . So it's not it's enough if you have just this phase and f and the Hilbert envelope , you can put it together . You don't need the carrier . I mean this is kind of a carrier signal but in different domain represented . 	IN1013.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_C_T, _, Hilbert, Hilbert, D_C_T, _, f, Hilbert]
2690.12	Uh it seems to me , yeah , something like that . Like try 	IN1013.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2933.19	Well I can imagine kind of like J_ PEG operations , which might be more less like it's source coding and then we also channel coding because we just smooth the or just I don't know . I don't know . 	IN1013.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[J, _, PEG]
167.0	uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
219.83	Oh yeah , of course , yeah . G go on ahead . 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
386.73	Um . Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most . Just a couple of minutes anyway . 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
411.0	Mm-hmm . Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now . 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
537.48	Okay , right . Well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this . Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
643.63	Okay , right . Um okay , if we can move on to next presentation then please . Um 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
651.99	Do you wanna 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1021.65	Okay . So want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities . Okay . 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1224.57	I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . So um anybody anything there to add Just kind of young professionals , uh th like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . So we could say that was our target . 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1257.61	Mm-hmm . Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . You know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing . 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1353.15	Okay . Uh okay , well do you wanna um give us your presentation and then then we can I don't know um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we're Yeah , exactly , yeah . Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . Um . 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[reco]
1820.02	Okay , so just stick to to regular 	ES2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
47.87	So just cancel it . 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
243.16	Yeah , I'll start . 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
254.23	Geez , and sli and show . 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
357.2	take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_C, _]
558.73	Succeed in it also . 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
626.21	And what's the um if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
819.0	Yeah , well it should just have a design 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
872.51	Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it . 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
959.44	But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something . Well if you lost th I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . Uh that's just uh 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, T_V]
1144.88	Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . So 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1289.66	But does it uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , should we just use a 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1577.34	Just elder elder people would would buy it , but 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2011.74	Well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition . 	TS3011b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
444.14	Suppose . 	EN2001e.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
486.6	Hmm . That's just 'cause they would have a blank line in it . Seems a bit stupid . But I can fit 'em back in if 	EN2001e.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1056.39	Uh I'm still in my directory , but I I can put it in your directory . 	EN2001e.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2941.2	Yeah , I can change that . 	EN2001e.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2948.04	Yeah , just to change the index files as well . 	EN2001e.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3118.95	Yeah well , we'll work on it , yeah . 	EN2001e.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3314.24	Yeah , we could do that . 	EN2001e.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]

983.17	Mm . Guess . 	TS3003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
196.34	I can address some of that issue , I think , with uh my presentation . 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
303.12	Mine will always read copy of something or other . I I copied mine before I sent it over . 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
644.08	An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode , um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . Next slide , please . Thank you . Uh personal preferences , uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L_E_D_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it . 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_E_D, _]
719.57	Yeah . Um certain restrictions do apply here though . Uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . Double-curved , you can't do titanium . Um that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . Now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . And uh so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . I think I have one more slide . No , I didn't . 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[latex]
763.64	Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . So depends on what we decide we wanna do . In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone . But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes . 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
934.16	I I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know I think we'd have to decide on the power options , maybe . So that we could reduce cost . Yeah . 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1167.11	Honestly I'd recommend like um uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex , because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour . We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so , because this year is all fruit , God only knows why , um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	True	[this, year, this, year, next, year]	[]	[God]
1207.11	They could come back . And buy the extra case . So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start . 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1261.41	Well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing . 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1284.97	Yeah , see that would just irritate me . 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1473.47	Mm yeah . We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know . 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[oth]
1509.62	We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available . 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1598.72	It'll wear off . 	ES2010c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
99.25	I've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me . 	IS1008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Christine]
128.67	No it's think it's the last one . 	IS1008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
151.38	from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . 	IS1008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
165.9	Um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . Um , so 	IS1008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[menu, L_C_D]
184.71	to unveil our lovely product . 	IS1008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
195.54	So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . Um , this is actually hard to do . The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . 	IS1008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
251.8	Oh yes . Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control . 	IS1008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
355.22	So , I mean I can pass this around if anyone wants to 	IS1008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
894.08	Yeah . You can do a shipping centre somewhere , or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs . 	IS1008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
918.6	That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , whereas if you're in a store , you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want , whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and 	IS1008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1037.25	Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use it's not a trivial task . 	IS1008d.C.words.xml	True	[two, weeks]	[]	[]
56.74	So you can um start s checking by y well you you know , you can order it in any way you like , but um start with the first channel and go through it entirely . Um I would recommend , I've found that it's easier when you're checking and you're trying to make sure the boundaries are right for a speech segment , I would recommend , like say this one , go down here to the uh trascription transcription tier and select that it so that uh when you play , you're certain that when it stops , you've caught the whole speech signal for that utterance and haven't lost any signal information . Um otherwise it it's liable to keep on running , and you might not notice where it where it finishes . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
110.39	So it it takes a little time . But um Alternatively , I you you could just listen to the speech segments again and make sure everything is correct for those , and so you could just hit um 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
133.17	Like that . And then go back and check the the silence regions . How it if if you wanna make your job a little more interesting , you can d do it in m different ways on a different day . It doesn't matter . As long as it gets done . So 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
223.23	do a search for , yeah , find replace for open parentheses and that'll take you to any that it any that the first transcriber might have marked out . So there's one . And then you can just resolve those all one by one as as a different set of um changes altogether . And and likewise for the double question marks . Just once you've gone through um and resolved all the open parentheses , you can do the same for op uh double question marks . And um and like I said , if you if you can't make any sense of it , then just use the at symbol . If you can um , just give it , you know , give it your best guess in these cases . If 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
286.41	Yeah , it's I would uh if you're v if you're quite certain , then I would go ahead and um type what you think it was said . If if you v think that n y there's maybe a th thirty percent chance you're wrong or or more 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
363.76	You'll you'll know all too well what was said in this meeting by the time you 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
370.39	Yeah . Yeah , I think that would be really helpful . That would help us um , you know , nab a good number of those uncertainties . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
387.59	Choose one , it c I mean y think of it from a speech recognition point of view again . And always this should be this should motivate you . Yeah . What is most robust for a speech recognition and and leave out anything So you're well geared towards this task . Um So I've gone through Sorry . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
416.83	Oh no no no . Go ahead , go ahead . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
484.96	Um , no no no . Whatever um makes sense to you . Um but no , it it can continue into the next segment and that's perfectly fine . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
519.92	I'll review some of these things um after I go through this a bit um just to re-cap . Th these are things that I've after checking um t everybody's work um , these are things that were commonly left out or , you know misc mis-transcribed , whatever . So I'll go over those t as an opportunity to use the white-board . Um um okay . So uh this person left out a lot of end punctuation and um here's a case where I think she was transcribing an out-breath um or possibly an in-breath uh t uh in and used the hash mark . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
609.92	Yeah . S there's there's actually quite a bit more in there than than I heard before . This is so I w I heard a creaky voice , and it was audible of the level of the rest of the speech . So I would I would keep that . I think that's good . Oh , okay . I was adding that , that's what I was doing . That makes sense . Okay , there you go . Um so there's things like that . Um sh there's a missing false start here um that didn't get caught . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
671.28	Try to get it right . I mean the it I think syllables should be accounted for for th 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
738.01	Yeah . Yeah . Make your best guess . Try to listen to it carefully enough , but not not so that you're obsessing over it for too long . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
748.61	I would say . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
917.31	Oh , evaluation . Yeah , I I've I remember that . That one I would I would flag , just like you did . It that's something definitely to mark up . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
972.47	Okay . So oop , I lost my lapel lapel mic . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
978.45	Yeah . Wait . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
997.89	Okay , so um there've there've been lots of missed filled pauses . Everybody seems to miss those , some more than others . So just really keep an ear out for those . Um 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1058.55	Yeah , yeah . So at this point the um the only file that's been checked is Melissa one that Melissa did , and that was checked by me . Um so w we we're starting fresh with these and , you know , changes like that that were just announced we'll we'll be able to catch for these first passes . So yeah , y if you do see um something like um U_H_M_ for um , you you would change that to the regularised v version . Um and we just ch you know , this is arbitrary , but we had to choose something and not let it get too convoluted with um with choice . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Melissa, Melissa, _]
1187.37	Let me see . Oh yeah . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1289.25	Yeah , yeah , yeah . If you have any questions about spellings , I i I think I m might have sent an email to this effect , just check the Oxford English Dictionary online . Uh and that's that will be our guide . Um , so a as far as I know , this is just missing an E_ cetera . Um but anyway . You can 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Oxford, English, Dictionary, _]
1313.85	We've considered experimenting with running this through a spell check . You could take this as an Emacs file and run a spell check on it . But I think it would slow things down too much . So just hopefully i in going through this very carefully you're going to notice these misspellings . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Emacs]
1359.75	Right . Yeah , I th I think you're right . So we'll we will just hope that you catch it . Um That's what we'll do . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1399.11	A space between She would like see . She would like see . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1411.67	Exactly . Uh that was what you were m remarking about . Okay . There we go . Let me save that . Okay . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1466.29	Then use um 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1472.42	Mm-hmm . I'd have to hear it , because it m sounds like it could be a fragment . Uh it ju I'd just have to hear it . Um M I'd you don't want to b um be prescriptive and and type what you think they should've said . But 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M]
1490.79	but I I I do know the type of scenario you're describing . I just it's just hard to answer that without hearing something . Mm . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
1510.49	Uh let's see . Oh yeah , y you're right . Right . That's right . Okay . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1577.22	If you hear just laughter on either side , yeah , do that . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1592.78	Okay , so laughter during speech . I'll f I'll talk to Melissa and Jean . S 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Melissa, Jean]
1625.79	I'll figure that one out and put it up on the wiki or email you . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1631.91	Good question . I've come across that as well . Mm , see . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
1654.51	Um let's see . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1726.44	Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Um y that may be , but I probably would flag it . I depending on how how different the vowel sound was . It's gonna be your call in a lot of these cases . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1814.85	Uh yeah , yeah . Yeah , I would type it as two . Mm okay , I'm gonna skip ahead . Oh , let's see , there was a c 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
1882.54	So d even if it's something as brief as mm-hmm , we're we're gonna go ahead and capitalise that . And Maarika asked me what to do in the case of an utterance just consisting of laughter , do we do we use punctuation in these cases , and I don't know . I haven't been . I don't think it's necessary . Yeah . Uh no . Um 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Maarika]	[mm]
1950.27	Yeah . So like I said , click down here just to if you haven't learned that trick already . And that won't play any surrounding segments . So there's nothing there worth transcribing . Um 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2092.95	So here's let's see . Now this was our 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2108.18	But I you can see how it could've been , I don't know . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2163.0	I hear the well there . The but this being a head-set mic channel m may make it easier to hear . She transcribed from the lapel mic . Uh 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2305.7	I d I did see s I've been looking at some guidelines for another corpus and I did see something about proper names , so I'll I'll have a look at that and see how we can handle that here . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
2342.19	Yeah , yeah , because everyone signs a consent form when they participate in the experiment . So we ought to be able to get that . But but there shou we should also have a w a means of dealing with proper names when we don't know what it is or how it might be spelled at all and and flagging that in in some way . So I'll th I'll I'll try to address both things . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2452.45	Oh yeah yeah . If you if if f it's a foreign word and you know what it is , just enclose it in carets . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
2504.05	It is O_K_A_Y_ . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Okay . Well , it will be your jobs to catch all of these things . So no um n no transcriber will be checking no checker will be checking their t own transcription . Yes . Yes . So we will catch these things 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[O_K_A_Y, _]
2555.69	Okay . So I guess just for the sake of using the white-board and killing a little more time I'll just write down the things that are most common to be checked . So let's see . So oh , okay . Now . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2586.61	Then check the speech regions . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2608.16	Um transcribe 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2621.06	And just let's see what else . Okay . And within this checking the speech segments , you want to listen for or look for missed um 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2633.87	Look for missed punctuation , 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2677.34	And what else . Try to get f false starts . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2686.98	Short words , make sure with little words like the and uh , little articles and that kind of thing don't get omitted . Um short words and word fragments . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2707.57	And then um look for cases of mis-transcription 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2716.75	Seems so silly to be writing this all . But anyway , Mis-transcription , so make sure if the speaker said will , you type will not would or um if they say we , even though it might be more grammatically correct to type we're , um that kind of thing . Um tha cases of ellipsis , where um maybe the transcriber typed them , but really what was said was 'em , so where you use the apostrophe . And look for capitalisation I'm not gonna gonna do any more of this . Capitalisation . Spelling . Um , use the O_E_D_ to check on things you don't know about . Um refer to the wiki for all regularised spellings and f for things like filled pauses . Oh , was that 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[O_E_D]	[Capitalisation]
2776.92	And then , yeah , capitalise the K_ . Yeah . And 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
2783.31	I think smells really good . I used to always love smelling markers . What else did I find . Um the so make sure the da the dash , the hyphen , whatever you call it , is being used appropriately in cases of discontinuity , um but not in stuttering , like I said . And and don't use it when the utterance is clearly continued in the next segment or whatever . Um don't transcribe in-breaths or out-breaths . And okay should never be um two capital letters , it should be O_K_A_Y_ . Um and one other thing is to break break up long segments if you find any . So 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[O_K_A_Y, _]
2838.8	Yeah , but that's a kind of crude guideline . I'd I'd say just anything that seems unmanageable . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2849.38	Ah . Yeah , yeah . Really uh it it means nothing to say a minute , it's just a g a really crude guideline . I would just try to keep segments very manageable um and a but u you know , use these wave-forms to help you . And you can adjust the resolution so that Oh . That didn't help me too much , but you can use this little slide bar to adjust the resolution . Actually that doesn't seem to be working . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2937.24	Oh that's that's good to know . Okay . Yeah , so to help you make cuts , just look look f you know , use this wave-form and make sure you're not l losing any signal information . But um cutting segments down is a l a low priority , but it it will help ultimately , I think , post-processing wise . I don't 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
3056.92	Yeah , I'd say for now um w we don't even have uh much new stuff to be uh to be gone over for a first pass . So it's important that we d um do this second pass . And I've indicated in a column whether something is priority . M I think I high typed high if it's high priority . Um so d those would be the ones you would focus on first , obviously . And when it come you don't want to change the file-name in any way . Just keep it the same . Um there there is going to be a checking in procedure . I don't know if anybody's mentioned this before , but you'll you'll know about this with the C_V_S_ server . So th 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M, C_V_S, _]
3105.9	Right , but it's be s y similar . But they're they're creating a their a guy Jonathan is creating a web form for you to do this all very simply and like just um upload everything that you've uh up upload the file that you've transcribed and and you'll be noting whether it's the first pass or the second pass and y your name um as the person who did that particular pass . And that will happen soon . I'll let you know . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Jonathan]
3137.57	Yeah , you'll have to I would suggest creating a f folder um called files to be checked or something like that . Yeah , and then within that create a s create sub-folders for the the given meeting and you'll have to get all the sound files unfortunately from the M_M_M_ server on your own , because the the AMI server's not very reliable for getting these sound files uncorrupted . So you'll have to get all the sound files from the M_M_M_ server and the person's transcription file should be in that folder where you're putting yours . Um and then you'll just uh yeah d you'll copy that over , you won't don't move it over , because we wanna have multiple versions of these things , but yeah , copy it into your directory and keep the same name . And then when you check it in , it will automatically be registered even though the the first pass was checked in when we're doing this checking in business , um it will know which pass it is , but I think you'll also be indicating that as well . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[AMI]
3268.44	I should think so . I mean the whole point w of keeping well , as long as you're able to , yeah , work out use of your computer with the other person , that's fine , yeah . The the whole point of having m regular hours was to make sure that somebody was here to answer your questions . But you've got keys , so so you should be able to get in during odd hours if if you wanted to work . 	EN2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3356.68	If you have any th problems like that , mm um see Caroline Hastings . I mean if it's for this job and and getting paid , that that's not necessary and Caroline Hastings ought to be able to help you sort that out .

2183.78	So for example you can change you can change a number to take which one , okay . Okay , understand . In the other yeah yeah . Okay , perfect . 	IN1001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2291.77	Yeah , okay . Okay , understand . Okay . Yeah , it's not a real uh usi usage . Okay . 	IN1001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]

2416.08	Yeah , understand . 	IN1001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2500.8	Ah . okay . To make 	IN1001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2557.66	Work in progress . 	IN1001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2617.19	From outside of IDIAP we can access this . 	IN1001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[IDIAP]
2860.45	So we can forget tosh and uh use uh input se the input reader for the the M_ PEG we can re lo use uh open C_V_ . 	IN1001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M, _, PEG, lo, C_V, _]
2940.2	Okay . We can skip some frames . Okay . Yeah . 	IN1001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3113.57	So I will ask you or someone else , okay . 	IN1001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3121.04	Okay , okay , understand . 	IN1001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
21.68	Forget every time that the 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
65.88	Okay . Keep an eye if I'm dropping this 'cause just seem ah , as I said , it doesn't seem very s Perhaps sweater , or maybe if I set it here on the this brand thing . Are they on , yeah . On . 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
194.8	You could change your project . Do a P_H_D_ or uh yeah . 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[P_H_D]
356.43	Yeah . I'll do it . 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
954.57	We have to remember to include that in our evaluation , how they did the GIF improve your browsing experie 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[GIF, experie]
1030.35	We'll see what happens in the next few days . 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[the, next, few, days]	[]	[]
1040.86	Yeah we'll think about that . 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1059.67	I can send you right now . Like 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1222.12	we'll try and do Monday . Um I mean we could 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[Monday]	[]	[]
1432.02	Can have a look . 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1631.44	Yeah . 'Cause this I mean We have interim report of seven pages , and that's we can y yeah . We could p probably just expand that . 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1651.78	Yeah . And then I mean write about the evala evaluation and stuff . That's gonna be quite a few pages . But 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[evala]
2003.07	Excuse me . I just realised I haven't done that part yet . 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2024.66	To have for the start-up . Oh . To have for the start-up . Uh-huh . 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2054.38	Yeah g uh that was li like yeah , if I'll make a just index 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[li]
2164.82	see what Steve says about the re-evaluation and then like we'll keep in touch by email if we need 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Steve]
2190.12	We can just email if we need other 	EN2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
139.26	Uh , b Let me see it . Oh , that's the same . Oh . Very good . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
260.45	Um and then uh we'll send it to you and you can do the final revisions . I'm sure 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
393.36	Yeah . We would prefer to concentrate on the main 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
412.52	M m meet these milestones at Yeah . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M]
417.58	Like , you know , develop prototype GUI . We t you know , ah yeah we managed that nicely . Uh 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[GUI]
452.13	And you can say yeah . We uh say we are still aiming for the development to be complete on the or something . M . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
481.89	Yeah , that's right . I I really wanna do it . I mean it's not it's not gonna be difficult . If at least have all the information pop up that is already in the meta-data file . That's gonna be no work at all . So it's definitely gonna be something there . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
501.3	Yeah , it might turn out easier than thought . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
537.74	We should probably d sorry , we should probably do another responsibility of packages as well . That's what he hinted that we should also um indicate who who is responsible for what from now on . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
557.64	Well you could put , you know yeah , I don't know . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
930.8	Yeah . I mean we could we could order them by meeting , for example . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
938.46	How to order it . Yeah well , I mean uh if , you know , that's uh you even a second step , the first question is do we want to order them . How do we wanna order them in the first place . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
957.25	Yeah , maybe we should do that . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1015.61	If you if you do it straight from you know , you get th you get the result , and then there's some if statement saying s straight on the , you know , rock bottom lev level saying if th if you found a segment , then colour it print it in red or whatever , and 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1041.38	Ah . Well , have a look . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1053.36	Yeah , yeah , I can imagine . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1122.14	Um no , but I know what it's called . And that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well . As I said , you know , if you if you left-click on something for example , it highlights automatically . So maybe it comes with something clever as well . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1237.2	Yeah , only only print out certain um certain segments , the segments that we want just selectively . At the moment it prints out all of them . We'll just put an if loop in it that leaves out some of the print statements . Not not store it at all whatsoever . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1344.16	You could nearly do it together with with uh the transcription with the original transcription , have them run parallel . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1351.86	So if certain , you know if it's a proper word , print it on both both panes , and if it's not a proper word , then print it only on one . But I mean that's that's , you know , fancy , but 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1385.99	So But I mean you can , you know , you can write we can write something like um we'll try and do it on the fly and and observe if if that gonna is gonna take too long . If it's gonna take too long , we'll think about writing it to a file and doing it off-line . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1617.99	Maybe you could split that up and 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1729.65	Yeah . And then send it on to us so we can nod . 	EN2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3.75	Yeah . Yeah . Look at all this stuff man . Okay . Right . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
234.62	Add more buttons . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
238.9	Yeah . Well in uh I guess in in In meeting browser one point one , you can have a menu instead of a button but this why I don't think it Yeah . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
286.06	I guess so . It's an idea . Get to use my pen . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
504.56	Sometimes you do it by accident though . You , oh go away . Stop coming up . Yeah . No . Yeah , yeah , oh yeah . T throw stuff throwing out the window . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
565.81	Probably not , but we might need them for disfluencies , if we try do it in audio . But at the moment , no . But yeah . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
577.91	We might want to be able to say oh , just give me what that person's saying . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
905.04	You can make it if you make it world readable , then anybody can access it . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1083.43	I've been trying to g write something to read the X_M_L_ and get rid of it . And I can get rid of it , but I'm having trouble putting it anywhere else . So it will come up on the screen For the moment I haven't managed to put it into a vector or whatever in Java to play with it . But I guess it's not very difficult . Yeah , in Java , yeah . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L, Java, Java]
1148.9	Should share as much as possible . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1306.98	Four , and it w it li it just has an open variable transparent s list , whatever , find everything that's got that and then load 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1372.1	Oh see , obvious 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1391.33	Fish the data , I was just thinking that , yeah . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1436.89	Commen commenting it out one bit at a time and running it , does it work , yeah . Okay , get rid of that , next . Good fun , aye . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Commen]
1469.91	Well , should you find you want to explore any other perhaps you as your um uh quantify raising . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1823.06	Can take us for a tutorial sometime . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1915.8	The k the f there's computer rooms in here , the M_S_C_ computer lab and uh is in here . Well if you find me , I'll show you where I'll I'll let us all in there , and we can all go in there . Yeah , yeah . You do need to have a key for it . Like that's the thing . It's got a lock door button . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[k, f, M_S_C, _]
1932.21	Yeah , somebody will answer it . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2034.37	Nah , make 'em work . 	EN2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nah]
49.9	Okay . So I think it's better to first have a presentation of my work and then we can discuss uh with this crash in temp in temp uh what we can do uh for my future to to continue my research , because apparently I I will have serious problems , okay . So I will start with the presentation of my work . 	IN1002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
274.27	Um the the difference is that we do one more step , uh maybe I can explain it better there . So we do one more step here , and we uh here by means of another H_M_M_ we introduce some kind of uh prior knowledge and contextual information , we get better evidences than what i we initially had here , and then we do the uh decoding and the and s more informative posteriors uh uh instead of this one . 	IN1002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[H_M_M]
365.76	possible transition between phonemes and some kind some uh more prior knowledge like uh which wo like uh which word is composed of which phonemes and uh g uh gram grammatical knowledge ab uh about transition between words and things like this . So as you see , introducing more reasonable prior knowledge um will h help to have better performance in almo in almost all the cases . 	IN1002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ab]
453.96	So if you want now we can discuss about um uh the crash and the loss of data , so uh well I lost all the posteriors I was I uh I used as input uh for my system , so the gamma are somehow estimated or computed on top of posteriors . And now I don't have any posterior and uh probably the scripts generating that posterior , so what I can do okay . 	IN1002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1080.35	Well , I also had the of generated posteriors or gammas or things like this , which I should regenerate , I have the uh scripts but uh well it takes time , it's C_P_U_ and regenerating all these things , but okay , it's okay . So there is no major problem except time . Deadline of two weeks for ICAS . Okay . 	IN1002.B.words.xml	True	[two, weeks]	[]	[C_P_U, ICAS]
1630.4	Ah . Well I I think w after this meeting we can t we can try together to regenerate this . Well uh P_L_P_s I think th they should be first regenerated , then posteriors , and if by the end of week we could have posteriors , then it's not that difficult , I can easily regenerate the gammas and do all the experiments again . Maybe it's a 	IN1002.B.words.xml	True	[the, end, of, week]	[]	[]
1861.72	Try yeah . 	IN1002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2058.66	And what if we have some day a fire in IDIAP , we will lose all the data . 	IN1002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[IDIAP]
2065.63	Mm I mean , but they have well I I think w they can and yeah , they can d you know , store it somewhere . But you know , here we can easily have a fire , because the everything is made of wood I think and it's small and 	IN1002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
238.91	Yeah , supposedly all calculated , yeah . Um and all stored as objects , so dot object files . Um which means that you just ret call constructor and call the load thing and call it there and you can create a list of them or a vector of them or whatever you wanna do , yeah . And then or just call them one at a time to populate window . But that's what I wanted to how y how what format do you want the data to come back in . 'Cause it can come back as a almost anything . What's easiest to display on the screen . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
429.5	'Cause at the moment I'm using there is there are methods that say um for the using , for other talks . So that's and it says like get get talk time , and you and y it takes a name , so that w could call that would call that and call the meetings method that said return that , and that would populate that , which should be an easy thing to do . Um and the same for that , comes out there . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
471.99	Yeah , okay . So I'll w I'll just leave in lots of methods that st that'll just return one number at a time . That'll be the easiest way to do , yeah . Okay , yeah , that's fine . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[st]
495.71	No , it's stored as an object file . It processes a whole lot off-line and stores it as an object , and then they're much much smaller . They're only like a one um one thou one K_ . Yeah , it's all pre-processed . And then it's just each method object's got a return bunch of return methods . You have to g re-create the object . It's got a load method . So what you do is you call a null constructor , 'cause if you call the th proper constructor for each meeting , it goes off and does all the processing and stores own object . And then um if you call a null constructor , then you pr call load and you can call load and whatever one or all of them or anything like that . Go through a list . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
543.24	Yeah . It's just tell it tells you who participated . At the moment it tells you who participated and the amount they participated in percentages , and in time as well . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
567.52	Oh yeah . No , topic specified , yeah have a default , yeah . There are some there are some default actually . The um a lot of people don't get their own ch and other stuff . But 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
642.79	Mm no , design the GUI first , and uh 'cause it it w the problem is if you change the classes , it the object's serial numbers change and you can't re-load the object , so all the processing has to be done over again . And I haven't quite finished it . So 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm, GUI]
656.05	It would become out of synch and get a bit funny . If I gave you one if I gave you it one and you worked on it , and then I changed it and run the thing again , you wouldn't ever be able to load the objects back up . And you'd have to and then you'd have a v multiple copies of objects all over the place and it'd get silly , I think . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
676.37	But if you can if you wanna make the picture c you can do that without anything , I'm presuming . Ju just the That , yeah . The text box . 'Cause that doesn't Okay . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1018.48	Yeah . Or a switch-board that comes up that's just a blank form like that with some buttons on . Load me a meeting , load me a search , load me something else . Whistle a tune . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1093.68	It has to be an observation , and even if you go and se you can go and search the whole corpus from that , but you have to have it has to start with something for some bizarre reason . The engine there's only one there's only one search method to the search engine . Uh the engine class only has one search method . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1302.14	Yeah , yeah . Ma make it strings for as long as possible , and then only return the things when they actually needs to has to search . When it needs to be loaded . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ma]
1322.45	Did we think about um 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1390.58	Yeah , to do um what Steve's talking about you do . To do the topic labelling . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Steve]
1504.29	I did do it once , I do have a Java class that does it for something , I don't know whether it'll work with this . But 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Java]
1526.6	Yeah . also key-words gives you a a whole new type of search . You do keyword search . But you could do key-word search could be topic search , can they can be the same thing . Instead uh it would just search for key-words when it when they you tell him that with topics , but actually get searching with key-words . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[keyword]
1579.73	No , you can do you can do search without T_F_I_D_F_ , you just can't rank the search . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_F_I_D_F, _]
1646.84	Yeah . Well it'd just give you a rank . It would that was the whole point was to if you say , this is your top one , this is your bottom . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1703.03	in its most simple form it would do a separate rank for each one , each term . You could make it more complicated and make it do for th for the yeah . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1714.08	Yeah . You can just add 'em up , or you can 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1732.24	I guess you just do a sum of the um of the the individual T_F_I_D_F_ for each term returned , and that generally will be a bit crude , but it will give you a d score , and the higher the more uh more informative each term is for each thing would give you a 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_F_I_D_F, _]
1978.8	Uh you can have a save preferences . You could have a save preferenc preferences , I guess . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1987.95	Well alright , call it favourites then . You can have a favourites . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2080.96	Or search , yeah , yeah . So if even if it just had two things , just said one sai one said take me straight to this meeting and have a m text-box you can enter it , or a drop down menu . And then another that said search that loaded instantly . It loaded up the search screen . Yeah . Yeah yeah , or one that yeah , or one that 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sai]
2121.22	And then that brings up the browser after you f searched for something . Or or the search but the search window could have on it something that said just has a drop down menu that says just and a go button that said take me to this . And so the f so the in yeah , so the f only thing that comes up when you're finished is a um when you start it's just one window like that and it's got all the search stuff like down there . And so this is your search . It's just all here , and here is just go to wherever and a go button . And then from there it takes you to wherever else you wanna go . Yeah . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2197.33	This is good , but if you wanna search a search , if you wanna look for one meeting and just look at it , then that's fine . Um that's that's true , that's or unless you have two . One one is one one there where you got two , one for meeting , one to speak . Or and you can choose , you can go go for go or go for the other . Go on go for both . If you go for both , you're searching 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2233.7	We could do Microsoft stylie and hold it over and it pops up a thing . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Microsoft]
2270.76	Yeah , that's true , that's annoying . But that's why you could just have a list of your users then . And just you just say I wanna look for this user . Go . Find me . Find me , then then then it pulls up a list of all the ones who got that user in it . And then you search then but then you didn't search . Maybe just leave it , just have them there , and don't worry about the speakers . If they're doing speakers , they're doing search . It's not the same as doing a a quick access . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2301.16	Yeah . Or you can have a f text box there that's got yeah , as you go over them . Then that doesn't get in your in the way . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2328.44	Yeah . We can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near loading up a 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2436.95	Yeah , I should have more to talk about . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2504.53	Two . Should we say three o'clock and then if there's a v serious problem , I'll tell you . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2568.98	Then we'd know who's missed them or who's if we've done any . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2684.26	Yeah , that would help a lot for that s for single terms it would be very useful . For multiple terms , unless you wanna do something there will be a way of doing it for multiple terms . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2697.24	Yeah . Or you could do it and override it by the you ca you could just ignore the d ranking if it doesn't show up together . Or you could perhap you could penalize it , you could just put a b weight against it . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2729.81	Yeah , might have to talk to Pernilla about that . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pernilla]
2742.86	'Cause some things you're gonna get a lot of results for . And if the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom when it was actually the most relevant one , something like that would just push it up . 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2834.41	Look through them all , yeah . One at a time and 	EN2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
610.38	They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , so , and chew 'em up . 	IS1008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
615.35	And chew 'em up . 	IS1008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
941.01	If you can find me , where I'm at . 	IS1008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1019.42	And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use . The first one , I see that they put in a display . 	IS1008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1072.94	Because I've seen mostly the standard ones , yeah . Now you have it now you have one with the very simple also . The idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you're doing . So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , 	IS1008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1163.32	Although , what it was it uh it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours . Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions , millions . 	IS1008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nokia]
1177.95	So . So say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new . We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market . 	IS1008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
1254.2	come up with a nice product . 	IS1008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1366.66	Um , no that's no problem . I'm here for the pushing it after it's made . I will market it . Once we get a price on it then we can market it . 	IS1008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
86.4	Look's good . 	EN2001b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
224.68	Yes , we can do that . 	EN2001b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
763.62	Yeah , think so . 	EN2001b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2075.88	Well , um when it splits the topics up , it does do it on regular words that um that occur . But it doesn't tell you what they are , no . 	EN2001b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3323.36	Yeah . Yeah , just send us an email and tell us what's happening . 	EN2001b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
796.98	Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . Uh , can you go on to the next slide , please . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
858.84	And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit . Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller . If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . And it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures . Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should uh be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures . And uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wi]
926.05	Uh a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . A battery uh , I would like to suggest one thing uh if we 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
968.32	And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller . Can you go to the next slide , please . And how it works , how the remote controller works . When you press a button 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
986.39	Thank you . Uh when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . Suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed . It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1018.28	Every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . Like you have got a signal by pressing a button . That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[butto, button]
1046.9	Now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . That is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do . Then it will do the appropriate action . So uh this is how the remote controller works . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1086.08	Can you go to the next slide , please . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1099.16	And where we had a a few buttons and all . And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also a capac uh a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm yeah , and di and a diode transistor . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[circui, circuit, board]
1134.12	Yeah , di um can y uh you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_A]
1142.74	Uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors , and uh just beside that you can see a transistor , and a uh uh cylinder shape , uh that one is a capacitor . Uh and also there are uh um resistors uh sorry , ther there is a diode . Can you go go on to the next slide . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1164.98	So uh this is the circuit board . The green one is a circuit board . Actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive . Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper , because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires , it's it's better to go for printing , because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing , nothing like uh , you know , you don't need to use wires and all . It's not exactly wires we are using . It's just printing something on a board . Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[circuit, board, bo, board, k]
1206.71	So th that green uh thing is a circuit board , and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated uh th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , yeah , um integrated circuit . Can you go to the next slide , please . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1239.98	Next , please . And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip . Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . So that also we can have in a battery , uh or we can use solar sells . Uh . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1312.14	Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we can't use . Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print , um also infra it includes the infrared se sender . Um yeah the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma, j]
1353.52	No , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think . Now , nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all . So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons . Yeah uh yeah , push-buttons . Yeah . Yeah . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[ten, ten, years]	[]	[]
1588.75	So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think . 	IS1009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
62.78	Yeah . No , I'm just like sort of like preparing people for um it looks like it looks like really nothing . It looks like basically less than n th their stuff , but actually Dave has written a whole underlying different structure now and if we hooked it up with my display , then we should fairly easily from now get to a stage where we can like select individual segments and click on them , then play that part in a compressed way and display density information . Now at the moment the application is 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Dave]
209.97	So and and that already this part here already is dynamically created . Um shall I just load it with Jasmine's data , just to see a different Where's the 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Jasmine]
262.87	Uh let me t 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
319.46	Well wha wha what what's the differe so th this is reall 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
481.22	So always like a . So it should always , whatever , reduce it to half the original 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
492.72	Yeah . Yeah , well I guess that could be uh adaptable . 'Cause an an alternative view would be that you could sort of make it that it always is the same length . So if you like if the whole meeting is selected , it compresses the whole meeting to five minutes . Then if one um segment , uh w one topic is selected , then it plays this whole topic in five minutes . But that's sort of that gives people a bit less control over so maybe we should do it instead that it yeah , it c it you can spec 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
573.22	Shall we abandon the whole notion of seeing the whole m one whole group as one single thing and just work on a p certainly from now on probably for good that means . I mean 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
763.76	See there's there's one week after my dissertation . So we're f uh before the presentation of the prototype . Which I can work a lot lot lot on this . So that's good . Um 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[one, week]	[]	[]
801.22	Yeah , well the graphic display will definitely have more information . Um if we're at the moment abandoning abandoning the concept of displaying the whole series of meetings just because it's for us like more bureaucracy , more complexity , and it probably just won't give us any brownie points in the presentation . Or do you think it will , I mean do you thi like 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
992.6	Well I was thinking of just like really just a m more or less just imagine those are search results each like each of them sort of them sort of giving whatever . We should aim to get some names for segments , like just some extraction of something that we can call . And if it's just the single highest um importance measure o phrase of a segment , so that we have something to display for them . Like basically just a summarisation down to one segment . And it would just be a list like this and you click on one and then w you tho you know , then the whole bureaucracy kicks in like this gets the nota notification , this gets the notification . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1030.49	And then we could like we could sort of use the same thing for um yours and mine . Because yours would sort of give just the segment I_D_s and mine would give the start segment I_D_s . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[I_D_s, I_D_s]
1073.2	Yeah sure , sure sure . Um yeah . So in in your case like it would basically would probably say the utterance here or at least some part of the u yeah . And in my case it would say some name for the segment , and then you would just click on it and then like the whole thing would kick in . Like you c you click on it and and the selection moves and the display goes to that part . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1183.09	So what about a general layout like this that we have here , the dialogue acts and there the player b And here we'd have a search button and the similarity thing button . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1221.61	Alternatively we'll have like the whole thing running already when we do the presentation and we just arrange it manually . My c 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1481.94	Well alternatively we could always have sort of a third small component , whatever , like if this was the search results , and then they are just like something else that's part unwritten when Miles goes over this one it triggers that one to display it or something . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Miles]
1534.87	Yeah yeah , we will have . That's actually just gonna happen today and we will have proper segments as well . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
1544.14	Um the thing I remember , like I have to find out how to do it without redrawing the display each time , because the display at the moment does take , you see , like it takes a fraction of a segment to display , but probably too much to update it to completely repaint the whole thing every second . So um at the moment I'm just whenever it needs to be repainted , I'm not thinking about to do and just repainting the thing as a whole with a moving bar that's not a good idea . But until I think of something better , what I'll just do is I'll just I'll probably not have a moving bar the whole length , but just some indicator somewhere . Like whatever , just uh a triangle moving at the bottom for now or something . And then I can just like repaint a small area or something . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1800.86	Uh And then he'll see the final display and he'll realise that it was all fake , that we didn't actually do any of the work . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1890.91	So Jasmine , if if you got something like this and like this for for your current data , would that help in 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Jasmine]
1923.14	Can probably add a open file dialogue box with minimum effort because I think it's a ready-made component that returns a string for a file name . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2056.4	Yeah . Where do you think you can uh produce something like that . Like I think we should go for like for one group , not for the whole corpus . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2231.34	I b like would just I would find logical reasons for why you can sugg say peop 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[peop]
2375.99	Yeah , that's what Vera said . No . So you you'd you'd also say that it shouldn't be part of the importance measure if there's no F_ zero . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Vera]
2456.98	We should assume a n assume a non-linguistic user . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2462.92	But I think probably for us , like in developing it , it would be interesting . Yeah , so um I'll try the red green blue . Wha what's does anyone know what this hue and saturation thing , like what that no , nobody's done much colour work . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2487.92	Okay . Okay , well I guess I'll just take a look at the Photoshop colour cube or whatever it is , GIMP colour cube , and look at 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Photoshop, GIMP]
2722.58	Um so yours would always like yours would always be loaded in , I guess . Like you y there would only be one version of your data , and you can just override that version if you want . But you wouldn't have a file open dialogue box for that then . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2761.91	Okay , but like so make it an option which one it displays or which one it uses for the summarisation or 'cause it 'cause I was just thinking sort of so that both Jasmine and Vera could um see their data working and 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Jasmine, Vera]
2798.33	So we would have like each of those components for 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2929.41	No no , sure . Or maybe just start with just two like without even combining them in any sophisticated way . Just just two . Yep . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3015.29	But it might actu I think it might not really be worth it to be honest . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3053.44	And yeah , and then they can tune , fine-tune their measures . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3090.06	Yeah , I think that's what we should do . So the the thing is it's probably an easy task to read that rate , but it's probably more difficult to get an event automatically when it's changed . So that's why we might have to extend NITE clock and like override the function that react to that . Or like the rate is probably a property , which in the worst case we'd have to set public , but if we wanna react to it being changed automatically , we might have to . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3159.93	Yep . Yeah . Yep . And we could justify all sorts of stuff like that by r in the presentation by saying we deliberately tried to keep any complexity and numbers and stuff away from people . I think that's sort of a line we should go by in general , sort of saying yeah , we could've done oh so many th 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3280.25	'Kay listen , so why don't we meet after three then , because then I can like until three make sure that I have all the display c 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
3289.1	Yeah , sure , yeah . S oh so we could meet at five and I have the display code ready by then , which does the stuff like like having a bar where the position is and stuff . And 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3321.94	Yeah . Yeah , so we can meet in five in Apple at five in Appleton tower and just work on so I'll I'll have my displ I'll make sure that my display does all the stuff we've been talking about un until then . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Appleton]	[Apple, un]
3336.71	And then we'll put those things together . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3355.4	Yeah . But I mean like we we should discuss together which w like how the the search interacts with the rest . 	EN2001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
452.52	I w well let's send out the call as soon as possible , see what reactions we get . And then 	EN2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
459.88	See if we have to put on some restraints . 	EN2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
473.46	Let's see . 	EN2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
999.66	Um write into the call that we are considering the idea of having a poster session . 	EN2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1009.83	So people can indicate would they prefer to give a poster or a talk . But the ultimate decision is on our side because we have to see how it does it work out with the poster session , how does it work out with the talks . 	EN2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1070.51	throw a general suggestion at them . See what happens . 	EN2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1197.24	Yeah , might be interesting stuff coming in . Read something recently about 	EN2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1423.97	Mm-hmm . Adjust . 	EN2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1570.09	So far it's just a general statement of interest , what we intend to do . What we actually get to do we'll see later when we have the stuff . 	EN2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1651.9	to get the stuff done . 	EN2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1899.44	I could create us another calendar . 	EN2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
874.39	other inputs from the l public demands . I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
889.2	We can wind up . 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
893.17	Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions . 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
972.66	Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[the, this, year, an, year]	[Paris, Milan]	[]
1053.19	So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale , 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1069.99	from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1085.69	if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1098.81	We can make our study on this and 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1125.96	Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ . 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
1279.23	No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . So we can't go 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, L_C_D, L_C_D]
1420.93	Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates . 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1428.6	So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . Even then our product is going to be very good . Yeah . 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
1552.48	That's going to be an optional . If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no . 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1576.74	Yeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it . 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1593.08	In the same set , yeah , and and individual buttons to make them work . 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1670.83	But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options . 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1702.0	Yeah that's right . I mean you could just provide with an optional . 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1747.33	Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and 	IS1007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
403.91	Yeah , da 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
409.94	Uh what is the place , uh the the central I mean where we change the bus to yeah , in the yeah , maybe you can check the booklet . Yeah it's there , like I used to find bus numbers from book only . 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
498.05	It's like uh all the semi-tied covariance matrices or yeah . So did they reduce it's in between the direct covariance this is full covariance . Should try to reduce some parameters by tying . 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
610.76	It's really computationally really uh yeah so see suppose if thirty nine in te thirty nine to thirty nine for every yeah , yeah , so 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
635.54	Yeah , thirty you can see you c you can't really like even you can't the models itself is like thirty eight times more than that , so . So y if you have like five megabytes or ten megabytes of models then yeah . But even I think it's really bit like impossible for the really big systems I guess , like storing storing itself . 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
689.21	Speak uh yeah , different task and 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
742.6	Yeah mm mm you can do like you can measure and you can do but he's mm basically doing some mm likelihood ratio testing . So if so the main idea is like suppose you have uh one segment , so he's trying to find the stationality cautious stationality of that segment . 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
800.88	No , you can use mol yeah . No , mainly because of uh M_F_C_C_ computation , because yeah , it becomes really noisy , like if you s yeah , ten milliseconds means you have only eighty samples for uh and then you have refused twenty four filters , the filters won't get any samples , so . 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mol]
919.25	So this shift will suppose if you find one segment of sixty milliseconds , and then you're doing this ten millisecond so every almost I think yeah , mm uh yeah , five frames y you're analysing the previ this already segment so . So again , this may blur some frequency transitions or yeah , but the problem is again this uh bottleneck is here , like you can't change your Nyquist frequency modulation and 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1020.6	No , that's that like he assumes yeah , sixty milliseconds or something he start with , so so then he can yeah , yeah . Yeah , then he can split that window at point N_ say point N_ , so then you will have gyro two no , you can segment it maybe . 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[N]
1043.57	Yeah , so yes , he's supposed this is your p window . So then you can move your like this . You can move your point , so that then this will be like one and this will be second . But again , he assumes some initial uh sizes for these windows . 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1113.89	No , the point is depending on the likelihood ratio . So he got so he supposed this so this is suppose se segment one , and this is segment two . So he compute this error here . So and then he p gives some kind of in terms of this residual letter . So this residual letter is for full gyro samples . Then there would be suppose this point is say N_ . So gyro to N_ and then like 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1178.37	So residual power he can compare t so he after do after doing L_P_ he can get a l residual and then he can compare the power of the residual . So that he's proving that power is again maximum likelihood estimate of your L_P_ parameters . So that which interesting it's you don't really need to do a lot of computation , you just need to take the error of n uh residual of this full window and then residual of energy of the sub-windows and then you can just divide them and then the only thing is like again he has to use some threshold to decide , that that's only the p problem . 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_P, _, L_P]
1274.67	Yeah , this is yeah , I understand . This is this is the actually basically some theoretical proof , like maybe if you want threshold you can see and he's coding from uh Leven like uh . No , this is from again yeah , statistical signal processing . What they say here is like suppose if you analyse two distinct or uh this L_P_ analysis in the same stationary analysis window , the coding will always be greater than the ones resulting from this analysis in two windows . Two stationary windows . 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Leven, L_P]
1399.04	Power is again like yeah yeah yeah yeah , it's time like yeah . It's okay like samples , or you can see root mean square energy or something . 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1741.13	Yeah , especially features , like suppose if somebody come with different good features , again people st again use M_F_C_C_s 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[st, M_F_C_C_s]
1908.03	No no , for s nay , speech synthesis it's like they give you some data , so whether like you use for training or l you can you can do like data driven or like model based approach or whatever like . At the end then they will ask you to synthesise some sentence and you have to synthesise them and then you have to send them 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s, nay]
1933.76	Evaluate it's again subject to s uh because for speech synthes yeah . Yeah , listen and yeah d yeah , even uh they it's mostly they use native speakers only , because they can really judge well , so . 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1985.73	Text to speech . But uh I heard like even for I_CASSP next year there is some com uh like computation by Martin Krug , Sheffield , and on this feature extraction stuff and so at least if you make task simple focus , then it may be good to compare these features and but if you s use some uh large vocabulary system , it takes t six months to build and at the end you don't know whether your features are really uh so . So maybe that's for like people are always using P_L_P_s or M_F_C_C_s , it's it's such a b like lot of time involved , so you can't really check many thi 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[next, year, t, six, months]	[Sheffield]	[Martin, Krug, P_L_P_s, M_F_C_C_s]
2088.13	No , but test set is digits , your m main task is digits k yeah , that's uh like but O_G_I_ numbers are there like now we're little bit convulsed , like we're using twenty seven phones and before it was like twenty four , twenty five . But it's better , like once you have like whatever the back end , then you can put features like whether they're gammas or like spectral entropies or M_F_C_C_s or whatever . Then at least you can see 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[k, O_G_I, _, gammas, M_F_C_C_s]
2165.01	Yeah , at least I mean wha those studies I think people already did for even in I_C_ I_C_S_L_P_ two thousand two there is special session on features for Aurora , so yeah , yeah , i yeah yeah . This ICSI features and this uh s uh s uh O_G_I_ features and all this . So there are already people but again like uh , at the end like for L_V_C_S_R_ people are using P_L_P_s or M_F_C_C_s or nothing of these fancy feature 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[two, thousand, two]	[]	[I_C, _, I_C_S_L_P, Aurora, ICSI, s, O_G_I, _, L_V_C_S_R, _, P_L_P_s, M_F_C_C_s]

2832.68	Yeah , you can download , now . Yeah , yeah yeah . It the voices are called Multisyn , Multisyn uh sl uh that's some voice . So you can download from the voice from the web Festival . 	IN1012.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Multisyn]	[Multisyn, Festival]
2873.81	so this is again like uh that's kind of my P_H_D_ work how in this system like how you choose the units and how you concatenate . So there are again cost functions and Viterbi . So you can you can always optimise , you can put some thresholds and pruning and then you can make it real time . So then again , compromise uh between the quality and yeah .

1655.36	We can always improve , yes . 	IS1009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
235.98	'Cause meetings is a lit different from normal text or a n a normal dialogue or monologue . So interactivity is a concept is a concept that I'm using to distinguish the two uh uh extremes of uh of interac uh of discourse in meetings . And uh for dialogues uh and monologues I think we might have to use different uh concepts to m m uh model the discourse structure . Then uh I w I will uh give a very uh rough plan for the next uh couple of month . And finally I I will intr i introduce some related work , yeah . So 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
593.01	Uh yeah . Uh so for interactivity this is the only slide . So yeah activity is uh I'd define interactivity to be as a degrees of interaction in meetings . So which might uh speak change whi uh uh would be a very good indicator , yeah . 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[whi]
617.74	No , no . Yeah . No yeah . So actually , so uh this is a very rough idea of interactivity . If we go further , we might distinguish uh the interactivity between two , f three , or all the groups . So that might be some final definition for the uh interactivity , yeah . 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
700.25	Okay . So for that case , yeah uh yeah , so this might be a weak definition of interactivity . So if we could figure out uh if they are really interacti uh interacting with each other , or just uh uh incremental mm presentation of some information . So that's d uh different . We might um yeah need a more strict or finer uh definition of interactivity . Yeah , ju uh for this use of the uh for the use of this term for the indicator of the uh degrees of interaction , uh I think for for the current uh proposal I think that it's just for distinguish between dialogues and monologues . 'Cause for these two types of discourse , uh the uh 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ju]
1490.29	So yeah , for interactivity this is a very weak definition , yeah . If we need more then we might use some more finer uh f finer uh definition for interactivity . 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
1642.21	but uh in these two strands or work they uh just come up with a list , maybe not uh exhaustive . So uh I'm been think about uh if we could come up with some kind of more principal scheme uh taking some of the uh information in the uh uh uh in the uh interaction uh into account . Like uh is the small part of interaction is is exchanging some information . 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1770.98	Yeah . But uh that might b be some difference inter interaction par patterns . Might be . 'Cause uh for information if we uh somebody's uh seeking some information , then he uh ask some question and uh the one knows will uh gives gives the answer . But uh uh for the uh opinion or thought uh stuff , then the speaker might just uh uh present some idea and others will comment or uh challenge uh the idea . 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2006.8	Mm 'cause uh from my previous experience we see ananys analysis of information seeking dialogues over telephones . So it's um uh about the tourism information . So from uh um my analysis of that kind of dialogues I could say that there's only there only four basic uh exchanges depend on the information uh direction of the information flow , and also the speaker role . 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2457.75	So we're going to do something and uh uh so could you do something or this kind of uh action related utterance I mean . Yeah . 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2487.35	Before come up with the scheme , you mean . Yeah . 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2573.07	Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Y yeah , look uh not very much detail , yeah . 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
3924.7	Uh uh yeah . Uh I mean I was supposed to chunk uh some part of the AMI meetings , you know , to see if the chunker channel switchboard works well enough or not . If not , then mm we have to use some kind of semi-superv supervised learning or some uh boot-strapping to to to do the chunking . 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[AMI]
5251.59	I will try my best , yeah . 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
5255.6	Oh yeah . Uh I m I might yeah , 'cause uh Julie and the boy is here . So . it's a little tiring 'cause my parents have left . Uh yeah . So I might take two weeks off two weeks off in uh May , yeah , sometimes , yeah . Off , yeah . Okay , thanks . 	EN2005a.A.words.xml	True	[two, weeks, two, weeks]	[]	[Julie, May]
292.95	Yeah , uh so let's perhaps uh in the meantime talk about the um um numbers we assign to the dialogue acts because um yeah , I didn't know that you left out those who don't have words . So I just extracted the actual dialogue numbers , and the problem is um it's perhaps more um dangerous to get mistaken with all those numbers and not knowing why things happen if we just devote numbers and n make new uh n n 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
997.86	But we'll also have to write the the thing in that time . 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1127.31	Yeah , it would buy us something . 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2056.85	And um for the longer utterances I just um look how often um one of these words is in there and simply add it up . So that should in principle favour longer utterances . Um and , yeah , and so these numbers here , um one or zero , these here , um that's um 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2187.49	Yeah . Yeah . Right . So it looks quite good , I think . Um so that's what I got for agreement . Then for disagreement I did also , but um it's a bit more difficult because there's so little disagreement . Yeah , so there you s again see the list . But it's much shorter and it's mu much worse . Smilies . 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2245.82	Or think . I think . Uh yeah . Think is also rated higher in the non-agreement than in the agreement . I mean there is some funny things . 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2265.69	Yeah , it's just I mean it's it's exactly this thing , but just I would I would just have to re-scale this factor here . And I mean this is the dialogue act number . So 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2282.01	Yeah , I can just give it to you in the format you want . So it w it will just k 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2413.2	Yeah . So and I th my my hypothesis was that if it's really yeah , uh like agreement , it will sound different than if it than into if it is just a back-channel . 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2501.29	Yeah , but we would throw a lot away that are quite good . 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2506.32	If you if you would set it off . 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2943.69	Okay , then you you will provide a file with all the mappings from the old ones to the 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3398.79	Yeah , I mean if you if you if you present the components of what it it's based on , then you will need more than twenty minutes to present it , I guess . It's question . 	EN2001e.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
79.32	Okay . Well , could you um put my slides up 'cause I think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time . 	IS1009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
120.69	Cause that's where m my discussion starts . Right well um since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it . Um I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason I just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions . You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your C_D_ whatever you want it to do um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility . 	IS1009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
213.64	Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it's , gee I just gotta have that . And take out their wallet and buy it . So it's gotta be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by September , 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around , isn't gonna sell for Christmas . Um and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . 	IS1009b.D.words.xml	True	[September, September, Christmas]	[]	[Euros, User, Interface]
479.65	Okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . That is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase . Uh because once there's no be-back , well in sales they always say you know , be-backs don't come back . If somebody says , oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead . They're never gonna come back and buy it . You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing . 	IS1009b.D.words.xml	True	[next, week]	[]	[]
510.54	And , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use . We have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that's why I'm saying , simplicity is good . Finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it . So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros . So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that . Has to be so great that they're gonna say , uh twenty five Euros isn't much . Um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . Okay that's uh about it for me right now . 	IS1009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
891.44	Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of silly for children or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is . 	IS1009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1697.62	You can make a banana shaped one . 	IS1009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1985.06	Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um 	IS1009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
46.83	Yeah , now I'd say if for the prototype if we just like wherever possible p chunk in the stuff that we have um pre-annotated and stuff , and for the stuff that we don't have pre-annotated write like a stupid baseline , then we should probably be able to basically that means we focus on on the interface first sort of , so that we we take the the ready-made parts and just see how we get them work together in the interface the way we want and and then we have a working prototype . And then we can go back and replace pieces either by our own components or by more sophisticated compo po components of our own . So it's probably feasible . The thing is I'm away this weekend . So that's for me 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[this, weekend]	[]	[]
93.23	Oh yeah , um yeah . No . But also I might like the the similarity thing , like my just my matrix itself for my stuff , I c I I think I can do that fairly quickly because I have the algorithms . Yeah , I think today's meeting is really the one where we where we sort of settle down the data structure and as soon as we have that , uh probably like after today's meeting , we then actually need to 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[today, today]	[]	[]
114.6	well go back first of all and look at NITE X_M_L_ to see in how far that that which we want is compatible with that which NITE X_M_L_ offers us . And then just sort of everyone make sure everyone understand the interface . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[NITE, X_M_L, _, NITE, X_M_L]
316.12	Well some parts relevant for the search , yes . I'd say so . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
348.82	And for all together , like the display itself , I think we are easier if we if it's sitting on the X_M_L_ than if it's sitting on the S_Q_L_ stuff , because if it's sitting on the X_M_L_ , we have the the NITE X_M_L_ framework with all its functionality for synchronizing through all the different levels whenever there's a change , whenever something's moving forward and stuff . And we can just more or less look at their code , like how their player moves forward , and how that moving forward is represented in different windows and stuff . So I think in the actual browser itself I don't wanna sit on the S_Q_L_ if we can sit on the X_M_L_ because sitting on the X_M_L_ we have all we have so much help . And for y for like the p the calculations that we're doing apart from the search , it seems that everyone needs some special representations anyway . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L, X_M_L, _, NITE, X_M_L, _, X_M_L, _, X_M_L, y]
411.68	What I'm like what we have to think about is if we go with this multi-level idea , like this idea that sort of if you start with a whole meeting series as one entity , as one thing that you display , as one whole sort of , that then the individual chunks of the individual meetings , whereas and then you can click on a meeting , and then sort of the meeting is the whole thing and the chunks are the individual segments , that means sort of we have multiple levels of of representation , which we probably 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
538.68	And just have different like fine-grainedness levels sort of . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
551.8	'Kay . So the only thing that yeah , so the only thing that would happen basically if I double-click let's say from the whole meeting series on a single meeting , is that the zoom level changes . Like the th the start and the end position changes and the zoom level changes . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
703.9	We I think we have start and end times for words actually , but it's yeah , but it m it might s but it might sound crazy in the player . We should really maybe we can do that together at some point today that we check out how the player works . But there's maybe some merit in altogether doing it on an utterance level in the end . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
931.27	Well we do a pre-filtering of sort of the whole thing , sort of like but that , like the problem with that is it's easy to do in the text level . But that would mean it would still play the uh in your audio , unless we sort of also store what pieces we cut out for the audio . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1032.14	Yeah , maybe even I mean that's sort of that depends on how how advanced we get . If maybe if we realise that there's massive differences in in gain or in something , you can probably just make some simple simple normalization , but that really depends on how much time we have and and how much is necessary . Yeah , if like I d I don't know anything about audio and I have never seen the player . So if you find that the player accepts some n input from memory , and if it's easy to do , then I guess that's that's fairly doable . So but that means in the general structure we're actually quite lucky , so we we have we load into memory for the whole series of meetings just the utterances and rankings for the utterances and some information probably that says , well , the I guess that goes with the utterance , who's speaking . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1073.53	Because then we can also do the display about who's speaking . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1120.12	We do get an error message with the project if we load everything into the project with all the data they load . So we know that doesn't work . So our hope is essentially that we load less into it . What's this lazy loading thing , somebody explain lazy loading to me . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1204.44	Let's check that out . Um I'll p I'll probably ask Jonathan about it . So alternatively , if we realise we can't do the whole thing in one go , we can probably just process some sort of meta-data , you know what I mean , like sort of sort of for the whole series 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Jonathan]
1281.72	Yeah , sort of like off-line create a virtual meeting , which which basically treats the meeting series as if it was a meeting , and treats the individual meetings within the series as if they were segments , and treats the individual segments within meetings as if they were um utterances . You know , so we just sort of we shift it one level up . And in that way we could probably use the same algorithm and just like make vir like one or two ifs that say okay , if you are on a whole document uh a whole series level and that was a double-click , then don't just go into that um segment , but load a new file or something like it , but in general use the same algorithm . That would be an alternative if we can't actually load the whole thing and 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1389.35	Yeah . Yeah , and if you make that structurally very similar to the the le like one level down , like the way how we uh store individual utterances and stuff , then maybe we can more or less use the same code and just make a few ifs and stuff . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1442.39	so the skimming can work on that because the skimming just sort of sorts the utterances and puts as many in as it needs 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1454.23	Yeah . Yeah , it'll it'll play them in some order in which they were set because otherwise it's gonna be more entertaining . Um 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1505.19	Yeah , and then you sort of feed the time stamp to and the NITE X_M_L_ central manager , and that central manager alerts everything that's there , like alerts the skim like the the audio display , alerts the text display , alerts the visual display and says we have a new time frame and then they all sort of do their update routines with respect to the current level of zoom . So how much do they display , and starting position at where the or maybe the mid-position of it , I don't know , like w if start where the thing was found or if that thing wa was found it's in the middle of the part that we display , that I don't know . But that we can decide about , but a general sort of 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[NITE, X_M_L, _]
1711.4	Oh . That's just so like to make a list of all this stuff , or we probably can somebody can do it on paper . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1896.02	So if this lazy loading works , then this should definitely fit into I mean not memory then because it wouldn't all be in memory at the same time . So if we just have those sort of that information like a long list of all the utterances slash segments and like short or smaller lists which give weight to them . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1916.15	And even though probably if there's a lot of over-head in having two different files , we can probably merge the weights into it off-line . You know what I mean , like if if there's a lot of bureaucracy involved with having two different trees and whether one ties to the other because the one has the weight for the other , then it's probably quicker to just 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1966.21	then it would probably be for us easy to just like off-line put the the weight into into the file that has the segments , uh yeah , segments slash utterances already . But that we can figure out I mean if it's going horrendously wrong . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2108.64	When do we need the one for the meet 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2179.43	Also like for this part , maybe if we go over it with named entity in the end , if I mean w if one of the people doing DIL has some named entity code to spare , and just like at least for the for sort of for finding topics , titles for for segments , just take a named entity which has a really high , what's it called , D_F_I_D_F_ , whatever . 'Cause you'd probably be quite likely if they're talking about a conference or a person , that that would be a named entity which is very highly fr um frequented in that part . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_F_I_D_F, fr]
2312.58	Yeah , that would mean understanding the NITE X_M_L_ X_M_L_ sort of format in a lot more detail . We should I think we should just have a long session in the computer room together and like now that we know a bit more what we want , take a closer look at NITE X_M_L_ . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[NITE, X_M_L, X_M_L, _, NITE, X_M_L, _]
2514.75	Or just adapt like their like just sort of go from their system and and adapt that piece for piece and see how we could 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2522.48	how we could arran like adapt it to our 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2590.5	Okay , so I'll just meet you in in eighteen a in the afternoon . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[eighteen]	[]	[]
3001.38	Be careful with that . Like my experience with the British National Corpus was that there's far more word types than you ever think because anything that's sort of unusual generally is a new word type . Like any typo or any strange thing where they put two words together . And also any number as a word type of its own . So you can easily end up with hundred thousands of words when you didn't expect them . So generally dictionaries can grow bigger then you think they do . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[British, National, Corpus]
3030.57	Well you can probably also you can probably pre-filter like with regular expressions even just say if it consists of only dig digits , then skip it , or even if it consists any special characters , then skip it because it's probably something with a dot in between , which is usually not something you wanna have and 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[dig]
3099.72	Frequencies . Yeah . Well I guess as soon as we have the raw text , we can probably just start with the Java hash map and like just hash map over it and see how far we get . I mean we can probably on a machine with a few hundred megabyte RAM you can go quite far . You can write it on beefy . So even if it goes wrong and even if it has a million words be 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Java]
3151.88	Yeah , if you if you enter the big room , in the right-hand corner , I think . Um the thing is like you can only burn from the local file-system . So if it's from s well actually I think if it's mounted , you can directly burn from there , but the problem is I have my data on beefy and so I have to get it into the local temp directory and burn it from there . But you can burn it from there . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
3197.54	See I would off I would offer you to to get it on this one , and then um like copy it . But you know what I figured out , I'm quicker down-loading over broad-band into my computer than using this hard disk . There's something strange about the way how they access the hard disk , how they mount it , which is unfortunate . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3266.18	Ah yeah , but that would have to be the temp directory off the machine you can S_S_H_ into directory of S_S_H_ . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, S_S_H, _]
3289.81	They'd probably they'd like you more if you S_S_H_ uh into another computer , compress it there and then sort of copy it into the into the gateway machine . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3388.85	As soon as somebody gives me the raw text of the whole thing , I can probably just implement like a five line Java hash table frequency dictionary builder and see 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Java]
3422.64	Yeah , you'd have to count it yourself , yeah . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3582.36	Oh , so that's what f Rainbow does , because that's what L_S_A_ builds on . Like it builds a f a document by frequency matrix . So I could probably get that . Even though but I already have I already have my code to build it up myself . No , don't bother . I have my code already . Um 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f, Rainbow, f]
3720.47	Because if we're doing Like I think for for the information density we uh we should calculate it on the lowest level , not on the highest . But like 'cause 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3947.32	So sorry , could describe that again , the 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4163.39	Well we alternatively we can probably just make another directory on the beefy scratch space . I mean that's where I'm having gigabytes and gigabytes of stuff at the moment . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4361.73	Wait , wait , wait . Um sorry . Yeah , sorry . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4371.94	What I just realised , we should really t keep different serieses completely separate for virtually all purposes . Just let's be careful about that , because 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4403.29	Okay , but like let's just be careful that whatever we sort of we merge together , that like the highest level of merging , it's not the whole ICSI corpus but individual series . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ICSI, corpus]
4417.28	I think we might actually I think That's probably be somewhere like well or something like it . Um I think we might just get away with for the whole project just like looking at only one series and just doing within one series . I mean you can do everything you want in one series . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4437.28	Oh yeah , let's take that . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4461.15	Okay . So at at every level everyone has to be careful to really just take even at the highest level , just take stuff from one series and not merge stuff from different series together because they would probably be just majorly messy . Yeah , so so t so like if even if we make one single text file which has the whole corpus , sort of our corpus , that would still be from one series only . Wou but it what you're producing at the moment is like individual text files that sort of have the raw text for a whole a meeting as a whole or 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Wou]
4592.0	Okay . You're gonna put that as an output of yours , the segmentation . Okay , so for now can you create like sort of just uh a dump which is pure text , just pure text so that I can get a dictionary and you can work on that for your topic segmentation . And 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4612.16	Or for for the series . But I can but I can also deal with separate files , I mean I can just write the algorithm that it loads all files in a directory or something . But I mean if you 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[algorithm]
4639.65	Yeah . So give m give me different files as long as like it m if you could name them in a way that is easy to enumerate over them , like whatever , one two three four five or something . Or just anything that I can 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4721.7	Okay , cool . 'Cause I'll need that then when it's done . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4826.63	So I'll create a dictionary . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4838.44	Add add the structure , yeah . And then the actual file we can probably like copy from your home directory or something like it . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4961.64	Yeah . I I'll I'll check if I understand how it works . I mean otherwise I can give you the code for loading a dictionary . Give you my my it's just it's it's sort of it's a line break separated file , you know . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4982.62	Yeah , I'll see if I understand how to serialize . There's a there's a serialise command so that gives me one mega mother of a s 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4994.71	Yeah , but do they automatically write to the file anyway I'll I'll figure that out . We don't have to 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
5026.35	I'll build a dictionary as soon as I get the text . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
5074.84	Mm-hmm . Ah well , let's go . Sorry . 	EN2001a.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
647.17	So when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this . 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
775.03	Let's delegate . 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
817.97	You can even have them in different flavours as well . So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , yeah . Scratch and sniff . 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1280.39	You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . So so mine's a bit pointless . 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1402.1	um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1445.25	a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1460.69	Sky or cable one does . Like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[the, next, half, hour]	[]	[]
1487.57	um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . So 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1550.27	And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . If we're k trying to keep it 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sky, k]
1642.86	But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1688.34	on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . Yeah , see where the mouse is , like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1698.85	And enter in the middle , so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that . I'm getting a bit uh specific here . Really we'd have to use something to show you , but 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1792.99	Look at look at this one . 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1799.68	Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose . Might take up your whole living room . 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1864.0	uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2043.62	But it does depend how much 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2060.04	Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_ . 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
2191.11	Yeah . Well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them , and 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
2220.81	Just copy the one on the left . No um a scroll 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2227.67	Well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2237.06	Yeah , I'd like push buttons with 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2241.8	So push buttons 	ES2013c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
398.61	Dude you're a good drawer . 	TS3006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
429.14	They kind of l look like mole legs . With sharp nails on . 	TS3006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
570.73	Excuse my language . 	TS3006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
700.13	Well I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . So I had to uh , I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , and kind of let it work in to get ideas about 	TS3006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1048.15	Yeah okay . We'll do our best . 	TS3006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1122.84	Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , so I kind of need to know what we uh need . 	TS3006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ne]
1146.98	Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh 	TS3006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1150.93	in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh 	TS3006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1206.88	See you later . 	TS3006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
337.4	then we we could use it . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
407.73	You can see the buttons better , of course . Yeah . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
501.4	So , just move to the next slide . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
514.31	So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
537.99	Yeah . Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
570.0	So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
597.3	you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
645.17	Yeah , this is just the the wheel . We could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
654.19	Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
817.21	You can throw it to the television . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
821.58	Hey that's a cool one . We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
940.86	You can make it um 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1037.3	You can put also vibrator inside . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1044.05	Ah-ha . You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . Yeah . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1195.89	Yeah but okay . Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb . Basically . Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . 	IS1001c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
115.99	Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside . So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
166.1	I'll give comments . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
271.89	Yeah , you can put 'em all on the back . That's for sure . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
289.13	You Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So But it's enough room . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
327.67	will uh will show up . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
374.92	I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
400.68	Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
409.39	Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
488.04	You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough . If that breaks then you're screwed . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
516.48	scroll in the , navigate the menu . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
525.15	I think we can even put a We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels . So you have one left for the Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Play, Station]
584.53	Mm where do we have 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
762.01	So yeah . Um do we need to fix that or 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
816.13	I think just on the buttons . If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1117.68	Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up . So you can see what's really there . Not just not re on the buttons or something . Just a green light or some blue light . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1129.64	To light it all up . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1498.65	This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1508.23	To call . Um 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1762.07	check the time , etcetera . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2035.35	Oh , what do we have to do now . Do we uh 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2052.77	Mm we can do it afterwards , so 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2229.24	Yeah , and touch screens for all our stuff , yeah . I do agree with that . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2343.14	Come on . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2377.0	We'll see . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2422.88	I'll put it here . You are going to put it there . Then 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2459.27	Then do it correctly . 	TS3004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]

65.17	Yeah , and have this discussion every two years . 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[two, years]	[]	[]
74.06	make sense for everyone . So we can choose where to put uh , I would say , the the the three first one of the list . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . And yeah . 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
133.4	can switch . 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
157.69	So we need to put Pirette , Andrei and Nancy do we want to the the question is now is do we want to put the three together or the three completely separate 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pirette, Andrei, Nancy]
249.2	Yeah , but you I mean uh I think , everybody is supposed to spend more time in their office than in the reading room . So we might think that it's better to have a more comfortable office than a more comfortable reading room , I don't know , it change the plan of the morning , I'm sorry , but I just realised that stupid architect put only one windows . 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
297.53	Yeah , you too , I can I can say the thing to you , I'm sorry . 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
460.77	So and can you put the the map again , so we s see what happen . 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
596.96	Yeah . And we might put Martin and Andrei and someone else in the three person room , since the fifty per cent , it's a good 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Martin, Andrei]
956.42	to change a little bit this disadvantage we put somebody fifty per cent , in 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
960.95	three person room , so we could do the same in the three person rooms , but there is still this problem yeah . 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1034.01	You can move with your desktop , yeah . 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1061.4	Okay , can we say that David uh is yeah . Instead of 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[David]
1077.93	Keep this office for reception people . 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1118.08	You know what I mean . Yeah , to find us and it's also quite noisy when you have this kind of 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1529.88	And since you nee you will meet the administrator , can we ask for a coffee machine somewhere . Yeah , or in that hall . I mean , the sixth floor , there is no coffee machine on the sixth floor . 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1557.08	Yeah but try . 	IB4002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
86.78	Uh there we go , just screw 'em on in . Gonna have to swap them round so now , it was function F_ eight . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F, _]
106.71	Should do it , good one . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
127.14	Hold on , sorry . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
560.84	Um , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F, _, escape'll]
639.59	That can come under Arlo as well . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Arlo]
659.74	Uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
917.08	Let's remember that . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
973.62	But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1048.1	Well that's cool . If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1254.23	'Kay , thank you very much , um I'll take that back . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
1292.12	We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . Um , dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind . Um it's only for the television , which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television , and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[teletext, Oracle]
1389.61	we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read . We'll use the the basic functions for a television . No teletext . Um okay hold on . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1416.6	I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1424.26	Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they'll send 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1429.87	some information about that , about um what people , whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control . Okay um . So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . However that does sound a bit like the 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Arlo, _]
1603.49	Yeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, one'll]
1669.79	That we should just stick on , yeah . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1714.7	Yeah . It might do us out of a job . Um 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1765.0	you might have trouble incorporating the screen . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1790.96	Contrast contra well . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1811.17	Okay , well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , um if we're gonna have to if we're gonna have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our um 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1824.1	slogan . Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1918.15	So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1942.0	Uh you were finding out about teletext . If you could find out that uh 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2016.47	Uh o okay . And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
2023.99	Okay , so . Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . So , it just helps me summarize them . And um I'll put any I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , so uh 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2049.28	A_M_I_ scenario controller . 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2078.76	And I will tr getting strings of um information , I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as I get them now , rather than I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so 	ES2005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
180.12	uh . So w it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that 	IS1005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
237.71	Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project . So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here . So uh . For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it . 	IS1005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
310.27	So I will ask you all to do the same . Just to get used to the whiteboard . 	IS1005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
325.0	Yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course . 	IS1005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
541.96	You can draw it , if you want . 	IS1005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
609.11	So good um So , let's talk about money . Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro . And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro . 	IS1005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro, Euro, Euro]
866.25	Okay . Let's continue . I have a meeting in five minutes , so maybe we should hurry . Um . So we will close uh this meeting . So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes . 	IS1005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
888.95	Uh . The So I will ask you to do some work . Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and 	IS1005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
905.73	read about Yeah . 	IS1005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
959.72	Um , you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach . 	IS1005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
374.79	But to get a cluster the location that is uh a place where uh noise is regularly coming from . 	IN1009.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
777.42	Professor was interested to know when people were talking about him . Ah , someone is talking about me , let's listen . 	IN1009.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Professor]
1030.61	For the first application we will do with uh prototypes , it will be more about quantity uh of speech or how long , how much someone speak , but when we will go to final uh details , if I'm talking and someone say yes yes yes from time to time , it show that he's participating , and obviously it makes different that if someone is talking and one is replying never uh nor moving or nor having eyes open 	IN1009.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1074.78	Go through them . 	IN1009.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1096.4	Try . 	IN1009.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
770.31	So do we have to be realistic within the budget or 	ES2007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
831.25	Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example . I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated . 	ES2007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[V_C_R]
864.42	No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but 	ES2007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
890.57	Start breaking up . 	ES2007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1164.78	Do you think our two kind of overlap , because 	ES2007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
149.98	Ah . She . You can look at the final report , 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
178.35	Yeah . Here we go again . Welcome . Uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh f the remote control has to support . So who wants go . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
513.18	Calculator's can do it . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1057.81	Oh okay . I see . Yeah also like this . So you can hold it . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1168.93	Well we could make a compromise between that . But I don't know if it's worth the effort . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1182.29	So to appeal a little more to the all the public . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1208.12	Yeah I'd agree . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1270.14	can turn it maybe . To switch from buttons to interface hmm . If you turn it a little . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1283.08	Oh yeah . Least you can easily see it . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1315.98	If you can uh flip . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1338.91	make this 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1435.43	Yeah . So it can bounce . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1480.1	Maybe can design two versions . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1640.59	You could also make line with uh Yeah . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1737.75	And then you can use yellow or semething . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1914.8	You can make them red . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1951.11	change the colour so 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2008.86	You will do the evaluation . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2029.98	Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . I don't know . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2051.36	Look-and-feel and 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2077.39	show to the management . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2091.78	Oh and save this uh board . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2095.41	Just save it . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2108.64	You can also include clip-art . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2112.44	So if you'll rather draw in paint or something 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2127.73	then look . Yeah . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2144.42	Yeah . You can also include it . It's not much work . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2397.28	Keep the flip live . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2517.47	So maybe you can include that somewhere . 	TS3006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
126.64	Um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see . Yeah . 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
329.9	Say it for the camera . 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
349.63	Just let it lie down , it wont stand . 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
486.98	Okay . Well we can work around that um 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
492.43	Cut things out . 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
529.53	We should fire the accountants . 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
532.85	Fire the accountants . 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
540.15	Ah yeah , we could add things . 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
738.44	Uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this , right . 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
752.72	Uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay . 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1349.01	Yeah round it up to two . So trends . 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1404.88	'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
1564.42	I'll go with two . 	ES2005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
97.56	Okay . Um , do I need to plugged in . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
122.15	Okay . I will take this time just to apologise . I , I only , uh , received my emails later on . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . But there we go . Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
169.16	Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . Um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um Genevieve's idea . So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . A automatically , um lights up at first touch . Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Genevieve]
210.27	Um , also we could use um an alarm . So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . Um , so that would work . Um , oop . Go back there . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
234.09	Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
270.63	So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
321.62	Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
381.15	You could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . For a certain percentage at least . Not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , but 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
466.11	There we go . Sorry , should I go back . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
468.89	This would actually show the circuit diagram . Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet . So I just put all those components in . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1142.89	To get the right reception and picture , I suppose . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1390.73	teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1669.75	Okay . Work on that . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1802.54	Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . Like you just a , a buzz or something . Yeah . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1821.25	If Do you mean the the link between the Well , if the button was actually on 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1862.91	Pr probably . Unless it could be Okay . Um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . I mean the power for the T_V_ . So , mm , more research into that one . Yeah . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, T_V]
2122.29	Yeah , and we could Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , which could like link in with the company colours . Like it could be blue or green or yellow , or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2200.51	Okay . Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something . Yeah , or Okay . 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2235.82	And also possible I mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
2269.92	Okay . Let's 	ES2015b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
0.07	Hey look , these are microphones they uh they're for women's shirts . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
9.88	Um okay , so um let's start . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
172.31	Yeah , I think , yeah . It it's more a matter of how to arrange the furniture , but uh since we are experts at this task uh okay , so maybe we could count on on four places , but the final decision is not really ours , so uh we'll see actually this 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
235.43	Beautiful . Okay , then let me um explain very briefly the the rationale for for this . So it's the same uh schema that you know . In red you have the uh uh oh , excuse me , that's quite uh annoying , excuse me . Um hello . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
256.57	Oh , yeah , um , can I can I call you a bit later in about half an hour . I'm just in the middle of a meeting and I'm talking . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
264.32	Oh okay , thank you . Bye-bye . Um , sorry for this . Fortunately we were just uh the four of us . Um . Okay , so , let me get back to into the proposal after the brief interruption . Um so the names are in red . Now um well , one of the reasons at least for me for doing this was to more or less group people uh with within projects , because I I think that sometimes they ju they just discuss together and uh it's easier if they are in the same office . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bye]
370.36	Yeah , we'll have to check tha yeah , but the printer is quite small if we fi find just a small table for it . maybe one day we'll have a photocopy that is also a printer . So okay , but uh I wouldn't well insist on this I think okay , so the printer , well , we'll remove it if we work from this uh this solution . So uh I_M_two is more or less in the upper left side . Um I said more or less um uh upper uh lower left side uh you have SwissTra and , so the two projects from the list . And then on the on the right side . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[one, day]	[]	[SwissTra]
502.31	Yeah , we could store files there and things like that . Mm-hmm . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
510.37	Okay , so if you want I can already do this change here . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
554.56	So maybe I would suggest let me le k can I hear also let us hear from you . And then if we can work out a solu a common solution from this one , then we go back to to this slide . And if not , um we'll just , well start from scratch . Um . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[k]
586.9	Yeah , I'll try . I'll bring my walkman and uh 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
626.75	Uh-huh . Oh let me put the plan , sorry . I will display uh yeah , this is the empty one . I don't want to influence you . So so you would put uh 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
642.75	Mm-hmm . you can you can even stand and just show us there . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
650.82	Okay , so we would prefer the names . Okay I I don't want to influence you too much , but uh mm I'm perfectly happy to start with this as the basis and then change things . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
844.98	Yeah , that's true . That's true . I um so we could put Nancy with David and uh put Agnes yeah . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nancy, David, Agnes]
963.98	First one should be Maria , but it's still uh one and a half . Okay , let's switch uh 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Maria]
1010.85	Yeah , so s s okay so since we are supposed to do a final proposal . Sorry , uh let me move the printer um next to the photocopier . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1025.28	Okay . And we'll find some way to um , well , attach it to a wall or something like this . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1130.11	Okay , let's be innovative . Um . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1223.07	So you would like to put it , yeah , within yeah , and then who who yeah . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1232.88	Yeah . Yeah okay , but then that means that we'll put the lounge on the right side , uh here . And uh here we'll put two places for visitors . Three . But that means the office will be at least for the moment empty . That looks very bad . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1255.96	Okay , so that could take the the free place over there . Uh I mean 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1308.72	No okay , no way . I'll I'll have my head cut off if we don't have a lounge . So uh 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1316.82	No no no no , let's do the lounge corner . Okay . At least . I mean otherwise I cannot really defend it , because it it was agreed and we cannot just come back on every every decision we made . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1339.46	Well , let's have the visitors first . Okay , so what we need is a new and two . So 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1396.82	No no , we'll put a visitor place in there . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1423.0	No , I I would prefer you , I think . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1425.8	Okay , let me keep you . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1430.84	Okay , we'll put Paola and a visitor here . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Paola]	[]
1511.41	Yeah , that's true . Okay , so let's put Maria in the separate office . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Maria]
1560.23	Yeah , but let's split them a little bit , so that when there are no visitors , at least people are 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1602.04	Yeah , okay . Let me call this visitor one , which implies that uh it will be the first one occupied by a visitor when they come . And this visitor two which means it's like a , well , you know , second uh second chance . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1666.61	Yeah , so maybe in the long run we'll get a wall . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1787.04	Yeah , well , we are almost done , Susan , but uh we we'll we'll just check the the items . Yeah , please . Okay . No problem . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Susan]
1796.36	Yeah , we we'll just review the items to see is we look at all the constraints and then you'll be able to say the final uh yes or no . Um . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1840.2	Yeah , that's a bit yeah , that was the point in letting David there and but okay , maybe we'll just leave it as an option . David or visitor one or two . It's uh 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[David, David]
1872.28	Okay . So we'll know that uh that the region actually around here is probably movable . Yeah , either , yeah , we can switch Maria or Paola or David . Yeah . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Paola]	[Maria, David]
1891.17	Yeah , no , exactly . Yeah , tha tha yeah , that's why I always try to put the to separate the visitors , just to balance a little bit . But okay , we'll uh , we'll be open on on that point . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1903.44	Yeah , it will become 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1915.42	Okay , w we'll see . Anyway , we'll we'll be open . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1978.4	Yeah . W we can leave it like this and then 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2026.63	Okay . Yeah , we'll we'll keep it like this . Um okay I , well , I'll try to to express all these constraints and uh and say in particular that the two rooms over here actually are sort of uh , well , s things could be changed over there , but on some other sides 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
2088.26	Uh-huh . A as far as know I think Agnes is also taking care of a proposal so okay , yeah , I'll circulate this . Perfect . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Agnes]
2102.37	Okay , so maybe we'll learn some more constraints . Um okay . Um yeah , actually as I as I told uh Martin um , well , this is the last time we meet , so uh this is , well , more or less our proposal , and uh we'll have a meeting , I think , it's uh it's in two days or something like that . Uh to discuss and compare with the other proposal and uh , well , make a final decision . Actually , probably a pre-final one , since we'll have to check again with everyone . But uh 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[two, days]	[]	[Martin]
2244.2	Uh , normally it's done automatically , except that we'll have to think 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2285.76	Yeah , yeah , I think yeah , i I mean it's a completely different issue from uh , you know , arranging people . It's just uh how the moving will take place . And there are things to to take care of , but uh it's uh quite unrelated with these things . Yeah , we'll get uh we'll get all the information . Uh thinking about internet connections , I think it's quite okay for the the for the the printer to be there . Yeah , I think it's i it's feasible . We'll we'll check . So the the violet box here is uh uh our mailboxes also . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[violet]
2342.26	Mm-hmm . Okay . Well , I think it's a bit off topic already . So um let's say that i it's a proposal . We'll try it I'm , well I'll try to to express the the constraints and uh your opinions and uh well , I think , finally everyone can veto something if there is a huge problem , but I think with this we we don't run into huge problems . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2365.89	Yeah , obviously . So let me save this . 	IB4004.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
296.96	To merge the two system huh . 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
333.64	Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same . So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sh]
414.85	So we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
422.23	to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
434.1	how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . So , this one is leather bu based but 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
488.62	Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside . 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
510.32	You can go to the next slide . I have some kind of pictures 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
538.75	Look . 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
557.55	because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
599.91	You'd yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also . 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
692.46	Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
732.56	Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[g, Graphical, User, Designer]
1098.54	Look fancy . 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1405.35	Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web . 	IS1003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
455.29	Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And we we have therefore in total um 	ES2011d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
482.02	We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um . 	ES2011d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
796.1	We'll just do um 	ES2011d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1223.5	Yeah and just have the colour match or something . 	ES2011d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1327.86	Think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one . . 	ES2011d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1467.83	Do you want this and we can all 	ES2011d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
260.2	Okay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've 	TS3004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Jens, Damman]
308.92	So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . 	TS3004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
325.12	Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . 	TS3004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
336.53	I think this fits uh at the uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . 	TS3004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Michael]
406.67	Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you clap your hands it will beep or something . Uh you must find it uh quickly . 	TS3004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
423.07	Okay , yeah . Yeah , we can uh combine that . Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . It's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent . But it's uh a tough one . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . 	TS3004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
521.42	I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros . Um then 	TS3004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
561.29	Yeah , only only for television uh On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special . 	TS3004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros, mi, mm]
623.22	Yeah , to k to keep it simple when you Sorry I thought about it , yes . 	TS3004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[k]
1093.11	Maybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue or yellow or 	TS3004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1372.64	Oh , I have a modern one . And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it , and then it's okay . 	TS3004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1689.93	Twelve and a half , okay . But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special . So 	TS3004b.D.words.xml	True	[Twelve, and, a, half]	[]	[]
165.16	we need the infra-red transmitter . Get that off the shelf . Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be 	ES2003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
199.52	can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one . 	ES2003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
247.99	We should probably just use conventional batteries . 	ES2003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
315.54	for a curved , well I was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand . Uh maybe like this , with the uh joy pad here . Joystick here . And maybe 	ES2003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
333.28	an okay button around here , so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily . Um I don't exactly 	ES2003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
384.82	and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com P_C_s . Uh but 	ES2003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
532.47	Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control . If you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_ . Uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier . 	ES2003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
564.85	uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh 	ES2003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
618.66	maybe use single curved uh case . 	ES2003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
623.94	Because we might need it to be curved for the uh 	ES2003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
633.33	and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_ . 	ES2003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
8.82	You will see uh 	TS3012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
31.41	A little bit . I uh now will show it . 	TS3012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
685.46	Yeah . Mean of uh seventy percent I think . Uh I'm I have to look it up . 	TS3012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
933.51	No it maybe it's better to look uh what the people want . So I can uh show my uh investigation . 	TS3012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1292.08	But you can make uh if you want to use a fruit in uh in uh 	TS3012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1307.66	You can make it like 	TS3012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1517.06	And speech w recognition . Are we 	TS3012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
727.03	Yeah uh , okay uh , me personally I would like to to to share the other peopl n uh the room with assistants as when you have problems of normal life , like uh the printer doesn't work , uh I don't want to ask this to my supervisor , so it's better to to be with a with an assistant to share the room . 	IB4003.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1265.29	But uh usually , whe when new assistants come , they would like to share the room with someone that knows uh l uh it's related with the project , so he can 	IB4003.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
171.16	No the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . So that indicates our technological advancement . And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . And it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . So that they could know how to use these remote controls . 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ta]
259.33	Y yeah uh yeah , we have to , because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , becoming Yeah . So Yeah . So something like that we we should do . 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y, g]
287.01	And people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . Yeah . Yeah . So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . So that should also be taken into consideration . So these are my views . So 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
808.22	Uh i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
1253.59	Yeah , I appreciate this idea , because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . That what our data shows that , so this w this w 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1347.36	Yeah , then only we can relate it with something . Yeah . Exactly . 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1357.69	Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1591.38	Or we can we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , it will look l Uh yeah . In that w 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1658.22	Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , so half of that will be look the Yeah , not not the upper side . So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . And 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2018.36	Uh excuse me , Bri 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bri]
2026.82	You just touch the pad , yeah . 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2083.58	Uh it was under a different name . I will show you , in shared documents . 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2123.89	I'll show you . 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2177.57	Uh excuse me , Brian . You have to keep your pen separate , because I used your pen . 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Brian]
2258.37	Yeah . Excuse me . 	ES2005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
568.05	Okay , go 	IS1003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
667.77	Have to be really careful . 	IS1003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
567.16	Okay . Um if you all go stand around uh 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
581.25	I uh had uh two examples . Um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . This the easy one I think we have to to combine them . And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples . 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
629.72	Yeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah . We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button . But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option . 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
663.2	Uh yeah the basic functions . Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed . 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
729.46	Um the we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable yeah content and form . Now that that was uh was the end . Yes . 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
912.4	Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[shou]
1059.75	I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display . 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1300.96	And do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1542.45	We we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1997.85	Uh I think we have to to group , to make two groups . Um the one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions , and 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2189.04	So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button . 	TS3006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1232.69	I'd put it at one I think , but I dunno , what do you 	ES2013d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1471.04	Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest . 	ES2013d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1520.1	Yeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , but it depends on the cost , I guess . 	ES2013d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1542.76	Yep . Do we need to say how many buttons , or 	ES2013d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1799.48	Yes . Oh hang on , we haven't heard . 	ES2013d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
291.12	I will give a a five . 	IS1001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
692.4	Start to eat banana . 	IS1001d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
44.08	So let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . So , as the previous meeting I will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
196.19	Okay . Yeah , why not . We'll have big discussion I suppose after that , so . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
301.3	Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
352.17	Yeah , but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . You're not you're not obliged to share it . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
440.92	remote control . We need something that is international . Suppose we're we want to sell it in France . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[France]	[]
551.94	Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . You just want to interact with television . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[li]
572.13	Yeah , but you can lose it . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
587.81	Okay you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
689.05	Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
877.03	Okay . So let's go to the Industrial Designer . Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
1177.8	Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1475.38	So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , maybe will attract 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1542.7	Th The feeling is natural , so maybe we can stay with wood . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1622.28	So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Google]
1728.59	So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1739.92	in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Baba]
1789.81	And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , so you will have to model model something . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Baba, David, Jordan]
1830.18	So , no more questions , we can close the session . 	IS1003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
59.4	Okay . Um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . The meeting will be forty minutes long . And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint . 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Poppy, PowerPoint]
400.16	Um one thing with the scroll buttons though . It , it we would have to have an L_C_D_ um 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
608.71	Okay , we'll just say yeah . Yes , just why not . Alright . I like the kinetic energy source idea . Um , I don't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot . But I think that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[kinetic, kinetic]
626.96	energy source . It could make an we could have any kind of style . It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , and 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
677.9	Yeah , you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then . 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
718.05	Yeah . Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it . 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1062.51	Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look . 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1104.75	If they were white they would glow , probably . If they were made out of rubber . 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1168.57	Well , if they're raised up buttons . So that you can feel them . We were talking about it being more 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1413.66	um , do , according to our plans already , given the market . But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control . 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1486.35	Tone it down . Yeah , like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product . 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1531.97	So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again . 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
1607.47	Does anyone know how to take it out of 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1638.4	I mean will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's , 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1883.85	Yeah . And most televisions will come with a remote . 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1958.9	Crap . Okay , um , let's do this fast . Um 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2030.22	Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay . 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Poppy, Tara]
2035.04	And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen . 	ES2015c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
129.97	No . Yeah . Try the power button . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
226.11	Well , this is the agenda for today . Well , the opening is what I'm doing right now . Uh , we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things . Uh give some um 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
305.64	Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . You can uh um there's a document folder called um the sh shared document folder . You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . We also have the white-board . Uh , we're gonna skip through th 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sh, PowerPoint]
365.78	It's quite simple . You have the the pen function , eraser function . It's like a very simple uh paint application . Uh , we well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . It works like this . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[pu, puttin]
414.2	It's doing some stuff now . So you can use a pen . You can use an eraser . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
421.03	And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
435.8	And then select current colour or line width . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
449.6	Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . Uh , I'll start off then . I'll use this uh same sheet . Alright . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
472.0	Oh , let me think . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
523.84	Think it is . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
620.9	Uh , make a new sheet . Uh , it's by pressing on blank . Yep . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
631.3	And uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
703.66	Well , tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
769.98	I'll do so . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
849.12	Well , you can have a piranha at home . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1072.89	So wha what 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1161.53	original , trendly , and user-friendly Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . No , well something trendy and original , well that that goes hand in hand I guess . When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , or we should make it combination of that . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[al]
1200.74	Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . Well , you know , y like some special feature . Or some Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1215.36	Well , the closing . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Individual , I think so . The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , we will uh 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
1269.23	Yeah , close it . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1298.71	Or we can leave already I guess . or uh or sh or should we uh or is important that we leave at exact uh 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1312.37	We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes . 	TS3008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
0.02	Think we can first 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
150.62	sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . Um right , this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
199.38	Then we're gonna work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it . 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
274.97	Okay , jolly good . Alright , let's have um well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . I think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . So that's gonna be you Catherine , if we wanna hear from you first . 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Catherine]
632.22	Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things . 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Catherine, Gab, Gabriel]
903.97	I would say 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
914.16	which I think it probably should be , even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes , it's like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , but you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ . 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ab, ab, ab, R, _]
1006.76	Okay , fantastic . Right , well done , Gabriel . Um Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby . 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gabriel, Reissa]
1286.55	I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1332.42	Let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[ten, years, ', time]	[]	[]
1344.18	Yeah . They're having a lunch break at the moment , but yeah . I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1383.34	we've decide we've d 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1403.7	Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um . 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bluetooth]
1521.72	Send me , yeah yeah , okay . 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1551.27	Well , see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image . It's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product . 	ES2007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
971.75	Or yeah . Yeah . Yeah , it's good idea . Just give some questions uh 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1255.97	Maybe you can detect breathing . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1261.17	Yeah . Yeah , that you could do . Or on the table uh there should be well . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1534.21	Yeah . Um you can use multiple ones and do some um um triangulation . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1573.51	Yeah , then you might get uh better direction in elevation . But I'm not sure it's really relevant . Um no . So 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1607.3	With one you will only get direction . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1803.07	Um each frame is taking thirty two millisecond of signal , just to give an idea . And there is a one frame every sixteen millisecond , and they overlap of fifty percent . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1937.3	F_F_T_ is only a tool . Uh um uh what we do release a phase domain analysis . We only use the phase between the microphones . Um 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F_F_T, _]
2056.19	Once you have the fifty , for each frequency you have uh the magnitude and the phase . So you can compare the phase of the microphones . And this is directly linked to the direction of the person . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2132.91	let's say you have four of them , 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2135.8	with F_F_T_ you can just uh , as I said , l look at the phase between the microphones at a given frequency . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F_F_T, _]
2174.08	Uh this , I can point to a paper , uh I don't think this is the right place to explain everything . But will give you if you look at your table , uh what we have developed here 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2201.22	in each sector you will get the value . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2219.43	And on this one you could have a large value . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2303.23	Yeah , y well I I use a value . But then you'll get two large values . Yeah . So 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2425.76	you can split it and say uh all these parts belong to person one here . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2448.1	That's correct . But then uh you can look statistically it wi it will be negligible um because the r of uh of the difference level . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2463.35	Yeah . It's uh you can listen to it , yeah . And then you can do some uh maybe higher level um analysis where you get the pitch of the person or 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2539.03	you can uh separate the signals 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2546.22	do do processing . Uh 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2550.74	so uh you can get pitch , rate of speech . That's quite easy . Pitch um the uh uh timbre en Francais . Um so uh for different person this might be quite different . At least for male females . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pitch, timbre, Francais]
2600.66	They will b yeah . They might be detected as another another source . Uh so you would have to uh classify the sources as human or machine . But again , yeah , I think once you see the spectrum , if it's just pure and stable 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2645.74	So all will go and be detected there . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2706.66	Yeah , you can play with it . Um in speech it's uh stationary over ten , twenty millisecond . And we make a stationary assumption , a local stationary T_ assumption um which allows you to use F_F_T_ and blah , blah , blah . Uh now in spite of that I know some people use much longer windows , which is not a problem . But 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, F_F_T, _]
2771.15	So yes . You you might have to play with it just to save processing time , like use slightly longer frames . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2865.42	you will see patterns um 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2877.43	Two different person will speak . So you can cluster those . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2883.72	And you will see that uh if it's long enough it's some significant event . Um this can be done quite cheaply , yeah . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2947.31	Um you can do sub-optimal processing and uh for example here I'm considering all possible pairs of microphones , uh which is twenty eight , and the processing is directly um r proportional to that . So um you can save on that . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3001.25	Uh six I would say , yeah . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3042.13	Yeah . Yeah . So it could be sufficient to uh , yeah , define enough sectors and 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3116.61	If you are able to calibrate your microphones um the ones who are closer to the person will get more energy . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3127.49	Um so you can compare that . It's possible . So 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3180.24	Yeah . Yeah . But you can kind of come back to that also . Um 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3237.52	We can also consider directional microphones . You know no . Um so you can uh their pattern is uh not uh the same uh depending on the direction where the person is . So for example if there was a directional microphone pointing there you would get most of my energy but less from you , et cetera . You can also do microphone arrays with directional microphones . Uh um might not be relevant . But um 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3343.17	No , no . Y you would uh assume 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
3352.04	Uh you would neglect it . The time delay is is very small . It it's only used for uh getting the a direction when you have a microphone array . But in that case it's not relevant . Um you would assume that they are roughly synchronised , not necessarily very precisely , and um compare the energy levels . But I have no experience with that . 	IN1008.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
417.6	Mm-hmm . Yeah , I can do that . 	IS1001b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
484.35	Okay so you can you can go . 	IS1001b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
520.8	more nice , more kind . Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy . Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look oh to it's not good . So okay . So it's not in theory but I I can I can say yeah . 	IS1001b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
542.67	Fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot . So mm we have to have a remote control uh very um out for that . Uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks . Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control . So all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have um a use a real use and not only or 	IS1001b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
623.92	'Kay you can go so . 	IS1001b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
644.86	to find it . Um and um lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use . 	IS1001b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
722.89	We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel . Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the and uh and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that . So it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and 	IS1001b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
803.12	to have the s yes and speech recognition . And uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot T_V_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh . So maybe we we can have a speech recognition in . Yeah . 	IS1001b.D.words.xml	True	[between, fifteen, and, twenty, five]	[]	[]
420.34	Or say let's lose rubber , take plastic . 	TS3012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
478.74	We can put those to the to the other covers . 	TS3012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
566.3	Perhaps we should make m 	TS3012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
575.94	Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . And that's uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that . 	TS3012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
592.1	Of course . Perhaps they uh no , but perhaps they think uh okay , the cover is such a nice idea , uh let's that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs . 	TS3012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
660.04	I'd say lose the curve and the colour and 	TS3012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1723.45	Okay , bring out the beer . 	TS3012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2006.12	I would huh . I would lose the C_ and just name it triple R_ . 	TS3012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
2013.57	It sounds like uh thinking about two different things and combining it . I would just say triple R_s triple R_ 	TS3012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2098.61	See you in a minute . 	TS3012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2181.04	I'll put it back in a minute . 	TS3012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]

344.18	make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Real, Reaction]
388.54	from our well designed tool . So again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . Um fifty percent I think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_V_D]
501.28	find out information about speech recognition . 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
507.45	the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Very interesting , I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if and you know , the the designers , but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[fifteen, to, twenty, five]	[]	[]
541.41	Well , I I I think especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target . I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
568.49	Yes . But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an that's a that's a very good question . I don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included , but I think it's an interesting I think that maybe shows more about uh 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
644.1	remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray . You know , it's I a and I think , you know 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Osbournes, Ozzy, Osbourne]
1003.71	Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1409.75	Do we have um 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1634.45	Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . Good , good comment . 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kate]
1696.83	to go for the the manufacturers . 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1745.62	Do we need um let me 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1815.62	well if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter um so you press power after you've um well I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2077.73	Um and you'd mentioned I I was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements , because it they were it has to be for a T_V_ , just to keep myself 	ES2013b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
329.94	Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . Um then we will it's a seven s um seven 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
414.58	Fourth . Okay , so we have to go through each point . If we imagine it's actually straight , and just give it a a score . So um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . I mean , uh is the homing thing still the locator , is that still 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
495.0	Yeah you can tell what room the mobile is 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
546.9	What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[cr]

1206.05	Oh , wait a minute . 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1380.92	Think we're being generous here with three . 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1420.37	Sure . And we could do whatever we like with the L_ L_C_D_ . Yeah let's just assume it's a good L_C_D_ display . Maybe I was panicking for no reason . 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L, _]
1594.94	Yeah . Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well . 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1638.79	I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks . Might we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1754.79	Even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven , we were to go down a grade to to four , we would have to do I mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic . You know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things , so I think we're definitely on the good bit . Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven , that's still only three extra points over seven . You know , it's yeah , we did it w it was okay . It was good . 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2148.77	Yeah , to begin with . Yeah . 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2306.62	Okay , let's 	ES2003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
427.22	Yeah , I w I would suggest that too . Yeah . 	IB4001.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
583.38	'Kay uh will it be dedicated for reading and for studying or can we have meetings there . Can reserve it for meetings . 	IB4001.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
744.51	So people would like to see uh the office organised by uh by by rank like professors and students and 	IB4001.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
955.36	Yeah , and you can look outside of the window if you have a sh quick meeting there . You know , quick meetings always get longer . 	IB4001.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1157.96	Because w we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes . Then we could have Gisella and the two fifty per cent people sharing the three 	IB4001.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1724.04	So , let's start then top to bottom : Maggie , 	IB4001.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Maggie]
99.44	I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . So I'll discuss them with you . Yeah . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
442.48	Yeah , I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
811.54	Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[cho]
842.81	So maybe we can put that on the bottom . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
896.69	No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top . But uh we we can switch those two , yeah . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
989.44	So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1136.79	Yeah , we could do that . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1143.56	Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent . So you can still th look through it . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1257.26	Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . So Or no 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1347.9	Nah , but they just said we need it . Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nah]
1380.58	Then uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1406.43	Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing . Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1423.35	So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons . So we can't use the flat buttons . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
1455.25	Yeah , that's good . We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to . But I think just the volume is enough . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1477.73	Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . Because we use scroll wheels . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1541.13	Yeah , you can make it curved or mm round . But just in two D_ , not in depth . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1714.91	Yeah . I think it's probably better . Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1766.63	Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1815.13	In uh On most on most remote controls . So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2006.99	Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2048.48	Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2054.37	I would do it 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2250.59	Yeah , we could do that . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2375.62	Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip . 	TS3004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
40.93	standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
103.25	Make sure the camera's 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
109.01	Yes , yes you can . Wait a second , I'll get it out . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
125.4	You should have one of those things and you can just take it off . Ta-da . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ta, -, da]
233.26	So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , 'cause it's the top part that's okay . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
342.35	Yeah , that would make sense . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
584.38	Just write small . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
637.05	I would agree . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
649.51	I would say two . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
758.53	I would say a two . I would say a two . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1115.56	that the screen will go blank , 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1136.15	Okay . See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . Um it might have influenced our choice . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1250.74	See , it says case material . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1278.4	Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1283.57	Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1489.17	We can do it some other way , we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . You could choose to have that or not . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1547.48	make the price fit , and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , because it also sets it apart from the crowd . They like their gadgets , they like something that's completely different . It's s something completely different associated with your company . Right , okay , so 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1841.51	Yeah , 'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , yeah . But it was nice having it there . 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2093.12	So it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . But I think but you were saying that that's quite 	ES2004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
659.41	Um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . Um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . Um here are two example remotes . Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . Um whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . 	ES2014b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
698.85	Um so my personal preference would be the right remote . So , it's got nice big buttons , it's got a very limited number of buttons . Um they're nice , kinda clearly labelled . Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . So it's very very user friendly , and it's got a little splash of colour . Could maybe do with some more colour . Um . 	ES2014b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[kinda]	[]
933.26	Mm . Um . But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers 	ES2014b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Cable, Sky]
1311.52	Do a lot of um 	ES2014b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1700.39	Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function . 'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it . 	ES2014b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1938.45	Yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . My dad was watching a film the other week and it was too dark , so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up . 	ES2014b.C.words.xml	True	[the, other, week]	[]	[]
605.39	what I found is we want to do fashion and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design . If basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad 	IS1002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
623.78	so we ma we have to make it look good . Um something cute and small . The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at . 	IS1002b.C.words.xml	True	[the, eighties]	[]	[]
637.3	And um although mo most people will buy s 	IS1002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mo, s]
665.91	um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , but um we should go for the 	IS1002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
770.8	Yeah and now you can c look it over Internet . But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . 	IS1002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[teletext]
852.39	Yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so 	IS1002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
857.91	Well I dunno . One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs . 	IS1002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1015.27	No just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . Um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas . Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um 	IS1002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2032.88	Uh we should keep it simple , mm medium-low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good . 	IS1002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
606.55	You can put the R_ and R_ . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R, _]
675.91	I will go next . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
689.26	Alright so I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look . And uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , so I had to uh look on that . And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
747.87	Um perhaps it's useful , perhaps for because people um lose the remote , they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something . And perhaps we could uh implement that . And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like but I can't draw , so uh don't make too much of it . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
854.48	and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this . And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . So they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with uh this kind of uh And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1005.27	Let's build it into a sponge . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1094.34	You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . I don't know which shape you should should take , but . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1107.09	Perhaps you could find something in the middle . Round but square . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1127.47	wait , like like this uh a bit . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1224.04	Yeah think uh Also in between . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1269.07	Uh did you have something about uh 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1273.72	So we should first decide about shape , I think . Which uh Then you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it , and can decide uh . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1331.12	But if you pu Now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen . Perhaps that's best . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1395.85	Y you could include a pen . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
1747.3	At least uh what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1867.16	Yeah but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1951.41	I think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , because you go higher and down . And the the pay the the the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1989.39	This concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place a 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2008.18	Yeah . But then you should also find a place You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . You can talk into the corner . Yeah . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2052.38	You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2152.18	Um yeah . Yeah the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2235.02	You should you should have a black one because uh I think black is standard . 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2311.74	And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2346.28	But do we have to We'll work together , but do we have to stay here , or do we 	TS3005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
167.58	Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . 	ES2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
181.63	Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together . 	ES2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
258.04	Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . 	ES2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
279.87	So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . 	ES2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
383.12	Yeah I can see by the ears . 	ES2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
473.99	Excellent , to match the rabbit . 	ES2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
905.52	So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation . 	ES2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
957.83	Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that 	ES2006a.C.words.xml	True	[twelve, and, a, half, Euro]	[]	[]
1236.66	Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so 	ES2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1274.52	Uh I'll see you in half an hour . 	ES2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
668.42	But I would expect it . I would expect it . Okay , so if you can go to the 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
678.22	It's a true story , yeah . It's it's yeah , I would say that the user comment says everything , a film to see and to learn . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
686.15	And to remember as well , yeah . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
701.32	Pulp Fiction . I would say that's that's like a classical movies of of nineties , uh it's uh directed by Quentin Tarantino , it's a it's a crime and drama , it's a a there i there are several s several stories that are just mixed up during the during the movie , and uh 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pulp, Fiction, Quentin, Tarantino]
719.85	yeah , it's a real classical movie , I would say almost nowadays . So 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
734.04	Sure , sure , you can see it several times , because I mean the first time you cannot catch all the details , and then i when you see it second times and third times it's 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
744.27	It's big comeback , yeah , big comeback of John Travolta , yes . I would say good comeback . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[John, Travolta]
886.5	Silence of the Lambs , that's a godfather of all thrillers , I would say . Fully in line with the user comments . Uh basically it's a it's a thriller , horror and crime all together . The plot outline says that the uh Clarice Starling , the young F_B_I_ agent is assigned to help a f to help find a mi uh missing woman and save her from the ps psychopathic killer with the help of another killer . This another killer is actually in a jail and it's uh Anthony Hopkins , and he really plays it a very good , I would say . I'm not sure whether he received some a awards for that , but it's really it's 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Lambs, Clarice, F_B_I, ps, Anthony, Hopkins]
926.31	Yeah , and we can see her actually on the picture on the on the projector . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1022.55	it's basically about the about the people in America , each of them is uh I would say psychotic in his uh his own way , but uh normally they appear to be uh s normal people , as as we can see them ev every day . Uh so and it's really it's uh the user comments say it's a deep , wonderful , penetrating uh film , extraordinary uh irony uh in a psychological drama about American life , and I can fully agree with this user comment . Uh 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[America]	[]
1118.16	If would like to go for something what is really serious I would definitely uh go for Schindler's List , and if not uh then 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Schindler]
1128.92	I would like to see this uh Shawshank Redemption , because it receive i yeah , it it none of us seen this movie unfortunately , but uh as you can see from the from your from your table , there is a plenty of votes . It's actually I think it's a movie with highest number of the votes , yeah , it is . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Shawshank, Redemption]
1165.88	Yeah , but really I would like to highlight that it's a it's a movie with highest number of the votes and the highest ranking at the same time . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1681.56	So doing nothing , just uh take it easy in the life , yeah . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1859.81	So perhaps we can somehow combine them . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2042.17	Let's nominate , okay . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2047.06	So I will take basically two extremes , I will take Schindler's List and I will take uh The Big Lebowski . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Schindler, Big, Lebowski]
2163.99	Yeah , but then each of us will will uh but then each of us will vote for uh our nominees , so I would propose to to to vote for s sun uh to to give the points to the to the movies that were not nominated by you . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
2179.01	So then it's it's more complicated but yeah , okay , let's 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2229.21	okay , and I wi I will give one to The Big Lebowski and two to The uh uh Shawshank Redemption . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Big, Lebowski, Shawshank, Redemption]
2265.43	But I would say these images are very nice and they are really representative perhaps . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2344.71	First Monday of May , yeah , so it's after the projection , and we will see what are the reactions of the people and so it makes sense that we are yes , yes , yes . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[Monday, of, May]	[]	[]
2357.16	And perhaps we will have some new members . 	IB4011.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
33.21	And here's the agenda for this meeting . Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there . Looks cool . 	IS1002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
49.27	And then we're gonna evaluate it . Then we're gonna talk about finance , and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this . And uh yep . And we're gonna evaluate the product and close . Got forty minutes to do this in . We should be fine . Let's try and keep this one on schedule . So 	IS1002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Excel]
312.15	Mm it's impressing . So let me get it , if I press this button 	IS1002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
318.33	I see . That's pretty cool . Hang on . 	IS1002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
361.91	But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides . 	IS1002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
779.57	Okay so we can talk about finance now . 	IS1002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
947.11	presentation , where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell 	IS1002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Paul, Paul]
1080.24	What did we think of the meeting room , I guess is an important thing here . 	IS1002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1107.31	Keep it , keep it calm . 	IS1002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1206.75	Nope . Oh hang on it really that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros . No requirements are changed . We're still under twenty Euros to build , so we're good . 	IS1002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros, Euros]
44.88	So welcome back . 	TS3007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
128.1	Uh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert , uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . Uh and uh I think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote . So , we have uh forty minutes , so I think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each , and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards , the the Word files , what you uh whatever you want . So uh 	TS3007b.A.words.xml	True	[forty, years]	[]	[Marketing, Expert, Word]
1013.3	warn you . 	TS3007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1765.72	Okay . But let's not uh go too wide about the those things , that's that why we're here . It's it's a nice idea , but I think that's we wel later in the stage . I've one little question about um a total touch screen or uh um a p yeah , a partial , uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals uh and uh the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen , but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible . 	TS3007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[kinda]
1861.51	Okay , as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh are done . 	TS3007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1912.65	Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something , so they don't uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television , so you must uh the the the the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television . I think that's the point what uh 	TS3007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
2050.34	Just build it in . 	TS3007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2315.36	Okay well uh it's almost at the end . So we have now a lunch break , finally , yeah . Uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work , once again uh thirty minutes . Uh I will put my minutes uh I have updated them so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too . 	TS3007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2475.34	Uh well , it's it's simply filling oh no , it's uh it's also filling out no , I'd do it after lunch I think . I'm hungry , so do it after lunch . Thank you all . 	TS3007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
10.41	Do you want to replace existing file , no . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
47.71	Yeah , but I've ta uh right , I'll just re-do it . That's the easiest way . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
351.06	is quickly find that uh 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
417.65	Okay . W the button supplements . Well , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . But So the so the real w the real question then would come in . Do you make all the buttons 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
494.22	Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
529.81	if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . We'd have one special colour and one special button form . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
591.83	if we just did special Sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
616.18	that would work out fine if uh 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
655.4	Well , hold on . Um , if we 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
672.29	But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the Oh , I see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
697.18	And go for battery instead . That would give you one less . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
806.88	Okay , but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
956.46	Go for one . Yep . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1061.81	Well , wait a minute . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1120.0	And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , which would be come from the button supplements category . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1157.52	Um , interface type um , well plastic rather than rubber . That that that would make the significant difference . You could either you could have it If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . And that would enable you to to do it . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1231.66	We got we've we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1262.52	The next on Well , I can just sing about . Easy to use . I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1385.07	Two . Right , come on . That's that decided . Right . So 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1434.94	Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1464.72	Oh . Oh . How kind . Right , okay . So , you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . You've got 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1609.07	Okay . Yeah , I would agree with that , I think . So special colours , two . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1666.68	I woulda said so . Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[woulda]
1735.91	Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you're making a red apple . So next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon . Yeah , l a lemon lemon or something . And that 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[next, year, next, year, 's]	[]	[]
1835.5	How it would play out , yeah . Oh . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1948.72	You could put in another Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . So you were talking about uh um We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2119.48	Until the design team comes in and says , get off . But you are the design team . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2359.6	I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which I will do . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2438.74	Mm , The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . Then you go away . You find out information . You then come back . You then discuss it . You then go and change things around , and then go back . So 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2512.35	example pel to increase create 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2555.54	But the other thing is that uh they're I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . I mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is uh acting as a computer um for um you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question . And then you or the idea is that the whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or uh or or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Joe, Bloggs]
2652.54	New ideas found , did we find any , no . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2698.25	To uh go uh reasonably well . Okay . 	ES2014d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
172.46400000000003	Right . I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . In the functional design phase I'm I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . And uh the detailed design in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . Okay . 	ES2016a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Manuel, Industrial, Designer]
761.55	Right . One problem you'd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part . That's one of the big issues . Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem . 	ES2016a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1268.36	I suppose you could do that . O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so . 	ES2016a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1275.85	Course you can do that . 	ES2016a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1351.04	Let's . Obviously 	ES2016a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
93.03	Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
263.2	Yeah , it's a good option . The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something . And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also made by the company . Environment friendly . Okay um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective . There are different cases that can be provided . They can be basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[kinetic, energy, Environment]
396.48	we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
535.19	So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . Yeah , on . Um and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . So , these are the different options that we have . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
560.32	Okay , so th that's that's basically now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important , yeah . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
629.67	Yeah , it should should do it . Yeah . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
931.88	So instead of going down you just spin yeah , yeah . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
954.58	Right . So maybe I should include that here as well , L_C_D_s um plus spinning . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1232.18	So L_C_D_s , yeah , definitely . Go on . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1287.16	Yeah , we we have we have rubber , but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1336.31	Yeah , tap it on the desk , yeah . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1397.46	Right . Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three . Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case . It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Di]
1464.73	Okay . Um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal , but uh 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[kinetic]
1475.51	Yeah . As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1583.52	Oh , if if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
1674.04	Okay , so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1790.76	I'll rub that out . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1798.1	Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1841.2	Okay . Um okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes , so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[L_C_D_s]	[]	[]
1865.35	So I'll rub off the other two . 	ES2006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
194.66	Okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal . Let's see . 	IS1004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
248.07	and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions . 	IS1004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
264.31	And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else . 	IS1004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
603.79	We can discuss that off-line . 	IS1004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
642.17	So could I just ask one question , um 	IS1004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
0.02	Which data . You know , I I want everything and then I'll decide what I want . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
38.5	We can get back to it . We can get we can always get back to it . We're not th actually throwing anything away . And if we decide to re-jig this at some finer 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
49.08	Mecha method . We'll still have the original and a method of uh of filtering . So 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Mecha]	[]
63.5	Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay . As long as the format in which we pick it up is a format which could be generalised to a finer take . Because the worst thing that can ever happen to you is you discover that you've done huge amounts of analysis and th you actually had the data but you threw it away because you treated it so grossly . Okay . So whatever we should be able to b you know , backtrack and say okay instead of every second , every tenth of a second or some such thing . But you know th 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
230.64	S so typically the eye will move , right . So over any one second , they eye's actually f fixing on a bunch of different things . And you and so when you say the eye was on this from here to here what's gonna happen is that is that if you use the real frame rate , it's gonna jiggle all over the place . It's gonna be on this landmark . Uh it's on this object , that object , this fixed thing , that fixed thing , okay . You're gonna get lots and lots of stuff . And it's percentage distribution that you're going to want . It's not uh I went here . I s you know , it's not like person walking . I went here , I stayed here . It's it's more like a fly hovering . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[S]
309.89	Right . And so I mean there are there are really two ways of looking at this . One would like to know for example the percentage of time overall in which two people are looking at the same thing , okay . And one would like to know sequences of they didn't look at the same thing and then they broke it . Or they did look at the same thing and then they did or didn't brea you know . One one could imagine those two categories . That's that's a kind of testing of our hypotheses . But there's a certain amount of um dues you pay to the way they do things in the literature to get your papers published . And one of the things they will want to know is an event series after some critical event , right . What percentage of time is given to looking where the other guy is looking . And what percentage of time over some , you know , reasonable time span of a couple of seconds , alright . So they'll be they they'll want to see essentially the gaze settling on particular incidents on particular places . So we have to be able to deliver those two things and they're rather different demands . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
436.77	Or how l alright . Let's let's imagine a typical construction event , okay . There is some part there are there are separate movable parts on the screen ready for use , right . There may be or not a construction already begun , right . Somebody makes the first move . There's some kind of communication either gestural , imaginary or verbal , that plans how we're gonna do it , right . Before that happens the person who speaks is going to do some kind of visual scanning . While they're speaking or communicating in some way , the other person may or may not be looking where they're looking , okay . They may be overlapping gaze at particular objects which are of interest . Let's call it the c the construct , existing construct , which could be zero . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
525.2	That's fine . So it's in a region it's in a region . Okay . But even so you're likely to get bouncing in and out of the region , right . So even so you wanna look at if we're interested in how long before the construction move takes place , um how much of the time they spend looking at the same thing . Let's call that our measure of alignment . So they're gonna be yeah , that's right , A_ is gonna be on triangle one and various other places . That's right . And and B_ um okay . And we're gonna look at the percentage of of that time where they're both in the same region . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna, A, _]
677.0	Yes . Yes , because for example for part of that time both B_ and A_ are probably looking at the construct , okay . If if your intention is to move the red triangle to sit on top of the thing already constructed , you would tend to look back and forth . Right . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[B, _]
799.62	Yeah . Sure , sure . And that's what the other stuff that's what the that's what the diagonal stripes are for . That's true . But we c we can one of the things we'll be doing is um categorising people I take it or interactions by the amount of time people spend looking at the clock . We'd expect that if we put people under time pressure they'll look at the clock a lot more . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
914.54	the and maybe he wants to think about that more and say well there were several candidates for the addendum , alright . And and it was the negotiation of which candidate was gonna be the right candidate that's actually the interesting stuff . So I should talk to him about this . He's he's actually um emailed me with a l with a list of things he wants to discuss at length . So I w I'll bring this one back to him . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
956.08	Okay . Um they do a lot of sub-assembly in the tasks they've been doing . So they may well have a yeah . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
966.83	Let's find out . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1294.07	Okay . But since the l the definitions of look a thing we're looking at are d um are the ones which get rid of the lower level . Like jiggling around in the area of a particular object , right . So if we're moving the the green triangle um we've defined a region which is the dynamically the green triangle , wherever it is . We will jiggle around in there . But it doesn't matter where we are in there . That's beneath our level of analysis . S 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[triangle]
1544.7	You can come back . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1835.65	Okay . So a definition of we're all looking at and touching the same thing . So imagine that we've just added a piece to the construct , alright . So now that's the construct . And both mouse symbols are on it , right . And both gazes are on it , right . So at that point you should have a line-up of A_ is on the construct , A_ is on the mouse , A_ is on A_ is on A_'s mouse , A_ is on B_'s mouse , A_ is on B_'s gaze , and B_ likewise . Okay . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, A, _, A, _, _, A, A, _, B, _, A, _, B, _, B]
2147.73	The gaze will wobble . The gaze will wobble . That's natural . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2282.83	Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . I always thought that was brilliant . Yeah , it is big , and you do have to scroll through it to see what's going on . But it gives you a very clear picture of what's going on . Yeah , well , okay . But so we'd we'd better do a test one and and listen to them scream . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2356.54	So you cha so every time a part is added to the construct , it becomes a new part . So the construct actually um has say it has six things that are added to some initial thing , okay . So if there's just the initial thing you've put it in the middle of the screen , that's just the initial object , right . Soon as you put a part , there's a construct . But it's construct one . Because when you add another part , construct one ceases to exist and you get construct two , right . So actually defining all of those as the construct is gonna be the trickiest thing . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2418.19	'Cause you can build sub-assemblies . And then you can start again . Also when you when you screw it up , you g start again . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2476.02	Okay . So we could we could essentially well , then we could cumulati or it is a new construct 'cause it has a new list of a new cumulative list of parts , right . But we will 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2515.25	So l let's imagine this , we've made a construct of two parts , and we're c i a triangle and a square . And we're considering now adding something on to the side of the square that isn't attached to the triangle . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2697.6	They're unique . All the parts are unique . So wai hang on . That makes the task a little bit easier , right . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wai]
2724.74	But but that's hard to code . I mean that's really a thing we might do . Okay . So now let's make sure that the coding would survive that . It's just it's a beautifully controlled situation . The construction task is essentially the same . It's the figuring out stuff that gets harder if everything is purple . For a just to choose a colour at random here . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2961.55	Okay . And I wanted to um to look at the strategy . And I wanted to see if the strategy was different when we could talk about it and when we just picked up whatever . I mean suppose I can't talk to you and I'm doing this task with you and I can't talk to you . Um 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2977.65	the thing which is gonna be hardest for me is making elaborate plans with you . I can reach for the next thing and you can go where I reach . But if I have some , you know , sub-goal , some long-term sub-goal , of doing something clever with putting these together 'cause it's hard and then putting these together 'cause it's hard , there it's gonna be almost impossible to convey that to you . And the difference in the history of construction , right , is an important thing , and I wonder how we can get that information back . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3058.67	Okay . So construct two could b um construct one is um a red triangle and a green square . Construct two is um two green squares , okay . Construct three , right , is a red triangle , a green square and another red triangle . Construct four okay . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3109.84	So we could zip we could zip through this and look at all the um all the interactions in which people build sub-construct contstructs first which we expect them to do bu as a wild hypothesis more when they have verbal communication than when they don't , okay . And we can do that by simply searching for any constructs that have constructs as children . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3197.48	I but it does have replacement . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3291.12	Unless they develop a convention . Suppose they start off with language and then they they say hey look , you know , let's do it like this . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3299.4	Sure . Absolutely . I just I just wanna make sure that a wish list , yes . Yes . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
3519.73	Check out 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3678.72	Mm-hmm . So they'll include things like the um the eye tracker calibration , right , which is not a bad thing actually . Because sometimes you wanna go back and find out if this was just a particularly duff subject . . Right . Yeah . And hand every time we re-calibrated the damn thing slipped , yeah . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[duff]
3827.4	Yeah . Have to really question . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3859.02	And then then they can do sound analysis on that . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3959.07	Right . So we there's gonna be a way to , sooner or later , to align the eye track , Camtasia one , Camtasia two with two sound channels . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Camtasia, Camtasia]	[]
4142.48	No . No , no . Do you have a powered microphone or something . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4336.4	Yeah . It's probably worth mentioning this to the to the guys in the garage in Toronto , right . To say mm-hmm . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Toronto]	[mm]
4474.33	Right . Okay , so when you I mean uh given that there are these events recorded , we can use any of them as the beginning of any of them as a start point , for example , right . Um there are also motions being recorded of objects . Right . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4536.4	So I'm right . Uh that that that's great . I I'd before we break up for lunch I just wanna make sure that tha that I know how long it's gonna be before we're in run mode , okay . So the sound thing the sound thing is stands in our way , we need to be recording sound online . Okay . So that's a thing that has to be solved . The shape thing is solved . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4567.94	We believe . Right . So that's that that that should be done this week . Um in fact like tomorrow for example . Um the shape all the shape problems are solved . Generating shapes , no problem . Um scoring shape overlap , no problem . Nothing is problem there . There are no visual display problems . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[this, week, tomorrow]	[]	[]
4701.16	Right . But if um if everybody has a lot to do and , you know , Joe could give it a couple of hours , which i is what it might take just to fix it , then let's do it because starting run-time is now getting to be fairly urgent . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Joe]
4922.08	Alright , maybe w should get on there and book mornings as far as the eye can see . Alright . Uh-huh . Yeah , just a well we think we spoke to all the people who who used those facilities the other day . But we could be wrong . So 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[the, other, day]	[]	[w]
5029.96	I get a email back . Maybe you and I should be the pilot subjects . First pilot subjects , the ones who um know which questions we wanna ask . And then we should get another pair who are naive to the whole thing . 	EN2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1090.65	Mm-hmm yeah like I would say that for programming uh keys , you said , uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros , but for the A_S_R_ system , uh I'm not sure if it's feasible to have this or 	IS1000c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros, A_S_R, _]
1223.8	So what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . So the method is ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like , and uh what cost the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end . 	IS1000c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_C, _]
1314.18	So you finding , just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key , and uh uh that's , with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um . 	IS1000c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1347.57	So electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . And uh so I think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology , and this is important , and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them . 	IS1000c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[V, _, F_P_G_A, fi]
1454.99	And the final point okay is um we have yeah there are some uh compromise to to do . So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range alright . And the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but I think uh with twelve Euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items , then I think w we could be able to handle that . So to to sum up um 	IS1000c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros, mm]
1622.66	Exactly yeah that's a very good idea , we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle , uh it's called F_P_G_A_ chip , that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh L_C_D_ and yeah . 	IS1000c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F_P_G_A, _, L_C_D]
2067.86	Yeah and find maybe a compromise . 	IS1000c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
537.99	To make it a little bit easier . 	TS3005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
565.26	recognise as a giraffe . Yeah , the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , it can reach everything . And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project . So that's my favourite animal . 	TS3005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[recognise, charis]
890.34	Yeah , okay , that's possible , but it'll get very big the the remote control . 	TS3005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
925.78	Yeah , play , pause , stop . 	TS3005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1015.4	Mm . Standard deliver . 	TS3005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1069.89	Yeah , but then you have to choose the this always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code . You can use which which type of television you have . That's no problem . But I think like the two pages on the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that's that's nowadays standard , I think . 	TS3005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
708.93	maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . 	ES2012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1065.75	Well , if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . Because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks , if you know what I mean , up like one unit , if you see what I mean . So it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like like like like a cog or something . So you kinda take it up one at a time . 	ES2012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1134.72	I dunno if it depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , I dunno , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , and then you could control the buttons with your fingers . 	ES2012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1230.12	the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy , look and feel 	ES2012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1321.92	Yeah , we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and 	ES2012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1663.19	And make that a fashion symbol as well . 	ES2012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1799.15	Yeah , maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice . 	ES2012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
1882.94	Well I mean on a onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button . 	ES2012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1966.35	Uh can I just get some things clear just for my sake . Our energy source is gonna be 	ES2012c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
836.79	Thank you , just pull it closer a little bit . 	ES2004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
841.71	Get it right over , okay , thank you . 	ES2004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
845.63	Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . 	ES2004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
896.95	Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there . 	ES2004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sofa]
928.76	Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um 	ES2004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
976.07	Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . 	ES2004b.D.words.xml	True	[thirty, five]	[]	[]
1370.01	Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def 	ES2004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1522.11	Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on 	ES2004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2067.8	I mean look at the mobile . 	ES2004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2167.99	Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything . So it's no teletext , it's only for T_V_ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus . 	ES2004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Videoplus]
2322.73	Whoops , questionnaire four . 	ES2004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Whoops]
196.65	So it's rather simple prototype . And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it . 	TS3003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
213.75	Sure uh just pop in at any time . 	TS3003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
314.35	The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . So we could cancel that one . I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . 	TS3003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
359.3	leave out the number buttons I guess . 	TS3003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
731.67	If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . 	TS3003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
845.37	The margin will get too small . Yeah . 	TS3003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1026.12	Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button . 	TS3003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1227.25	We could make two buttons out of that . And just um 	TS3003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1234.33	If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . 	TS3003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1239.89	So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel . 	TS3003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1285.75	If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . And make it smaller overall . 	TS3003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2081.14	The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy . 	TS3003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1605.36	Oh , I've unplugged it . Do you want me to 	ES2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1691.99	I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . You know , so I mean that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore , you know . 	ES2006b.B.words.xml	True	[fifteen, to, twenty, five, year, olds]	[]	[]
1920.02	Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . 	ES2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
36.66	Then I'll move this one . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
42.07	Oh no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . And we have a evaluation left here . Okay . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
491.69	Well it might work one time , huh . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
613.04	Well I'd say two on a scale 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
843.06	Yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
856.07	I'd say three . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1060.64	Dissatisfy younger people . Um 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1141.72	You . three , yeah . I'd say three , so two it is then or 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1354.53	Okay , well this is it . Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes , and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1395.35	We'll wait . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1431.49	I'll just fill it in . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1563.03	Yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1567.53	And then you can keep the curve . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1578.54	Or make it on a hand dynamo , but I don't think that will work . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1774.28	Because of thing Yeah , well you can at least make it curved again . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1853.45	Okay , but this this new remote we can afford . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1905.08	Oh , you can arrange 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1927.32	Select none . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1934.74	Okay , and now you can erase . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1944.64	Well you can draw over it with white uh pen . Oh . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1980.85	Let's see , we can save this now . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1987.45	And move back to here . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2014.39	Hey , but you can erase that . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2069.29	And you could ask things . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2085.74	So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2101.05	Well , probably to simulate the whole working uh process , huh , th you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[several, weeks]	[]	[]
2251.29	Okay , and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point , the leadership . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2336.45	And I was working and working and work Okay , well um but after all we can say uh we are satisfied , but it it could've been uh better . When we get uh when we have we would have gotten uh more information . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2431.15	Okay , so more time during the individual work phases . Um okay well uh I just got my warning for the last five minutes , so I'll move on to I guess my last slide , yes , which is the closing . Well uh , we managed , but we did it very quickly . I don't know if that's the best way to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , okay , this is it , but we had to do it , huh , because we have to have a design , and that is within the budget . And we evaluated . Maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product , but we did that before , and we also evaluated the project . And I think uh everybody's uh very happy . At least I am , with the results , so uh celebration , well , for the three of you , because uh I have to write the final report now . But uh well , thank you very much for your co-operation , and I had a very nice day so far . Okay . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[a, very, nice, day]	[]	[]
2493.71	Yeah I have t I think we also have to go to our own rooms again , but um well I at least . But maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this , so I can try to include it in the final report . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2506.83	Yeah , maybe . wants to , but at least this one . I know , we should remove this , but it won't h 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2513.24	Okay . And uh please put it in the project folder then , huh . 	TS3005d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
288.06	Okay right , let's get started . Um 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
298.56	For the components design , um next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . Then there is a chip and still the sender . So um yes including the power s supply as well . Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
393.89	which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume . You could do do that . Um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration . Um moving on to the printed s 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
507.22	Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . And that's it . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[circuit, board, circuit, board]
535.47	Um i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing . Uh but I don't know , so that is something I'll have to look into . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
606.17	We could do , yeah . Um yeah we should . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
655.22	And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
672.62	So maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
776.9	Okay , so we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . Oh that makes sense . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
797.94	Yeah that makes sense , so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[simple, circuit, board]
830.08	It's um I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside . It's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up . Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . So you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
912.0	Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1149.38	Yeah , yeah . It w it would make it quite complicated , where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1273.11	So maybe we could have like 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1280.8	Yeah I I know what you mean . So maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1333.67	Yeah , maybe we should see yours first . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1600.78	We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1726.53	Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , whether that would just increase the costs , make it more complicated . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nokia]
1747.11	Yeah the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same , but you could change the the way it looked . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1856.74	And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1953.28	it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as well . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2032.08	Yeah yeah . So shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , if we have to kind of 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2069.24	We'll go for single curve , yeah . Single curve . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2113.92	And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2167.99	We will go for the a a a apples apples . 	ES2014c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
545.39	He does have body uh 	TS3007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
814.21	No . Can work together . Ah colour . 	TS3007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
186.72	So here are options for our power sources . You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed , um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that . I don't know if that's really I don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[qu]
315.85	Right . And what we may be able to do , and I think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these . Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic . 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
352.39	The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want . So um and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
408.1	Oh okay oh like a wave , okay . Alright that makes sense okay . Um okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and L_C_D_ display , or multiple scrolling wheels . 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
639.54	That I would believe . 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
696.45	Instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter . 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
923.48	Well let's get a product then . 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
964.26	Function-wise , what does that do that 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1013.17	I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but I mean I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1040.24	No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1383.62	But we I we will need a receiver , an antenna . 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1545.17	Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip . 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1647.94	Well , what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels , and it c it 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1668.96	Well you just it's one extra button . You say programme start , and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually . So programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter , programme end . 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1893.72	Then you could probably afford this . 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1918.23	I would say thirty five to forty . 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1957.99	Or not . It might look like clay . 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2005.14	Probably . We'll let you know when we're done , if we can go earlier . 	IS1002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
180.27	Sure . I'll start off then . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
312.0	the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
331.07	Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
340.45	in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
363.93	So this would be very important that we at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
402.66	Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1033.72	get great popularity for our product . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1038.44	Um wel 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1044.23	Yeah you could load up the batteries , you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1137.34	'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1159.13	asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that . So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1173.92	I would greatly advise not to do it . I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1193.12	Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1461.8	Yeah . We would have to look carefully into the design though . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1468.87	'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1496.55	Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1502.37	one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1562.64	So we can pretty much just do whatever we want . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1578.46	No just to lie down . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1581.25	We'll go for that . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1681.79	Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1693.96	But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2146.73	And I'd prefer the corners to be round . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2151.01	Think that would be better . 	TS3003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
291.94	Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . 	ES2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
314.2	Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and 	ES2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
523.66	You can see we're we're all very far beyond the 	ES2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
573.89	Well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits . 	ES2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
813.63	See , about that thick . 	ES2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1770.93	Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . 	ES2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1775.97	If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier . 	ES2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2314.66	Guess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells . 	ES2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Play, Doh]
339.824	Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels . 	TS3011d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
420.314	It should be . yeah , that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . Fancy look and feel . So 	TS3011d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
439.254	Uh well appar 	TS3011d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1069.764	Uh I'll go uh for the two . 	TS3011d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1258.964	there'll be one hell of a calculation . So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . 	TS3011d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1402.3339999999998	Um I think think a one , 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um 	TS3011d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2082.7039999999997	Oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling . So 	TS3011d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
62.88	Still fifty six percent completed . Skip it . 'Cause I'm just doing a b yeah , disk check or something . 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
479.88	Uh r b well we can still test whether Camtasia runs anyway . It's just the uh whether it's the microphones are picking up things correctly that we need to check . 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[Camtasia]	[]
1112.69	I i well yeah , at the m yep . When people just uh if they can log on to it can book it . 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1276.32	Uh I'll I'll do that . Yeah , and just yeah . Mm-hmm . 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1405.91	Yep , mm book a time and I think so . Right . Well , I'll try and get ahold of her again today and see what 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[mm]
1552.31	Uh th they'll certainly be time because I'm right next to the lab anyway , I'll come back just to check my email and things anyway , so uh yeah . 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2042.67	Well uh just say stick 'em in anyway . Yeah . Mm-hmm . 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2126.86	Yes . Norman normally uh would be just , as I say , like add the blink time and duration to the previous fixation . 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Norman]
2153.97	Yes , so that they'll include the 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2195.86	Mm-hmm . Know what to look for and what not to , yeah . 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2206.08	Uh i there are well they're already identified as blinks . Then it's uh i it is at th hmm at what stage . The software that I've used uh p pools uh the blinks , so will add it on . I'm not sure what the default 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2438.4	Although we'll also still need a count of the fixations just so we can have you you've got measure fixation duration again just to s see if those they spend longer just f amount of more stable move uh eye fixation or not . Uh 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
2541.31	Um well the N_X_T_ stuff will have the more complete picture 'cause it will include combine all the linguistic stuff with all the movements and the actions . Um but there'll be I suppose just some purely eye movement stuff we could do . I s presumably with G_D_F_ . Uh 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[N_X_T]	[_, G_D_F, _]
2631.92	And uh yeah , that's also why I sent you the mm Saarbruecken software f that uh the stuff that takes the ASCII sort of format originally and then just uh sort of compresses it and things . Yeah , the German stuff . Uh because that little utility um does things like t well but you can tell it to what to do with blinks , whether just to lump them in or or not . Uh what the minimum fixation duration for a stable fixation would be , sort of you have if it picks up t fixations less than say fifty milliseconds , you can tell it just to again lump them all together , that's not a sort of reliable enough fixation . Uh you can put in these sort of of things . So that's uh that's a bit of software that's sent and that includes the source code and things as well . 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm, Saarbruecken]
2732.83	Mm-hmm . 'Cause uh al also just filters it . There are a lot of um strange event tags that the eye link produces that are fairly meaningless , I think . And it can stri it strips out a lot of the junk uh as well . So it cleans it up . Mm-hmm . Uh-huh . 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[al]
2858.36	Yeah . It's always better than making too much compression to start with and then being out of unable to go back or yeah . Lossiness . 	EN2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
115.54	The U_I_ guy also uh work on that , yeah , and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs . 	IS1004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[U_I, mar, Marketing, Expert]
244.29	Okay , I think this is more a question of of I I think this is more a question of of look and feel . Something that should be addressed later . We should we should go to other for the other topics . 	IS1004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
272.99	So maybe we could start with the market , yeah . 	IS1004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
709.6	Yeah yeah . Sure sure . So maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now . Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco 	IS1004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, speech, reco]
1703.53	and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_ . Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_ in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have . 	IS1004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1889.86	to browse more easily the teletext . 	IS1004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
68.61	Yeah . Alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . See if I can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better . Um I'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
83.77	Then I believe each of you have a presentation . Um I've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . Um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do , um and how it's going to do it hopefully . 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
105.19	And uh then we'll have the closing . Um which we'll have forty minutes for . Uh let's see , the last meeting we went over um 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
211.18	Okay . I'll hand it off to you and um 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
329.51	And then it should come up 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
356.51	have them both up at the same time I think . 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
601.23	'Kay . Very nice . Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , what we should focus on . Uh 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
1309.93	Let's see here . 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1315.67	Trade you . 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1388.71	And we could probably get away with black too but 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1440.63	probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . Um 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1452.6	And that way we can focus on our form . 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1487.24	Or or with you know I guess with any form that that would be good . You know that could be the charger . For you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . And that would be or solar . Or you know However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . Um 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1558.82	and some summaries for for what's going on . Um then we'll take lunch . Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work . 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1571.56	I'll do the minutes . 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1577.86	Uh let's see . 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1772.8	Maybe we could sketch a so basically 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1781.31	all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort . You know . Um maybe we could flare it or something . You know . So it's more of course this will look like a bone then . go ahead and erase this . Um 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1847.93	But they are all , you know , mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time . But then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in . Um 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1889.45	Maybe we could go with a square or something . Um 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1919.85	volume , up and down . Channel up and down . 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1954.15	If you , if we want the remote to do other things like um or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it . 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
2039.14	Look g yeah . Looks good . 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2131.6	Maybe . Ow . I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person . 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2325.33	So for the next um before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on you're watching trends to see what what kind of new information we've got going on . Um 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2341.29	Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use . Let's go with our our uh rounded 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Manuel]
2351.94	kind of fit in your hand let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece . So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . Um 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2382.17	And uh okay I think we made some good progress here . see you in 	ES2016b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
46.13	Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . And then we'll move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . 	ES2008a.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
63.86	First of all our project aim . Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . Um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts . First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . So that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating . 	ES2008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
101.16	Okay , we're gonna get to know each other a little bit . So um , what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina . Um Alima , sorry , Alima . Um we're gonna do a little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . Um introduce yourself , um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it . 	ES2008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Amina]	[Alima, Alima]
415.11	Um it's actually a coyote . Let's see . Let's see , let's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth . 	ES2008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
490.42	Okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so 	ES2008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
666.65	Um I would imagine all of them , but we could but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s . Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing . Um . 	ES2008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M_P]
814.17	I'll look into that . 	ES2008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
899.51	but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design . Um the User Interface Designer , that's for . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers . 	ES2008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Alima, User, Interface, Designer]
932.89	Mm 'kay um . And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . I realised in this past one we we didn't have much , we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . Um so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful um artists we all are um . 	ES2008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
996.44	Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you . Um just including all the things that we talked about . Um . 	ES2008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
1032.66	Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails . 	ES2008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
551.03	Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
613.51	Um yeah it's it charges into um some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery , 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches . And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out . 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
695.82	Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical . 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
872.2	Okay , well I'll move on . 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
874.85	Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts . 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[P_C_B]	[_, circuit, board]
931.57	they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[circuit, board]
1024.6	the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[this, year]	[]	[]
1086.09	quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1168.63	And you can peel them off yeah . 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1193.73	Also the just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen . Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[P_C_B]	[_, circuit, board]
1279.4	with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board . 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[circuit, board]
1292.64	You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside . It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there'd be touch touch buttons , so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ . 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w, _]
1341.3	Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but I I think they could get a bit easily lost , 'cause I had 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1393.63	Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking . 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1469.38	I mean you can you could do it , you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out , but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1635.08	Yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[li]
1865.0	Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one , I mean they use them in calculators so . 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1899.26	K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch . 	ES2004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
374.17	We can have have a whole menagerie . 	ES2014a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
502.76	Right . There's my dog . Um I like dogs because they're very loyal . And they're always happy , so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited . So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog . And they're also good for exercise as well . You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired . And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well , so . 	ES2014a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
840.77	Okay . Yeah . Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . 'Cause there's quite often lots and lots . And um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . So whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room . I don't know . 	ES2014a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
945.23	we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are , and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops . So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo , and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well , maybe . 	ES2014a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
89.47	So um the question that is open is are we going to select a movie from the nineties and which movie . So that's the first goal , decide for a movie to be projected , and second goal is to uh discuss for an ad advertising poster um for our um uh club , because we noticed that n last time not enough people came to the projection . 	IB4010.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
778.23	Yep , so let's 	IB4010.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
901.14	Okay , The Usual Suspect , do we want to say something again about it , or 	IB4010.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Suspect]
961.35	Okay . Do we have something to add on this movie , or 	IB4010.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
983.67	That's why you are in the movie club , to see more movies . 	IB4010.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1310.06	That's it's it's probably begin 	IB4010.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1995.56	At the end , to tell you the truth , I didn't like so much the movie because it was quite moralistic , because there were a guy who was who didn't kill German because he was quite non-violent . And because he didn't kill this German , the German killed , I don't know , uh maybe um 	IB4010.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[German]
2647.83	I would nominate uh 	IB4010.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2709.52	Or we can eliminate first one one movie each , and then we s and then we select . 	IB4010.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2752.87	Me , I would remove Silence of the Lambs because I think it's too violent . 	IB4010.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Silence, Lambs]
2843.88	Okay , so I'll go with The Big Lebowski , since the posters are already ready . 	IB4010.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Big, Lebowski]
2898.23	Okay , o or we'll decide after the projection of the movie the date . It's okay . 	IB4010.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
54.96	Yeah . And do you think it's . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
125.77	Um , can we have a phone , can someone 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
224.96	So I will start by the the basic one that uh 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
230.92	fits into uh eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros , and uh well first for both they have um a special shape , maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , but uh it's like a surf board . And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ , maybe the web , and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff . And also it's not too far from um a mobile . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
490.71	Play , pause . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
678.42	Well I think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1124.3	Try a 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1188.66	Oh you can push push it again , you can push it . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1252.0	So I will say two . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1255.01	I would say two , three . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1309.11	And the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . And um with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1340.39	Uh could put it at one or two I would say . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1405.62	Yeah . So maybe we can put one . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1709.18	Uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1786.63	'Cause sometimes look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , and uh it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2030.07	L_C_D_ is . It's okay . Just say L_C_D_ . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
2214.81	Yeah but if you have the near the L_C_D_ you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, uni, universal, V_C_R]
2234.04	I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
2342.61	So wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the L_C_D_ , um 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
2468.92	Because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . Here one , at the middle , and at the 	IS1000d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
120.82	And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , so they kinda just stretch over . 	ES2012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[people'll, wanna, iPod]
156.88	just kinda stretch it over 	ES2012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
159.74	and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ . 	ES2012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_R, _]
226.39	Or just make it little . 	ES2012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
249.1	fall over . 	ES2012d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
54.83	Send . Submit . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Submit]
152.0	I'll go first . Okay . I'll go first yeah . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1058.41	Uh yeah , think so . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1142.94	So perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1195.89	Yeah , we can make it possible to do that , yeah . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1231.25	if the i if the young people are interested in L_C_D_ screens , we should make 'em . And if that is our d uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
1300.77	Uh so if you uh Yeah , so if you uh you receive an email about that , uh can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in uh our projects mail uh folder . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1447.39	to refill the 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1486.54	And go to standby mode when you don't use it , so that 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1619.92	Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points uh , or 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1641.33	Because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons . Okay . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1666.24	Well , spread it by a big market . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1674.84	Well let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1683.33	Turn volume up . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1726.53	Let's hope uh to have some uh d 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1760.16	We should do it . Yeah . Sure . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1951.8	Uh . I'll search um . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1954.98	If you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2098.98	Okay , so use uh very uh lot of peo 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2105.0	Adjust with phones , yes 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2129.19	Leave . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2262.95	Just tap it . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2302.1	Yeah , because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . 	TS3005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
156.23	Mm-hmm but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
209.54	Uh the goal of the project I think maybe I'll uh hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ed]
386.22	Yeah , but uh before we talk about uh the finance , okay , uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also . 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
533.53	okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need uh some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again . 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
549.32	Yes , of course , if you need some help , uh so let me know . 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
552.14	So , who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , so just let me know so I can uh coordinate all the teams . 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
663.98	Yes , that's you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Christine]
682.18	Then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
696.53	Okay , so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
805.79	But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting , because uh he should know what's happening . 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ed, Christine]
815.83	Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so I need to submit to the management . 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
843.81	To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , so then we can discuss about uh further things . So , we'll meet when the we'll discuss on the further meeting . 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ed]
886.8	And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email , or uh just come and uh knock my door , okay , so I'm available here . 	IS1008a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
384.63	so start 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
570.04	Do we have to uh 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
700.44	I'll save it alright uh save . 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
874.37	and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise . 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
975.19	yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped , but that's not uh very recognisable . 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1069.7	But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , but then you have 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1100.21	Hmm . Well but it's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand , but it's it's still 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1143.1	to fit . 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1249.8	Yeah now we can still talk about the material , we have some some minutes left uh I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh . 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1321.09	And have well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works . The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , but that's pretty obvious , I think . 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1482.23	Right see you in half an hour then . 	TS3009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
675.91	Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . 	ES2016c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
760.48	And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . So the technology is there . Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . You can sort of just make those out . 	ES2016c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
830.25	Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . 	ES2016c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
851.7	Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . 	ES2016c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
869.53	And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . Um I don't it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . Stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . And that is it . Why am I 	ES2016c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
906.91	Just to sort of show you . 	ES2016c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
928.06	Yeah . See . 	ES2016c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1762.36	You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . In different ye yellows . I don't suppose we have to stick to co 	ES2016c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1845.19	It could and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was . 	ES2016c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
409.11	That we can discuss afterwards . 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
874.51	Yeah okay , let's go ahead . 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
928.0	Stable thing , that's right . To have , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm]
1249.56	Yeah . So there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve . 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1294.72	So there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves . These are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve . 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1306.01	So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one , it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1461.7	Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that . 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1478.89	Yeah , we can go to the next slide . Then uh there are different kind of chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . So we can have regular chip for control . Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip . 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[adva]
1548.68	Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better . As or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , so that 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1564.3	Okay . Yeah . So these these were the component selection and these things . We can go to the next slide . 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1573.14	And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us . 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, _, V_C_R, T_V]
1637.93	And uh as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s and we should have it on the remote . 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1654.97	Okay . Your usually your remote sits on that . So you and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries . Now let's say 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1684.56	So you're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . Uh 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2087.96	Because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons . They are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . 	IS1004c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
183.54	Shall I give a short introduction and then uh 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
195.55	Take it away . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
442.59	Yeah . It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable , so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros, noi, nice]
474.13	um I think a cover is necessary , 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen . So , there must be some cheap standard cover , um maybe white or something , that's could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
805.49	Yeah yeah , big and clear . But you could make a teletext button uh six . Otherwise , the people who read this uh are gonna think we have no teletext button . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
871.98	It'll make a difference . We have the better re I don't know . Yeah , I think so . My remote control's black . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
952.65	Um I would call uh choose two , 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours , as it would not . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
970.53	Yeah yeah , easy to use , very afford . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
979.71	No , you can do two , because um it can be easier . But then you're l yeah , but then you'll lose function f yeah , functionality and our fancy uh look , so . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1059.1	But uh , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh it's not an entire game . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1080.83	Th did you make this or the 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1265.17	Could you step a little to the right ma Yeah . Oh , sorry . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
1279.72	Yeah . Yeah , if if you're honest , we'll uh type one , special colour . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1337.08	Just cut off the kine yeah . Or yeah . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1368.38	But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1454.9	Could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back , and then we're uh has 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1544.67	You ma can make an an especialised extra gold version . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
1625.41	We sue . We Yeah , we'll start her all o all over again . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1679.33	For us , there was a lot of creativity . We could just sign up an uh remote if we liked . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1734.61	You could of said , shut up you fool . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1812.28	Just just write your name in in one line . If it's a little bit too small bit quicker now . It didn't 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1862.48	Nee . As uh as I said a m a c few moments ago , it I would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must um 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nee]
1871.3	Yeah , it's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . I it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1906.94	Yeah , it may um Yeah , and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size , yeah . Smaller . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2063.94	More user-friendly . 'Cause when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , and you do 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2126.95	Or maybe even insert picture . If you have uh some presentation , and you have some f 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2168.09	You'll just make a link in 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2211.81	To use , yeah . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2232.86	You'll rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance . And th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there , just use a flip-board . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
2541.28	Yeah . Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2599.96	He'll do it in his free time . So uh 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2620.3	You can ask your personal 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2664.23	Oh , before you change anything maybe you um save it first . 	TS3007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
578.12	We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it's basically a communication device . We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , uh yeah , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness . 	ES2008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
629.19	Oh , a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about 	ES2008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
644.49	h how well these particular prototypes work , uh sorta find out what people think of 'em . Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience . Um , 	ES2008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
661.19	Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment . When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people . But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out . 	ES2008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
693.44	Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . The second is is economic , uh we need to find a balance between features and price . So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product . 	ES2008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
720.05	So I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them , uh what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em , um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls . 	ES2008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
749.49	Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control , so it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . Yeah , it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ . 	ES2008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
782.58	The one on the right is a lot more basic . It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts . There are disadvantages , you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture . Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . So we've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two . 	ES2008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1237.77	I'll think of that every time now . 	ES2008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1546.21	I I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price . 	ES2008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1884.23	Yeah . Yeah aim for a an income group . 	ES2008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2038.48	We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . 	ES2008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
715.76	this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . So some findings um um . 	ES2006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
759.97	'S go back . 	ES2006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	['S]
767.46	Okay , so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons . Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice . Um okay . 	ES2006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
793.08	So let's carry on with this . Um 	ES2006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
855.0	mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's it should be . Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever . So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include . 	ES2006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
900.14	No no , the scroll button is a different thing . I I have a picture if you just a moment , I'll I'll show you . I wasn't completely sure myself , but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons . Look , this one here . But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round , it's like you press this or this or 	ES2006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
964.68	Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time . It it has to be small , simple . Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . 	ES2006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1590.07	But I th yeah but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of yeah , it's faster with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , but if you do want to use L_C_D_ , then you flip it open , but it's it it's more time-consuming . 	ES2006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _, L_C_D]
1641.87	Yeah , I would say buttons , because it's yeah . 	ES2006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2069.78	Uh-huh . So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer 	ES2006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w, w, L_C_D, _]
304.67	Uh pla 	IS1002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
324.16	So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town 	IS1002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
372.93	Uh , I can see that . 	IS1002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
547.38	Help me . 	IS1002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
218.95	which I will show you . 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
255.27	we have three audiences of two audiences , I'm sorry . Uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . Uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five . Um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five . Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent . 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	True	[sixteen, to, forty, five, age]	[]	[]
338.46	the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls . First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
364.59	Okay , third findings . According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um following buttons are most important . Um , I will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done . Um , persons were asked 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
449.41	Yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_ , like getting information . So uh , when you ask people , what do they use , 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
594.59	Just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn . 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1233.91	channel switching , and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down . 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2000.77	Add th that that's an opportunity . 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2155.05	No m may no , maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection , so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_ and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet . 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, P_C]
2261.65	Let's vote . 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2396.12	Save as . 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2404.0	But but you can open a from your pr from your laptop . Yeah , maybe . Save as . 	TS3007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3.39	No , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
27.19	And then find it . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
185.62	I'll see if I can find them . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
363.41	we should plug it in . Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
370.08	We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
439.91	Well do we'll do it on the prototype , so do two , see how much it is . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
469.29	Yeah . I think you just do one , don't you , for the 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
796.38	do . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
818.98	This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
839.75	And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
878.44	Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , so I'll go over here . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Real]
902.56	Right . So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . So if we do a sort of a one 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1221.61	So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1331.33	Is it sort of a recognisable product . Does it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1439.38	Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1529.07	Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1646.17	Okay , so tha 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1673.29	So shall we do a Well , um 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1722.79	seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a a special form , so And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well , I don't know . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1792.79	we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1820.7	Do you think 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2017.13	Yeah . I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . So , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
2084.09	I think well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . Or something like that . Yeah . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2224.11	get it i in the 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2350.47	Finish your meeting now . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2527.27	Yeah . But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . I mean it depends what sort of business you're in , I guess . I mean this one seems . From the website it looks it's quite innovative , but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's , you know , fifteen quid . 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2662.66	we did find a new idea , I mean sort of a kinetic remote control . I've never seen one of them before . batteries , I think . So 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2725.32	portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens , and uh I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . Surely they they should produ 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2863.76	Almost . To fill in these fill in these questionnaires 	ES2014d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
37.38	Okay . Uh door is closed . Well , let's begin . Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up . Um well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
73.82	Um well , I'll show you the notes . It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting , but I'll show them . We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . Um 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
87.55	Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . So this time we exactly know what to decide about . And then we'll close again . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[dec]
248.61	Yeah . We'll we'll look at uh . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
363.52	Alright . Nice , uh well show us . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
604.94	Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
646.21	You you Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . So it it looks pretty but it feels strong . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
862.52	Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
964.8	But then we should also have an uh an Okay button . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1077.83	Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1101.38	Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1168.53	Well , okay , alright . Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1182.68	I'd I agree . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1631.99	Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder , and then I'll put it in our end report . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1640.62	Mm yeah . You can uh put some uh which button is what . Okay . Um the trend-watching 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1667.73	Yes . We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot . Uh those kind of things . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1691.89	Launch different lines at once . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1729.54	Um well the buttons etcetera , we get from Mike . Uh this fruit and bright colours , yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour , we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch , when we uh well introduce our remote . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[the, next, uh, half, an, hour]	[]	[Mike, s]
1765.48	Yes . Well I'll have to , before I get another warning for five minutes , I'm going to get 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1828.6	Yes well we'll get it to hear that I think . But I think so . Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1847.33	Yeah . So you'll get it on your em on your laptop . Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project yeah project evaluation . So um 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2039.63	No , you you can carve it into the titanium at the back . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2048.24	Well , management would like it . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2204.22	We want it . And it's only f twenty five Euros . Come on . No that's nothing . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
2220.36	Well uh you two are going to work together . You'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop , and then uh you uh 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2255.73	So , you can uh draw a Yeah . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2260.45	Well I'll get a I'll get the message . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2272.29	Or get your mouse . Because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2298.08	And in your remote control . So we put a touch pad on it , and say ha ha . Yeah . We know you'll you'll you'll hate it but 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2312.62	But they do want some gadgets . So that's wha what we're doing . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2423.73	Let's go . 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2427.24	Finish the meeting now . Alright now we know what to do , so 	TS3009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
43.49	Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
52.36	Okay um the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um , then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria . We'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
570.19	It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing , you know , kinda push it . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
596.03	There it could have a stem like that , 'cause I do l kind of like the stem . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
757.47	I will give it a one . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
837.38	But they'll notice it after like a year , they'll be like hey , I have never changed the battery . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
877.71	Think I'm gonna go with the four as well . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
899.81	Uh let's say two . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
913.54	Give it a one . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1149.56	Mm I'd give it a four . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1193.78	It's totally fashionable . I'd give it a one . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1247.09	So I'll give it a a two . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1289.04	so let me exit out of this first . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1300.26	Let me one more space . Gonna zoom in real quick . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1369.85	So let's y say three . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1391.25	We'll just say three . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1429.59	Okay , so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1435.08	could have up to thr I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there . So 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1481.42	Let's see what that would do . It's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1542.55	Okay , we're all set . Um save . I saved that to our um our big shared folder , so you know . Um okay , back to agenda . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1568.18	Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information , um how how well I guess I led it , um the how well we worked together as a team , um the digital pens , the whiteboard . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1714.12	I know , let's think of it like a little jingle . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1793.7	yeah . Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1798.55	both the process and the um the final results and . I do like the Martian remote . If we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1880.65	Yeah , but check it out . So like there are all these like links , they don't go anywhere . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1885.47	But all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management . Um just wanna make sure you do . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2020.23	And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint as that's not as necessary to have . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint, PowerPoint]
2380.74	We should make one that walks by itself . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2419.91	Sorry , I'm just um trying to update my minutes . I decided to you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them . Just gonna make I'm making full minutes , so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that . 'Cause that seems a little more useful . 	ES2008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
310.91	Agree . 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
377.13	Okay . But twenty six percent , do you know 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
778.45	So , make a click , please . 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
793.43	easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
803.32	Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
832.68	Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
850.93	Our question of the style , we should remember that our company 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
916.01	W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours , 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
921.73	and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
933.44	And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
956.63	I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
977.49	And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
986.58	When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ , 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1006.68	It's a question to our technical design , our two engineers . And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1104.79	you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions . Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume . 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1119.52	Just few actions , a few actions for everything . All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen . 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1146.98	We can just extend it to any device . 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1230.04	Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next . Or say this can be back . 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1806.41	roll 'em up or roll 'em down . 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1874.05	We got a really good Market Expert . Let's send more , let's sell more . 	IS1006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Market, Expert]
391.76	by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . My name , my job , okay . The methods . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
406.68	Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
443.2	And then evaluation itself . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
496.43	Think . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
696.32	to handle . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
701.36	I would rate it a 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
714.06	But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
743.99	You can touch it . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
858.83	I would also say three . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1124.96	Personally , yeah . I think once you've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1146.77	Make it make it a two . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1149.13	Or make it uh a fucking two . You can see the remote control is R_ and R_ . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R, R, _]
1159.95	Has oh yeah , do did have nah y you have the black one . And we'll probably make also a yellow one . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1405.84	No , we have sample speaker . But b al but we also have sample speaker , do 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[al]
1448.8	Push button . No , we don't have push button . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1482.27	We could use 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1531.41	Yeah , but tha that that only is one . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1679.58	Then we can make add two colours on it . Yeah , two colours it . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1692.87	They can add two colours . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1930.61	just tap somewhere . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1974.33	And erase the mic . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2088.81	Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2106.56	Yeah m yeah , like she told . Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something , but now we're completely separated from each other . I don't think that was the best way , but 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2124.11	Yeah okay , but I don I do I think becau that's because 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[becau]
2626.2	Celebration time , come on . 	TS3005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
185.22	Um . So , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like . 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[circuit, board]
212.76	The case , uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
246.27	That would be our case . Um buttons , for buttons we have um pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are . And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . We're talking about long-life batteries here . Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Reaction, _, L_C_D, Um, board]
290.17	Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . Or a solar battery , although there are slight um complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
497.81	I have save this in the uh shared projects , if anyone wants to look and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . Uh 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1287.4	Um , mean 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1417.71	I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . Yeah . 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
1441.89	It wel well yeah , it would I mean each version of it has been a little bit different , but 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1561.04	And you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever . All these options . 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1749.35	Yeah , th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1806.71	Right . So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later . 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1825.27	Well , let's think about that while we talk about the case . 	ES2008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
262.96	Smile fish . 	IS1006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
487.11	Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like . 	IS1006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
504.15	Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame . Mm . S so then it depends you are to 	IS1006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
513.48	Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame . 	IS1006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
604.09	We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . 	IS1006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
689.33	Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah , you can only have one bit . 	IS1006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
185.91	Can try to plug that in there but 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
272.15	uh add some more underneath here . Maybe give it , give it a form . I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , so yeah , you have some rub yeah . Exactly , use both . Might as well think about 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
471.37	I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . However the colour , we don't have a say in that . 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
484.42	That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . 'S nothing you can say about that . I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . But 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
560.57	S give it a one . 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[S]
676.74	Y you could add an extra feature actually . 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
683.62	raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
689.87	We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far . 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
727.57	Right . That'd be tough then . Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
745.13	Let's add one of those features and say yes . 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
816.65	to fold and stuff . 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1111.49	It's just one mo single mould , we can do that . 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1158.45	We could of course make the buttons wood . Say mahogany or so 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1233.5	I mean let's let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television . You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . So s yeah let's take away the 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1292.11	take away a heck of a lot of the there you go . 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1455.47	Heads are gonna roll , believe me . 	ES2016d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
650.17	Yes you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work . 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
903.57	Yeah , go ahead . 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1094.75	You can also like 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1149.29	Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it , I think . Eighty per cent would . 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1353.8	Oh yeah . I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . So we can can uh yeah customise the 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1385.24	Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . So l like Ericsson does every uh 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ericsson]
1446.46	We should go with that concept I think . 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1600.08	Yeah , we should keep that simple too . It will 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1654.92	Or maybe you will get that information uh Yeah . 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1744.2	Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . I c 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1932.94	Yes , as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons . 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2100.84	Well consensus , um We we can put it in the middle , so 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2244.71	We we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here . 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2305.31	Yeah , but you can can zap down 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2350.05	Yeah well y you must have . 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2354.22	Yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something , and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh 	TS3009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
156.39	make a yellow well to make a banana 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
224.6	Yeah . Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . But normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
251.33	This is a teletext button . So once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
259.08	To navigate yeah . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
287.65	Well you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can f 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
373.43	You know , to give you the correct look and feel . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
390.04	consider that . maybe health and safety aspects . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
415.67	If I was gonna place them I'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit but yeah I don't I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
554.88	Or can move between positions in the in the number . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
769.72	I'd give it a six like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
895.62	I'll say five . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
981.78	I'd say two . I don't want a banana on my living room table , a banana remote . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1013.92	Yeah but it says I , I would buy this , so . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1025.47	No , it's I . I would buy 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1038.16	Still I I'd say two . I don't think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control , really . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1044.63	I can say , maybe there is a market for it , I dunno . Yeah . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1090.49	if that was like my limit , maybe I would buy it . Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably gonna look 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
1117.83	I'd give it I'd give it a 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1165.63	I'd say three , I mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible . If it was change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to but uh 'cause it's really bad but uh I'd say a three . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mando]
1237.6	Well just leave it at that then . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1430.78	Well , wait a second , no , it's it's double curved , it's got a c , it's uh 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1480.22	Well when okay . Well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1543.94	think about it myself but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button but you know the turbo button does add that extra class . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1557.16	You know . So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1592.51	Make it plastic instead of rubber . And then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1770.9	see if they like it . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1790.91	Because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well , to see you know how to how to market this thing . 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1860.28	our needs are . I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers , do we really need an integrated circuit to 	IS1004d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
153.42	Uh , let me see . I think it's this one . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
172.11	Uh , what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups . Uh below forty five and above . And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh , well , what what d do we want , and how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group . Well uh what I found was that a senior um 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[forty, five]	[]	[]
225.99	Think of the Teletubbies , for instance . Uh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and Well uh , shapes are curved and round . Y y you get the picture . And uh they like sports and gaming , and that gives them uh the vitality . Uh , so w well uh , firs Yes . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Teletubbies, Y]
249.95	No , I'll I'll get to that . You you'll see . Yeah . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
253.61	Uh , well f first off , let's start start with the energy . W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources . But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic . Uh kinetic , that's when you move something , then uh it gets energy . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
272.14	I figured , well that's ki kinda high-tech , when when you have a remote control that well , when you pick it up , it has power . That would be actually very nice , uh I figured . Well , we could also use a battery , that's a bit 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ki, kinda]
299.03	Yeah , I actually did . But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light . Well , sunlight preferably . Uh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
315.8	Uh for uh ultimate b uh n uh use of uh solar panels , you could actually use uh you could use uh solar panels , but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control , leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
346.18	So it would actually power itself uh from a T_V_ . But , well you just take up all the space , and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used . So I I prefer kinetic because it's uh well , the costs aren't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery . I mean , if 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ju]
398.16	And so that Uh Uh well , f furthermore , you you we uh checked uh the cases . We have uh different options uh concerning the cases . You ha I you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh it was kind of square and uh I figured that's a bit boring . So you you we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved . Um , single curve , it's just a well , uh , you know , it's just uh a nice curve . Or but but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's like several different dimensions . That gives you an whole new uh effec 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
434.26	Yeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , I f I figured . But , that uh we'll discuss later . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
460.47	Let's say that's your standard uh 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
469.95	That's a bit your d standard design . But you could actually go like uh something like this . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
478.14	And then uh in three-D_ effect you could go 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
541.5	uh , oh , talk about it later . Uh furthermore , buttons . Uh traditional uh or a touch screen . Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
554.4	And uh chip set , well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go uh with a simple chip set . But uh if we decide to go on a n uh um L_C_D_ screen , we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set . And that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
647.07	Okay . Uh , well that would bring the m m some more costs , but I mean the 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
685.2	Uh , I figured it will be m rather than hard Nah , rubber c uh this is a casing , yeah . Rubber casing , because well if you use an uh d a touch-screen , uh it's just a casing uh around it . So um , you could go for plastic , but I figured 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nah, c]
701.29	I I I would choose rubber . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
733.13	Yeah , that would cover it . That that would solve the problem . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
769.14	Yeah it m might it might . Uh , tra uh traditional versus L_C_D_ , well I figured we we all set on that . And uh , then also the simple versus advanced . Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_ , we we should have the advanced . So that shouldn't be a problem . Okay , well that's my uh 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
1707.34	But , well , if you want to I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance . Well uh , nob nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[cho, T_V, nob]
1749.58	What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control . And that uh provides parental control , for instance . And that's just an optional uh device . So there's n that's there's uh besides uh the remote control , you'll have a separate uh 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1844.82	Yeah . I can see games happening . Yeah . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2009.13	Yeah , that is true . Yeah , that is true . Yeah , you could you could you could go like uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy . You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2124.46	Well yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2131.69	Yeah , which buttons do you want to in it . Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2142.87	Yeah , you could you could m have people want uh want that . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2287.93	Well , if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen , you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom . And it could just stay there . Yeah , that spins around or something . 	TS3007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
308.15	Take my contraptions with me . 	ES2008a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
343.94	Sort of give an idea . I have no idea how one would explain this . 	ES2008a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
356.66	You can imagine it in the water . I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time . 	ES2008a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
272.92	Maybe maybe I should uh start . Yeah . 	IS1004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
315.8	Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting . 	IS1004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2058.92	But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars , it's 	IS1004b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
10.85	And again I'll take minutes . The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
30.71	then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Cat, st, Cat]
97.36	Go for it . Do you want 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
305.79	Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
358.21	Very good , let's have a look . Test it out . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
402.85	We'll just send all of our manufacturing to 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
526.32	Yeah , just prepare one now . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
657.75	Yeah , I think I think for um I mean most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to um 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
759.9	I'd say six , 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it , but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
927.09	All of the components have been used in other things before . But do yeah , yeah . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
959.5	Put fashion in electronics . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1012.7	Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1028.34	And we'll see if we can 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1035.09	unscrew this first . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1153.73	Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1182.4	Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1239.11	Push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we I don't think that makes sense . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[pushbutton]
1267.65	So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1346.36	Take it down to just a scroll wheel . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1350.27	We could do 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1369.6	You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1439.36	There we go . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1734.96	You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes . I'll leave the room and you can have another go . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1744.4	I think it worked quite well . Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1804.37	Yeah . Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . Flip . Vibrate . And uh yeah . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Google, Flip]
1903.61	So I would say that's the end of that meeting . 	ES2006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
261.21	How do I get it 	ES2016b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
293.27	to see something else on my screen . 	ES2016b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
348.23	have something yeah . Yeah . Oh well . 	ES2016b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
373.68	And I was sent a report that was I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . Um okay here are some of the findings . They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . Which is a fairly significant number I would say . 	ES2016b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
514.1	Okay . Okay . And so bas okay . Um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . And it kind of just went down incrementally . The groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . 	ES2016b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[bas]
2127.39	Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . Special order . 	ES2016b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
49.02	So um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy . Um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . 	IS1006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Rama]	[Mark, Sammy]
77.79	So what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing . It's 	IS1006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ki, concept, Sammy]
116.15	So , let's go . First 	IS1006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
586.02	Okay . Um yeah . Now let's talk about uh interface . 	IS1006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
946.59	And you'll be different . Uh in the train uh , hello uh no . Want to change my neighbour . 	IS1006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1590.92	Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design , um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay . 	IS1006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Rama]	[Sammy]
1627.73	and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction . 	IS1006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1736.5	Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy 	IS1006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1785.71	Mm-mm . Okay , so you explore now that you're going to work together these these two . Or or spongy an yeah . 	IS1006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm, mm]
1826.84	Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . 	IS1006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1843.95	Okay . So explore a shape . 	IS1006c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
231.44	Imagine you're doing it with your left hand , I don't think it's too 	ES2007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
238.16	But we can have both uh 	ES2007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1098.03	Glad to hear that . 	ES2007d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Glad]
464.86	B you think uh I I'm User Interface Manager . Okay . Okay . If I could go there with this cable . 	IS1005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Manager]
613.91	And then inter then make uh these keyboard commands , uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands . And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to uh r to realise the command . 	IS1005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
683.99	And uh also as uh I understood , and uh I think it was a part of uh Bob , uh uh presentation , people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button . So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control . 	IS1005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bob]
726.11	And uh personal preferences , uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see . Okay . That was my presentation . 	IS1005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
794.71	Uh no but as I know , there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff , for designing this circuit . We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . 	IS1005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
874.83	The password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem . A specific uh remote control has a specific f 	IS1005b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
560.87	Well , I shall go to the next slide . Um 	TS3008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
609.34	Yeah , I I uh well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier . Um 	TS3008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
848.54	Yeah , click on it . 	TS3008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1682.81	Yeah , you just can drop it . Yeah . 	TS3008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1718.27	But can we ge uh uh 	TS3008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1791.14	Uh , you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants , yeah . Yeah , Three three or four uh four uh colours , or something like that . 	TS3008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2124.1	The funct yeah , I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea . 	TS3008c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[st, joystick]
490.49	Go for it . 	ES2009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
541.53	Alright . Think I'm just gonna put down one uh one C_D_ . 	ES2009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
601.47	Love um 	ES2009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1179.3	I like . We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well . For those cold winter days . 	ES2009a.C.words.xml	True	[those, cold, winter, days]	[]	[]
1217.03	Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it . If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying . 	ES2009a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
180.52	That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
338.02	Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
650.62	Yeah . So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total . That doesn't matter . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
716.8	Yeah endlessly . I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . You can go into you in you main menu , you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
998.29	Drop everything . Yeah . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1282.42	Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if When it's on , yeah , it's turned on , 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1318.56	Say . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1335.69	We'll make it a Morse code . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Morse]
1357.71	Yeah I would go for five or six , yeah . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[five, or]	[]	[]
1363.55	Okay five . Let's not diss our remote . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1572.29	I would say six . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1615.66	So I would go for one . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1710.82	Ah we can do the math . Uh 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1998.91	Have to take this away also . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2039.12	So let's say Whoops . 'Kay . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Whoops, Kay]
2102.85	Okay special colour . We do have special colour . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2106.68	Does it mean uh that 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2180.26	We can try . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2246.2	We can make a l a logo . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2250.16	Like uh put it like the shape . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2462.94	But sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2561.72	Yeah it's only a bit like to that side , but that is that one by the way . 'Cause this one makes the angle either like this . So i if I change this , it will go there , if I change that , will go there . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2577.21	Mm-hmm . I will take this away 'cause it looks messy . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2725.39	Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that Yeah . You were more in charge kind of thing . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2800.89	It's uh it's The the pen is more intuitive , 'cause we're all used to writing with pen . And uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . But once I get to know the program probably , I mean , it looks better , you know . Or uh something like that . You can 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[half, a, day]	[]	[PowerPoint, PowerPoint]
2822.5	give it a kind of a home style , like we have i 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2869.14	Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . You know , you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever . 	TS3006d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
564.98	use Bluetooth . 	ES2007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bluetooth]
1047.17	Come on . 	ES2007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1109.0	like match how people behave . Um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel . 	ES2007b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[z]
760.1	Cause for example yeah . 	IS1003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
840.19	Uh thi this 	IS1003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
860.98	See 	IS1003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1304.29	Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um 	IS1003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1318.95	have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . 	IS1003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1402.68	And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris 	IS1003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[Milan, Paris]	[y]
1557.9	But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or I dunno . 	IS1003c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
183.2	Oh , because you would say that she's an assistant professor or something like that . Oh , okay . Yeah . But um yeah , maybe that's 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
192.88	Yeah , there are full professors and assistant professors , if you want . And , yeah , it's true that she's an assistant professor , but uh well , we see , maybe we can move a little bit around just to give her uh , well , also at least , maybe not a uh an office alone , but at least with just one person , not two . We'll see . 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
444.2	Yeah . Um well , uh I can think of some reactions from the people wi so maybe I can Well , r 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
452.5	Yeah , well , tell me about some of the constraints and Well , first of all I must say that there are also quite a lot of common points , so um it's probably not going to be very difficult to Yeah , please . Thanks . Perfect . So um , yeah , actually we um Well , basically the the group who produced this uh proposal is made by Susan , Martin , David and uh and myself . And we also well , Susan volunteered to ask Maggie and Pierrette about how they they felt about sharing offices , and . So , as you can see , well um Susan gets obviously the same office , which is quite a good thing . Um , then things started move a bit . It looks like I'm also in the same position . But the most obvious constraints that uh we we found here was that it was probably very difficult to have a lounge uh just a lounge in one room , because it would block us two full working places . 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Susan, Martin, David, Susan, Maggie, Pierrette, Susan]
514.11	And although it's true that the group , I agree , decided to to had to have a lounge , we propose to put the lounge uh in the room at the the upper side on on the right . Uh , so let two people share this with uh sort of a , yeah , a place where we have a sofa maybe and uh and some books . So it's obviously a calm place . People are not there to talk very loud , but they can sit and relax , and uh still look at at the mountains . Um , also So that's one of the main differences , I think , maybe one of the points that we have to talk about . 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
548.85	Uh the other one is the admin office . So it's Gisella fifty per cent because she's only half time , and uh the fax machine . Um Gisella actually has a lot of phone calls to make and uh it's true that her activity is quite noisy when she's there . Um , it's also true that she has quite a lot of files for most of the the projects actually that we manage , so it appeared , at least to well to our group , that even if she's here only half time , she should have an office by her own because it would be quite disturbing for other people to to work in the the same office . Uh Gisella has has no objection against sharing the office . We thought it was more for the the calm of the the people . 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gisella, Gisella, Gisella]
727.12	So we should manage some kind of decent space . It's true that these one or two last one or two years we didn't have uh a visiting professor . But um 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[two, years]	[]	[]
813.05	Um , Martin made another point . It was the fact that sometimes professor have to professors have to discuss sensitive matters about projects and financing , and they sometimes might feel uncomfortable discussing this with their well , in the presence of their P_H_D_ students . Like saying , oh I I have to reduce her t from eighty per cent to fifty per cent . That's probably something So I I mean , all these are constraints . I don't know how how you would like us to proceed from from here , or if you already have questions or reactions on this one . 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Martin, P_H_D, _]
1025.7	So we could have a separate room as a lounge as long as uh we pack the other offices . 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1148.88	Yeah , it depends on what kind of visitor you are exactly . So we could say some kind of low key visitor . This is uh very nice . Mm-hmm . 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1383.33	Okay , yeah . Depends how how easy you can write in it . Okay , so let's keep the reading room . Uh also I think Pierrette Pierrette and Martin p should deserve at least I think offices with one person , not with two . 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pierrette, Pierrette, Martin, p]
1416.83	Whe I I think I would prefer , and probably my group would prefer , to see them with the respective assistants , and I think Pierrette plus Marianne is a very good combination . 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Whe, Pierrette, Marianne]
1470.28	Now let's do something with Martin too . Um 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Martin]
1479.32	Yeah , maybe we can write it down , say vis vis one . David is fifty per cent and visitor one should Yeah , or spare or It's fine . 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[David]
1501.24	Well , because actually we have this project in common . You know , call I_M_ two . 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1699.53	Because remember there is also this Paola arriving um on the new project . So , you know , Susan insisted that uh 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[Paola]	[Susan]
1979.83	Perfect , just save it please . Maybe it's another name . Just say okay , it's fine . 	IB4005.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1070.55	I think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to . Just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , so and , and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons . 	ES2015c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1286.89	Okay , so um , this report is about uh trend-watching . Um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . Sorry . There we go . 	ES2015c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1298.9	Um So , just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris . And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote . Um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed . 	ES2015c.D.words.xml	True	[previous, years]	[Milan, New, York, Paris]	[Real, Remote]
1315.2	Um , so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across . Um , and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it . Uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . Um , this should be our priority , as we've been saying .

1375.33	um of course , as we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware . I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes . It could be one of the options . Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . 	ES2015c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1501.88	Um , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . But it's something to keep in mind . 	ES2015c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1778.72	Think it was called command interface . 	ES2015c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1935.04	The other one was audio settings . Mono , stereo , pitch . I mean I sometimes use that . Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . Like almost once an hour . Um , relevance of two . 	ES2015c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mono]
2092.39	Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true . 	ES2015c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2098.52	I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well . So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . Something that your granny would want on her remote control . Um , and international tastes as well , so 	ES2015c.D.words.xml	True	[fifteen, to, twenty, five, year, olds]	[]	[]
138.53	Come on , move it . 	TS3008a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
151.1	Now , wake up , bitch . 	TS3008a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
734.04	Yeah , whatever . I'll go next . Thanks . I haven't got a favourite animal too , so 	TS3008a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
750.18	Thank you , I'll draw a penguin . 	TS3008a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
760.88	I'll draw a penguin . Whatever . 	TS3008a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
766.56	you can start to laugh already . 	TS3008a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
782.39	Come on . 	TS3008a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
14.49	Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
67.23	So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to . Alright Nathan , take it away . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[th, Nathan]
770.72	Yeah , I can see . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
939.61	To produce each one . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
957.24	There is , it's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five . If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
1063.07	No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
1294.15	Okay . Sorted . We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1308.6	Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1465.19	And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1493.83	Yeah , I mean a nice although we do um wh uh is I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1512.83	Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines . Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel , um you know li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit . You know something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[li, lik]
1550.78	Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ni]
1584.38	We'll have more of an idea when the prototype 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1587.57	have more of a we'll have more of an idea later on . Um . And we just yeah go from there . Um , so we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we're more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wh]
1655.23	Yeah we've also got the the me the thing of , if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we yeah . B But no I mean we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[players'll]
1857.19	Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on uh multiple case colours . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1867.12	But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1878.02	Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh I'd like Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . And um Ron if you can 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nathan, Ron]
1905.8	figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . 	ES2009c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
322.05	Yeah , it's inside . Go down . 	IS1007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
328.67	See there's a role for everybody . 	IS1007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
335.58	But look at your role , your marketing role . 	IS1007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
464.97	Uh . We maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . You just tell the television I want which channel . Or or you can say for example , um 	IS1007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
497.52	Or a button for all the magazines , all the information documentary tonight . And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list . So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly . Yeah , that's one way of uh making it useful . 	IS1007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
527.54	You can use uh well for example anything . The the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . Yeah . 	IS1007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
826.18	By content or by channel . Choose by contents or by channels . So 	IS1007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
895.88	We will get information and then we'll come back in . 	IS1007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
904.15	Yeah , we'll come . 	IS1007a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
149.88	Look . Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . So . Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . The yellow there is the um the slogan , yeah , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , um but mainly it's speech recognition . 	ES2005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
182.21	Yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . Mm I'm not sure about that . Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want . 	ES2005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
209.8	That's that's already got its stand that one . That's it stand . It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . Um the black on the back is the slogan . 	ES2005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
225.01	Uh yeah , that Well , we did think of that . 	ES2005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
257.46	Yeah . Well , if you hold it , you can you all can hold it , is it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you've got small hands . Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized . It would have to be a bit bigger . Okay . Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition . 	ES2005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
525.88	So we could even add something . 	ES2005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
606.84	Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if What do you th We're trying to save money , so . Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . Maybe I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , because it's not in an ideal place right now . 	ES2005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
873.25	Oh could you pass the tomato please . Sorry . Thank you . 	ES2005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
949.36	Sorry . Sorry , carry on . 	ES2005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1528.3	Yeah , the company strategy , okay . Um there was lot of discussing , that was good . Um I feel I got my say . Um so I'd give the company strategy 	ES2005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1559.91	one or two . One . Okay , just leave it , it's fine . 	ES2005d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
265.78	Let me check that I I di I didn't . S 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
467.3	uh I would have I would have a provocative suggestion to put Gisella to switch Nancy and Gisella . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gisella, Nancy, Gisella]
494.69	'Cause I really do think it's important to have 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
497.46	an admin room clearly identified as an admin room and only an admin room , where you have files , where yeah , you can close it , you have the personal files of the of the people of the of the of the unit etcetera , etcetera . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
919.76	Yeah . So I would switch David and Nancy typically . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[David, Nancy]
1066.66	And I really do think it's more important for lab to be able to decently uh welcome visitors that come to the lab than to have a place for reading newspapers . Newspapers you can read them home . know we can go to the cafeteria or you can sit somewhere else . You can go on the balcony if it's if it's in the summer . So I I don't understand why we why we should put priority on lounges if we if we don't have enough space for accommodating visitors . That's just not not according to my priorities . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[the, summer]	[]	[]
1123.17	I would advocate to just remove the lounge . We it's a luxury for us . We don't have space for a lounge . It's let's be you you cannot you cannot go at the at the at the at the in front of your colleagues and saying , I p if I have to choose between uh reading my newspaper and disc and having a a decently welcomed uh v uh research visitor , I prefer to read my newspaper . That's just not that's just not realistic . I mean , we are researchers . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1206.66	And to drink their coffee . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1220.63	you can do it in your office . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1260.2	No no . That could take one one positions in the in the lo in the 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1331.87	you you will explain to your visitors that unfortunately they have a position in the toilet , because there is a reading room where people have to relax . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1363.43	It could be Nikos , for instance . Could put you can switch . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nikos]
1382.39	Yeah you could you could put me there . I mean , Andrei . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Andrei]
1527.77	To keep Paola with Maria in the two people room and to have this one with two , Yalina and David in the three people room . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[Paola, Yalina]	[Maria, David]
1702.61	Yeah , but then then you can you can move for instance if you move David to uh with Maria . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[David, Maria]
1741.06	If you if we realistically can plan to have a lounge . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1785.2	But do you have any no . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1873.07	David will go to the to the two people room . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[David]
1903.41	uh it starts to be better . And we will have visitors , for sure . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1984.3	Aha , so if we 'cause , Susan , the the the the problem the let's say the techn not the technical , the psy psychological problem we have is pra I'm extremenly happy with that solution . It would be a workab work working solution starting from January , when Paola will be here . But currently if we present it as it is , we have a three person room that is only occupied by a masters student . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[January]	[Paola]	[Susan, workab]
2021.51	Ah , so this one and this two one are just ah okay , okay . So then we would have two people there . Okay . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2060.69	Uh the second point I would suggest is that before you go to defend it , you should uh mm circulate it uh over mail to all the all the con involved people . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2095.53	cost anything , it's just people will look at it , say oh , great , I have a view on the mountain and I'm uh with a person I like , so I'm happy . 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2217.32	And if you go back to the uh to the uh other sli slide where you have the furniture so with this uh we do we have any m any any word to say and uh so that I would like to have a red chair or a blue desk uh or a 	IB4004.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
136.13	I'll just put it in there . 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
159.21	Move to meeting room . 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
195.98	Yes . Me first again or yeah . Alright . Did you open it already or no . Ah . 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
231.31	Uh well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . Uh it shows a number of developments . Uh I will address them uh in a moment . Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public . 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
247.92	Um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . So um the developments I will address them oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . So to give you an idea . 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1000.81	get your own information . 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1259.88	So from top view it looks kinda like this . But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape . Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1276.88	Maybe you can c have this kind of shape . A little upwards . So that the screen is more 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1283.76	towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen . Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . So then you have double double curved in some way . So this this is so the screen is positioned over here . 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1420.71	True . It uh c it can go open . 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1518.88	Yeah we we better so choose one 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1522.56	Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . But that's the kind of the idea , so it lays good in the hand , and then on on the side with with your thumb , you you can you can use , yeah , you can use the button option 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2036.34	Yeah . I I probably get instruction on that , how to do that , so I make another presentation I guess . I kn I know what's gonna happen in in yeah so 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2140.86	Oh we skip this I guess . Sound button press . 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2179.59	Maybe you should draw it very large like this . 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2374.92	It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this . 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2438.53	Come on . So this is the shape . Oh . It hasn't 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2481.35	Uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control . Yes . 	TS3006c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
161.7	So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . 	ES2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
754.45	With a simple command like locate . And then it could start to beep and 	ES2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
833.81	Oh go ahead . 	ES2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1013.73	See if there if there's even interest out there . Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere . 	ES2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1323.05	Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . That'd be okay . 	ES2009b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
238.87	Wait , there's was one thing I wanted to ask . Uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
258.27	Yeah , but do we have do we need extra buttons , for example some uh some have to 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
329.76	No , listen listen . When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . The one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
411.19	But you give the input . You push the one . That's the same thing as the button with the one and it yes it it is . Think about it . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
454.99	No , we'll apply them then for now . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
498.16	I do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . M 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
522.86	Okay , well we'll see . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
689.02	Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues still to come . But we have to look n I don't know . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
949.79	Oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
989.76	Yeah well , let that let's make that a one . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1078.01	But I do think it's more 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1081.25	But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1274.12	Ah yeah , just make it we'll make it a two . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1286.92	Yeah . Yeah , you have make an slogan is quite obvious . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1318.65	Yeah , make it a two . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1417.8	Well , we uh We'll see . We'll stumble upon some problems . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1432.06	try it again . First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1444.47	But let's let's st start with beginning . We include one battery . I i uh I'll explain its Uh , the the components are listed over here . Uh , price is given . We um yeah , we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . And then uh , we'll uh calcula Don't watch the number yet . I don't know if it's filled in properly . Okay , we need one battery . One battery . I think one battery is enough . We don't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . A s okay , this this is a p first problem . Uh , I think 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[st]
1479.07	we should know how many 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1534.39	Maybe you can uh look it up right now . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1626.62	Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost I don't know . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1687.39	Well , okay , well well let's make it just one . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1697.18	give our own interpretation to , because else we would really have a problem . It would be impossible to make it 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1725.17	Yeah , we could skip the numbers . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1738.58	Okay , we'll we'll just okay . But then still , when we there's no room for a docking station or something . Tha w Le let's see th we have uh oh yeah , button supplements . We'll give the buttons special colour . We'll give them a special form . Uh , I think we should mark the special form thing , because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Tha, w, Le]
1796.38	There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1866.75	And maybe then we can do something extra . Oh , n uh oh , still oh , it's gonna get more expensive with . Two . Then we have some money left . We can put then 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1877.4	We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1891.7	Yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . That's also maybe an idea . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ki]
1897.92	Yeah that's what then what he has to find out . Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us . Maybe is that that's nice to know . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1934.71	Yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1999.83	You can look at it for s presentation . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2378.26	Yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one we can still make 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2513.87	It We can make it yeah no . Becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Becau]
2529.99	Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[qui, y]
2574.49	We can really can do the docking thing , uh it's not yeah , uh we can do it , but it's would be a easy way out . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2652.68	Yeah , and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2657.88	just to give it some extra special feature , and uh I know it will work , but uh it's it's an They're they're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2668.66	to make it happen . 	TS3008d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
245.43	Okay . I will see . 	IS1005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
311.07	I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature . We'll see . 	IS1005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
716.08	So , say power circuit here . Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . So no problem . There can be also solar cell . Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . So at least seven to seven . 	IS1005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
791.86	say here . Interface to the microphone . Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So infra-red here . So the once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . Um I have to check what I wanted to 	IS1005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_F_T, _, _, T_F_T, _]
980.94	Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . 	IS1005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1300.52	Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . I'll make it . 	IS1005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1348.69	Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and I will work it out . 	IS1005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1459.7	Well , it can be whatever you want . But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . 	IS1005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1558.89	It would be cool , yeah . Peeling of the banana , you know , should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden . 	IS1005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1572.62	First layer obviously spo Yeah , w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . 	IS1005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
1807.83	Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept 	IS1005c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
195.42	thirt the plus . You can go one , three or something . You press that first and then you go one three yeah . 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
318.53	Just so we can flick 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
348.14	And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . Okay . 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
744.51	I w I'd say two I think . 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
791.43	I'll go for three as well . 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
844.5	Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
941.52	I think we have to market it in the right way , that um to say that it is simplistic . So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . We have to market it . 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
967.84	Oh no the plus . You're use the zero . Make a new one . 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1045.45	Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it'll vibra 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1088.86	It would have to be in the market 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1161.36	I'd say w yeah one . Yeah . 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1219.43	I I'd say t two . Yeah . 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1869.39	to fit in with our areas of expertise . 	ES2015d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
145.36	uh talk about working design . Um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . It's an electrical circuit 	TS3008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
178.64	Um , the known technology can make a cost very low . Uh , it's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . And and the components are very uh very cheap . Um , 	TS3008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
215.93	um part of the remote control . Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it's it is uh 	TS3008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1123.72	But you can put them under the same button . 	TS3008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1144.42	But you can put a play and stop and and rewind . 	TS3008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1339.89	Yes , but you could put 	TS3008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1342.08	on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages . If you have seven pages , you can go up and down . 	TS3008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1398.03	Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick . 	TS3008b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
211.48	the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . So it's quite convenient for user to use it . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s, circle, t]
259.88	and there's some cute button . You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
279.72	Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
517.8	Uh , for turn turn the ball . If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
610.8	Yeah , yeah . So you can capture voice yeah , you c 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
615.51	Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
666.97	You can use this in this way . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
673.27	Th this is the base . So you can turn to change the channel . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
717.56	I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . So change . Yeah . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
765.35	Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
768.39	I think so I think so you can do it . I think so , you can just change . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
818.95	You ca you can turn this . Or you ca you can you can also turn this . For this you can tune it's for tune . You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . It's like fine , from coarse to fine . This is coarse , this is fine . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[channel, channel]
879.38	Yeah , agree , agree . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
935.61	Yeah , yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
972.95	Uh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1315.91	We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1361.17	Wait . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1464.58	Okay . Okay . Agree . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1490.44	Cou could we have look 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Cou]
1504.07	Okay . So let's say 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1609.71	to create a control instead of a computer . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1794.87	And you can celebrate your leadership . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1814.96	Yeah , it's your job . Sell it . Yeah . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1909.62	So we have give him give it a cute name . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2023.2	So buy one . 	IS1003d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
325.17	Yeah go ahead . 	IS1005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
434.0	Maybe put it up Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something . 	IS1005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
500.86	Yeah . Maybe we should just continue . Yeah , don't worry about it . 	IS1005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
448.32	Let's have a squeezable remote . 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
601.7	Okay . Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way . 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
775.63	The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1078.74	we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or , or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . Uh um 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1217.15	I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1228.55	And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that . 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1265.92	Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that . 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
1285.12	I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . But I think that should be I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . So that should be simple . 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1399.14	Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1603.8	Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator . 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1640.04	Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1743.4	Okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate . 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2212.26	Okay , I'll stay in here . 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2223.75	Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2248.83	I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing well . 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2285.45	Well I I did notice looking at I mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable . 	ES2007c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_R, _]
51.25	to make presentation about 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
58.72	And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
68.53	control . And we have think I got a new project requirement . So I think 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
98.31	And of course we should have our image 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
106.59	So , let's start with the 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
117.01	Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want . 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
151.3	Do you want to open 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
437.04	Yeah we can change the b . 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
478.62	Oh we have so let's move to 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
703.9	Keep the navigation but 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
945.86	But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1020.69	If it's necessary can you can do that . We can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really a problem . 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1254.47	So let's go for the the lunch break , and 	IS1007b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
593.28	Uh I will start . Uh Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that won't be uh our goal , I think . And uh g big buttons , m uh that's easier to use than uh I think . 	TS3010a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
694.61	Help also . Thank you . 	TS3010a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
633.1	Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push . 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
672.91	No . The television must do that . So 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
775.38	Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . It's very important . 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
976.35	it's uh Ah , let's see . 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1015.81	Now , we have to make some concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1046.94	I'll paint . Okay . Well 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1267.99	Yeah , but I'll zap . Fuck . Out . 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1286.4	Paint it . 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1303.59	Unbelievable . Do I have to do everything . Blank . You have 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Unbelievable, Blank]
1636.44	Think we have to keep them . 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1668.53	Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can You have to use t with one hand . 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1688.72	So , please look at it . 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1991.31	Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up . 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1998.88	You two stay here . Paint it . 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2008.68	I think it's clear . Check your mail . So 	TS3010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
346.66	Suppose I can draw an animal , yeah . 	ES2011a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
68.74	I'd say no , but I d I mean I thought we had basically the same ideas to b I don't remember ever having strong arguments about what should be in what group or it was just the rules about things that s yeah . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
115.87	Yeah , that would be handy . Sign off . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
122.61	We did send it to him , yeah . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
395.88	You can point to a soft component . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
429.55	Yeah . This is the this is the thing you point to , yep . Yeah , that's the thing you point to and this is a ph a physical mechanism . So yeah , I'd say 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
441.93	Two down . Two hundred and fifteen to go . Excellent . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
567.22	And if I did it again , I'd say a slight depression of the continuum and possibly well , 'cause you can see both the slight depression and the Lyman limit . But we're supposed to say the descriptive words of the features . So 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Lyman]
585.06	Yeah , but they would be the same they'd both be the same spectral feature , whereas here they're two spectral features . There's a Lyman limit , which you could see , and then there's a slight depression near it . But 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Lyman]
692.84	You could point to it if it were there . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
900.28	Yeah , you could do . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
951.65	If you look at a quasar and you see a bunch uh if you got a bunch of clouds of gas in the way , you can see these things and but you wouldn't be able to point at one of them and say ah , that's a damp yeah . They're gonna be at different red-shifts . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
990.64	I would mark that . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1112.35	Um again I'd say this this is a physical process , not a spectral feature . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1147.27	Wait , where 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1393.47	Yeah . Let's keep them . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1430.43	Oh , rubbish . Excellent . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]

1677.89	Take it again , but systems should be out . Yeah . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1750.01	See that i that's talking about the the flux of kin of ionising photons rather then the continuum of that spectrum . So I don't like that one . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1789.44	Yeah , you can have that as well . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1827.48	Well , you'd know where they are in the 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1857.11	Yeah , but the feature itself is blue wing flux or if it was said blue wing feature , we'd mark feature . Hmm . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1913.31	Well you can point to blue wing flux , 'cause you have your line and there's the blue wing flux . But if the line peak is increasingly shifted , you'd 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2244.73	Yeah , let's leave it in . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2380.08	Ah . I'm right , look . Don't include modifiers of regions or systems , E_G_ 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[E_G]
2390.96	G ah , look at that . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2415.47	Yeah , we could always change this if we think we're right , rather than going back through and 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2530.96	Yeah , just cross those out . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2688.05	Yeah , take out the blanketing . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]

2952.95	Yeah . If we're going to have them , let's have them . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3071.03	Mm the soft excess you can definitely point to on an X_ ray thing . You kn you know if there's one there or not , you could say that's that . So 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X, _]
3109.43	Give that for red and blue components , but I wouldn't probably give that for soft component . Because a soft excess is a uh I mean that's an X_ ray thing . Like a break , you say oh look , there's 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
3125.84	Mm . Yeah . Yeah , I'd take out red and blue . 	EN2006a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
828.55	Come on . . 	TS3010b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
837.59	Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . 	TS3010b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, _]
904.07	We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . 	TS3010b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
947.82	what way we would go . 	TS3010b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1392.07	get the younger 	TS3010b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
42.57	wanna go today . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[wanna]
123.09	Oh , write the sum okay , right . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
244.03	Give you false impressions of what's hap s something's going on . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
392.81	Yeah . Actually can we run it on Windows . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Windows]
693.07	Right . Yeah . Let's take 'em to the next joke . Yeah . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
911.77	Yeah . Oh it's possib some people are balanced . Some people are No , I know some balanced people . no . Maybe I'll check see if I can find anyone . Um 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1002.54	Yes . Yeah . Get a lot of audio . No . Okay . Um okay , well this this looks good . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1039.0	feasible to open up more than one well , as many mm NOM objects as we can for each meeting to do like we were gonna need like figure that the ranking did make sense , like to be looking through the highest ranked ones first . So if we are gonna look through only five of them , just pick the top five to to do the the search and Since that's probably what we're looking for anyways . So 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[NOM]
1095.01	Yeah . How do you guys find the documentation for N_X_T_ and 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[N_X_T]	[_]
1173.59	Mm 'kay . Well we yeah , I guess well we can still come up with like test cases or whatever for for the people and just yeah , come up with scenarios , that sort of thing . I mean that's that's fairly straight-forward . And could actually be fun . Yeah , exactly . That's true , just brain-storm , yeah . Yeah . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
1207.73	To work on it as well . Yeah . . No , I've I've got my D_N_L_G_ presentation on Monday . I have to read the paper . Yeah . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[Monday]	[]	[]
1231.33	We'll probably have to talk to Steve at some point as well I guess . But um 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Steve]
1236.76	I'll probably just have a regular Tuesday meeting with him . Like we can send him an email , but I don't know if he's around even . He's not around this week , is he or that's why I think that's why we didn't have the the meeting . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[Tuesday, this, week]	[]	[]
1251.8	Yeah , it's true . Although do we really want the answer . S s So if we don't ask we can push it off and 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1308.66	Yeah . Actually some other friends of mine in different programmes might might be more willing . Have more of a break . So that might be an idea , get a range of types of people as well . Like not like highly computer lit like not , you know , Linux literate or yeah . I think that might be good , as well . Set a wider range of people . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Linux]
1329.5	Uh no , I think like three or four maybe . Bet that would be a good yeah , I think that d No , that's that's a lot . No . Yeah , exactly . Like the thing like did an H_C_I_ course a while ago and it's just that's what these yeah , there's three people . Yeah . And that was fine . Then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people . Yeah . Yeah . Oh yeah . S We don't want to . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bet, _]
1479.02	Actually it's fun No . No , it's it just funny that , you know , have it finish by Monday . 'Cause after Monday I'm pretty much free for about a week or so . It's like it's like if we had , you know , a bit more time . Yeah . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[Monday, Monday, about, a, week, or, so]	[]	[]
1566.49	We should have it done anyways . But okay , yeah . Sure . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1571.28	Hopefully , but yeah . Is is that is that a part of the demonstration , did they want that information , the evaluation as part of yep . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1618.99	No . I'd expect somewhere ten to fifteen pages . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1695.01	Although just to get it out of the way . So I'll try and remember to do that to my own s 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1735.17	Then as these come up it'll just pop 'em in there . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1766.99	Yeah , so so there's a couple of those little things as we Yeah , exact It's beautiful . Yeah , m M_ makes more sense . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M, _]
1799.27	If you have like a particular w window that you want me to mimic its behaviour , then like just find it in the programme and just say , okay , just how this one does it . So if it's like the topic window or the whatever . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1816.63	So then I can just sorta trace back and figure out what objects they are and bring 'em into here . So 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2183.72	Hmm . Probably not . I mean just get work done . I think that's what I've gotta do . 	EN2002d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
33.49	'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . Welcome everybody . Um hope your sessions went well . Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this sure . 	ES2011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
344.4	Yeah . Just move right on . 	ES2011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
768.96	Okay . Well thank you everybody . Um we have we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um , 	ES2011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna, teletext]
814.42	phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um . 	ES2011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
846.61	yeah . Do Let's I guess we should yeah make some 	ES2011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
853.06	kind of brainstorming , see what we can 	ES2011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
922.79	And if if you consider our budget , it probably if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . Yeah . Right so um yeah . 	ES2011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[h]
969.1	So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can right . 	ES2011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
998.61	So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . Huh . 	ES2011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1282.02	We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . 	ES2011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
72.54	Oh , let's kick it off . Oh , there we go . So , our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set , so , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I took this off our corporate website . It's I think well it sums up what we need to do . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
108.13	So we put the fashion in electronics . So that's what we need to go for . Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design . First step will be the functional design . And that's basically what we're gonna do . Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information about So I'm gonna keep this short , since we had a technical problem . So skip through this . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
128.91	Uh . Okay . Every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you have we have the SMARTboards here . We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's actually it's very easy . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
152.83	Like you see here , I'll just take the take here . That's it , you just put it on the board . You see a pen here . You go here , just like using a pen . You can just draw whatever you want . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
168.62	It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
173.06	And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
188.53	So it should be really easy . This is to take the just take a new slide and back again . We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will be it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . So I'll take this out . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
204.7	Okay . We'll use that later . Anyway . Yeah , just just just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now . I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
232.88	we have a blank sheet . Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
245.93	So , draw us your favourite animal . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
252.35	Draw us a technical animal . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
309.58	Let's go easy on it . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
353.28	Pick a pick a pick a clean sheet . Oh . Take a clean sheet first . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
360.58	Just press next . That's it . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
583.44	Do everything to Uh really small , but together they're really strong . So I'm gonna give it a smiley face . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
601.47	Think it need shoes . So 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
648.28	Just Yeah . You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct . Anyway . another beep to stop the meeting . See . Warning . Finish meeting now . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
666.35	Uh put this down . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
764.1	It should be light , okay . Um , let's see , where did I Let's skip that . Oh , this is it . Sorry , I skipped this sheet . What do we This Quick What we're going to Selling price , twenty five Euros . That's for you . The production price , twelve and a half Euros , approximately . Just go go for that . We'll reach the uh reach that profit . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[twelve, and, a, half]	[]	[Euros]
808.43	Anyways , the the personal coach will give you the your p your personal assignments and everything . So we'll just meet back in here thirty minutes . I'm sure we have that . 	TS3012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
736.97	Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . 	ES2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, V_C_R]
853.68	For instance , um let's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um 	ES2003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
521.26	Yep , okay , we can have soft excess . Mm-hmm . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
659.36	Let's keep flux in because it in most of these cases we've put flux in . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
822.49	I'll get this . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1078.95	You can point to the line wings . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1102.89	Mm you're right , star burst . Oh , star burst active star burst like activity , that's I don't think that's a class . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[star, star]
1155.0	I can see that . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1165.65	Okay . Let's keep it in . I I think you're right anyway . Mm-hmm . Yes , I think it was ma maybe if it was star forming like activity , that would be different . But yeah . Yes , that's right , but star burst is different . Okay . Um we've just got this split up . I think there should be w H_ 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma, star]
1224.13	Um hold on . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1230.22	Absorption line systems . Hubble . And hubble . And galaxy . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Hubble]
1265.12	Open that radius button . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1341.73	I thought we had , we'd put in 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1466.61	Radio quiet quasar should be go mm 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[quasar, mm]
1524.18	It should be the galaxy , I guess . Insert proper whatever the word is . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1600.26	Just keep H_ beta , I think . Given that we're not putting line width itself . Even line if it is line width . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1610.11	You can have flux . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1832.4	The C_T_I_O_ four metre telescope is must be what it's called . Otherwise they'd call it a name . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[C_T_I_O, _]
1884.31	So they do mean iron line . So so it should be in . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1892.23	Continuum flux we should have all in . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Continuum]
1966.71	Mm I'd put multiple in there . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2054.31	Yeah , you can point to that . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2322.76	You can point to ionized emission rather than 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2327.4	Hmm . Emission from high excitation lines . Yeah . It it's pointing there and saying , look , there's a high excitation emission . And there's not high excitation . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2439.0	Mm no , I think it's a spectral feature . You can point to the damped Lyman a alpha resorption , in in the same way you can point to H_ beta emission , although H_ beta emission is a process . Or emission from H_ beta is is a process . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Lyman, _, _]
2473.8	What did we do back 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2479.4	Mm you can point to low red shift damped Lyman alpha absorption 'cause you're shifted in the spectrum there . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Lyman]
2540.32	It's a process , but it also produces a spectral feature , where you can say there's the damped Lyman alpha absorption , there's the in the same way that the , yeah , H_ beta emission is a process . Yeah , I think it should be in there . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Lyman, _]
2576.34	But just talk about the micro-quasar . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2672.08	Because the acronym has star burst in it uh galaxies in it , in the S_ , and if the acronym includes its 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[S, _]
2853.7	F_V_ low BAL is a source type . Stupid Keckers . You used to b oh no , Keck observatory . Yes , we did decide Keck was going in . 	EN2006b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[BAL, Keckers, Keck, Keck]
98.52	But you can tell what they're about based on the other texts on the site , the texts on the things they're linked to , so what I wanted to know was can you combine the topic models that the pages , that have lots of text on them , with something else that that tells you what a page that has no or very little text on it based on the links , yeah . So quite simply if you have a page one which is like a home page , and that'll maybe have five links and a picture on it , and then because it links to page two and page three . 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
160.91	So I wanted to combine the topic models that tell you beforehand what you think this page and this page are about with this to maybe get a better idea . So the idea is say you've got some text on a page , that's only part of the picture about what of what the page is really about , and the links pointing to that page are also part of the picture . So I basically came up with an algorithm that's just a i it plugs P_L_S_A_ uh plugs page rank into P_L_S_A_ , right , so page rank you basically just d uh say 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[P_L_S_A, _]
237.32	I think this is roughly it off hand . Page rank of Z_ . So you say page rank of Z_ is equal to uh one over a constant to normalise it . Uh sum over all the links into Z_ of page rank 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Z, _, Z, _, Z]
281.03	uh is equal to , and you can use the same sort of thing . Right , so nicking a whole bunch of maths from how you work out page rank , uh it comes up with uh just uh an iterative algorithm , which is just uh the current probability of topic one given Z_ , so that's probability old plus uh 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[algorithm, Z]
319.93	So what you're saying is that a page is partly from its text that you've got on the page , and it's partly from what the links say it's about . So that alpha thing is how much do you trust the text on the page , and how much do you trust the links . So that alpha could be different for every page . 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
334.8	So what I did then was try this on a big database of web pages . Uh and I had some results from that , but they were all on temp two , so that's not important right now . Uh but as it is not really important , I can regenerate that . The problem was that this gives you a new vector of topics for every page . So you've got two vectors , you've got the one that you've just got from P_L_S_A_ or whatever model , and you've got the one that you get from this . 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[P_L_S_A]
503.81	you have the uh oh , let me thing of what this was . It was to do with cars basically , if you have you have a topic that's uh representing 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1133.92	Yeah , i it's the same thing , like it it does tell you whether this uh which clustering is better for this task , but it doesn't tell you which clustering better represents the pages necessarily . But it it's it you you could say that it possibly doe it probably does . 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1287.8	words in varying sizes representing the probability of that topic for example . Try give the user these pieces of paper to get an idea of what these topics are , that's this P_ of W_ given Z_ . And then you give them some pages , and say which one would you which piece of paper would you put that with , and then you get like an intuitive ide uh like how would a person cluster pages given the what these topics supposedly are . 'Cause i you've got something that's fixed , the the P_ of W_ given Z_ with respect to both models . So I was tr I was hoping you could use that to 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[W, Z, _, _, W, Z, _]
1388.85	See , the the thing about web pages I thought as well in that getting humans to evaluate it in some way is that you have most of the web pages that are uh well a lot of the web pages that are important in some way are are are home pages , so Google dot com doesn't actually say the words search on it , I think . I maybe it says go , but you only know it's about search through the thing , but someone looking at it can tell that it's a search engine , because of the way it's laid out , because of the pictures on it and because of all of that . There's a lot of information that's completely lost in this bag of words representation , and I was hoping that in some way you could use that to evaluate this . I have no idea how , but uh yeah . 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Google]
2097.38	Yeah , maybe do it by cross-validation , something . 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2166.88	Yeah , i so uh I I think that that's too easy . You can do it with some heuristics and you can learn it from the task results in or combine the two , so tha that's kinda straightforward , I think . 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2215.5	So the more pages you get , the better your results . And people running this style of algorithm , the page rank style stuff , generally run it on about two million or twenty million pages , or whatever . The the Stanford web base data set that I was using for this , for for a bit of this um , they have a a d I can't remember off hand , but they have m maybe a bit over a theta byte worth of web pages in this , a bunch of servers . Uh 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[algorithm, Stanford]
2688.86	So for example if you split a document into two parts and said that the two parts have to be close in the distribution , you can see how the doc t the document changes , for exa stu stuff based on that . 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[exa, stu]
2732.93	So it might actually be a better model again . I dunno . I'll send you guys the link for that correlated topic model stuff if you want , but uh I don't know if it's too interesting to you . 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2746.2	Okay . Alright , well than thanks for hearing me out and the idea especially . Maybe I can do more with this . Alright . 	IN1005.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
44.6	Just do it on the arrow . 	ES2010a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
688.52	Like statement , statement , reject , accept , you know , something like that . 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
977.73	So modelling modelling a single contribution by a single speaker , you can within that you can use R_S_T_ if you want to , right . But across speakers you can't . They have no relations for things like reject or agree . They the theory doesn't have them . 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_S_T]
1112.41	Uh p poss possibly , but few people have tried to , you know , do the kind of um truth conditional semantics that , you know , Asher and Lascarides have done , right . So the theory can handle the kinds of things that happen in meetings , as she explained . The actual computational mechanisms they have currently for building up the trees can't . Now I don't remember , was which speaker you in the c in the example she showed yesterday , was it the case that the representation of the utterances and the relations included which speaker was uh 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[yesterday]	[]	[Asher, Lascarides]
1219.28	For this specific set of relations that that they've defined . There might be some higher level structure that you wanna pull out of that . I mean I 'cause you were saying you're just gonna you you're you wanna look at this , you know , very local stuff . But from that you c one would hope you would pull out something high , you know 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
1291.29	try to find a theory that allows multiple speakers and relations to span over more than one spea you know . Because it is true that I mean if you look at things like damsel and other attempts to come up with annotation schemes for for dialogue acts , there was this notion of forward looking and backward looking . Anyway , they're relational . I mean in some way , you know , they're all relational . Um but you needed 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1429.71	Right , okay . D so I think it's much more impor I think it would make more sense to go about this problem figuring out what kinds of relationships we want and then finding and , you know , like setting down what the constraints are on the analysis game . He's been looking at the data , okay , s to good . Um and then and then there are lots of different theories of argument . I mean you can also think about the sort of joint problem solving kinds of um approaches . So you know , Clark and Lockbaum and , you know , that that kind of thing . That were designed for dialogue , right , I mean , and can be expanded to more than two persons . Actually the Lockbaum stuff is for groups . 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Clark, Lockbaum, Lockbaum]
2291.85	There are a lot of option there are a lot more options . So so let's see what what else you've got . 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2607.84	you may think that they're missing something , then we we could certainly augment them . But I think that they have to be looked at . And so so Nate Blaylock tried to okay , so you know , from Gross and Krauss and Gross and Sidener came all this stuff about shared plans and how you really can't understand , you know , dialogue u unless you understand shared plans . But the actual theoretical um or formalisation of it was incredibly complex . And so um Lockbaum simplified it quite and , you know , Sidener and Rich and Collagen have simplified it quite a bit . Um but Nate Blaylock tried to um , you know , define , 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[Krauss]	[Nate, Blaylock, Gross, Gross, Sidener, Lockbaum, Sidener, Rich, Collagen, Nate, Blaylock]
2654.91	you know , what happens after somebody suggests something . Well , you can adopt it , you can well I can't remember you know , okay , but he has uh he has a taxonomy yeah , right . 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2785.89	Mm-hmm . Yeah , th I mean it it does seem like , you know , there's something that we want from that and then there's something that we want from collaborative problem solving . And 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3335.39	tasks sort of put on , you know , sort of as part of the official agenda . So being able to answer questions like um were there any counter proposals to the bana you know , banana shape or whatever . Um uh or to some specific , you know , recommendation and things like that . I mean , you know , those , you know , strike me as cl clear things that , you know , people who go to decision making meetings want to know if they've missed one or are arriving late or anything like that . So it wou it seems like we should probably get some of these things on the official agenda and say look , you know , wouldn't it be nice if you could have answers to these questions , or something . 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[bana]
3720.71	So um I mean we'll we'll get that back on track . But I think that um we don't you know , there will be some meeting browser demo that um , you know I I think it's an interesting question of okay well , if you have knowledge , here's what you can do . If you don't have that knowledge 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3756.49	Well I think when he does re when he does lear these learning experiments , he should do 'em two ways . Because he will have this opportunity with or without . And then we can see like well without , you know , these tags so you know , Alex was showing um yesterday well without knowing the head word of the utterance at the leaf , you know , you get these kinds of results , and when you add that in , you get these other kinds of results . And you know , I think yeah . Um so I think if we have those features , it's , you know , it's a rare orp or rare opportunity that you can , you know , you can try one head to head against the other . Um and then of course to make sure that you really um 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[yesterday]	[]	[Alex]
3855.57	Sure , so we might find that when we move from what we thought was open domain , but on the hub , you know , our results go down when we truly are getting meeting yeah . So I mean that'll be interesting . 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3993.19	And I mean it seems to me that chunking should have some kind of so if if your dialogue act segmenter says there's there's a segment here , but your chunker said no , this is a coherent chunk , then y y you know , w I mean maybe they could work together to do a better job than 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[segmenter, y]
4114.52	Okay , if there if there was if there was hand labelled data that you could evaluate again so train on some and evaluate on some , wouldn't that um 'cause you've trained on Switchboard , right , where there there are chunks . So if you had some ICSI data that you could maybe use , I don't know , um as a what's the n there's t there's a training set and then there's the development set and then there's the test set . Maybe you'd use some chunked ICSI stuff as development or something and do some last tweaks and then evaluate . But you know , w h I mean I can see why Wei-Xun didn't wanna spend his time chunking ICSI d 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Switchboard, ICSI, ICSI, Wei, Xun, ICSI, d]
4348.13	um and see how different they are from tree-bank parses . And you might wanna talk to Alex to find out if somebody's already done this turn Redwoods stuff into tree-bank stuff so that they can compare , you know , against results that are reported on tree-bank . 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Alex]
4591.57	You know , I mean the typical thing is to do leave one out cross validation with , you know , eighty nine dialogues . Okay , so I trained on eighty eight and then or I train on one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and Okay , but we should speak to Steve . We might have some um 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Steve]
4641.45	Well we'd wanna make sure we're pretty happy that it's reliable because 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4855.59	I can send you a l 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
5072.24	they did they had done a lot of questionnaires , and they got some user requirements out of that . And then Steve presented um the results of following people around and looking at how they used their notes from meetings . And and so that would give us some ideas about , you know , what people want , you know , out of meeting records . But then we should also add things that we think are interesting . But just to have to keep some of these goals in mind 'cause they're t o one scheme might let you answer this set of questions but wouldn't help you at all with another set of questions . 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Steve]
5164.96	And Steve m and his I've forgotten the name , is it was it Simon , his yeah . They they've I think they may have written this up um in a report um , but I wou would hope that's on the work package six web site as well . 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Steve, Simon]
5193.89	I do as i once he's read a couple more I mean he's just completely missed out the collaborative problem solving world , which I d I really think we need to take into account . I mean you may take it into account and say no , you're wrong , and here's why , but I I I'm gonna need some convincing . 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
5231.46	I think this is gonna take about three weeks 'cause he's got plenty of reading to do . So maybe we get together again in the yeah , I mean , I'll send them the references immediately . 	EN2005a.D.words.xml	True	[about, three, weeks]	[]	[]
33.3	Okay . Hi Team . Hope you had a good lunch . Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting . Um let's get started . 	ES2010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Team]
61.48	'Kay , and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control . 	ES2010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
826.04	Hmm . Okay . Alright , well thank you for those informative presentations . Let's go back to um Now we have to make some decisions . 	ES2010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
948.13	Okay , that kind of brings us to this , let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . Um . 	ES2010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1109.14	No . Oh what did you Oh sorry , go ahead . 	ES2010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1153.28	remotes . If this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , I think . 	ES2010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1206.87	They could buy cases , maybe , 	ES2010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1332.91	Could it run off of two 	ES2010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1635.34	I can find it again . 	ES2010c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
174.88	It depends which data you use as well because um if you use the data where they're all really high , it does prefer ones from the beginning because it just picks the first ones it finds . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
189.38	But I'll check it out anyway . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
230.72	Yeah . I've got time now . Like um for the next couple of days I'll do some on it , 'cause I was just too busy last week . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[the, next, couple, of, days, last, week]	[]	[]
540.12	So maybe we should just omit them then . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
566.54	Okay , so maybe we should leave them out then . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
802.0	Having said that , it's picking out some interesting stuff . Like we're looking at atlas , you'd expect to score quite high . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[atlas]
864.69	Yeah , I'll do the first thing I'll do is make a load box for selecting a file 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
886.98	But we'll have parameter for that . Yeah . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
976.01	I can rope people in to to doing it , a few people at least . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1023.55	We should probably write some user documentation 'cause I bet that will get us marks . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1029.96	Yeah , they'd love that kind of stuff . Just we'll just write , you know , little help files or something . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1084.93	Okay . Well we should wait till we have it ready for um you guys to use . Then we'll put it back in the group directory . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1094.66	So I'll try and do that today . 'Cause I've got time today . And as long as I don't run into problems I don't see it taking too long . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[today, today]	[]	[]
1176.82	Hopefully we can take over that right one 'cause we don't need it . That'd be quite nice . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1222.75	Can you send me a link to that paper so that I'll implement that in summarizer . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1327.84	I I'm pretty confident that it'll just be writing a script and it will just go . And as long as I can test the script like once and it's working fine , I can just make it return dummy stuff so it works on other machines . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1354.41	I can change the script . So if I'm using my one at home , I can just add S_S_H_ stuff in to ev evoke the sound tools on the uh on DICE and then copy 'em back . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[S_S_H, _, DICE]
1413.76	If it comes to it , I'll just um install NetBeans and stuff on my Linux machine and work on that . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Linux]
1743.38	Um , oh there must be a way of detecting whether the clock's loaded . Like in fact there there is . You can try and set something on the clock and use try and catch , and then if you catch the exceptions set the flag . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1813.79	We could put those on display . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1891.65	As long as you can skip more accurately than the time steps , that's fine . 'Cause otherwise you might risk cutting bits off . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1902.89	Like if you want to jump to a point , you need to be able to jump more accurately than half second . By half second you'll miss words . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[accurately, than, half, second]	[]	[]
1938.77	Oh yeah , I can yeah , I can do that . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2156.04	Obviously we'll hide that in the presentation . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2209.33	So you can have happy faces and angry faces . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2277.77	Oh right , okay . So I could probably I could probably read it from uh that file already . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2285.66	My preferred would be dialogue act number , then you can put both the scores in one file . You can put both the scores in one file if it makes it easier . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2306.25	So I'll read that into um I'll make it part of the get measure thing . So you can just get it with a flag 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2506.13	'Cause we on the display we probably take quite high . So it'd only matter if it occurs on ones that are really highly ranked . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2528.39	Yeah . Well otherwise you'd get icons all over the place . So anyway 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2593.06	Yeah , and see how it turns out . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2640.16	So yeah , we'd probably want to merge ones that were very close into one . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2654.73	Yeah , and we should probably make some logic when it displays it that says if there's ones very close together , it just centres it among the 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2832.39	Yeah , I mean see how it turns out . If they look good , then that's a good way of doing it as any , I suppose . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2912.87	Just draw a big black line on the borders , I think . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2925.05	'Cause it ju it can display from any utterance to any other utterance . It doesn't really 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3027.99	knowledge it would need . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3033.97	But anyway , we can sort that out if we have time once we've got everything else . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3046.32	That'll get s s sufficient to claim that we had implemented some kind of zoom as well . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
3099.07	Basically do a code for ease on it . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3104.12	Um I'll probably tonight just work on getting a frozen version that works consistently . And um if you could document it for me , that's probably enough for me to add it in . Unless you want to do it . But my code , I've not documented the programme manager class . So though it's a bit hairy at the moment , isn't it . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3175.22	detect where the mouse is and change the default tool tip for that component . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3210.69	I'll have a look through some of my Java books 'cause it might be the sort of thing they have in there . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Java]
3243.76	Okay . Cool . So I'll start working on that in like half an hour or something and it will be the 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3325.19	That'd be handy . Yeah , we can get them . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3437.15	I we maybe you should present it on your laptop 'cause we can be really sure it's running before we come . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3449.67	I could probably get my computer in if I could get someone to give me a lift . I know a couple of people with cars . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3513.0	In Cygwin . No , but Cygwin should run um the Java as well . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Cygwin, Cygwin, Java]
3566.87	Yep , I'll do that today . And I'll yeah , I'll make a script to run it and put that in the group directory . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
3574.44	And I'll send around the email when it's done . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3770.92	Uh and also the real time and play time stuff would change . So we , yeah , we need to re-initialize the display then , don't we . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3815.49	So may we probably want a different summary constructor that takes an an additional argument of an I_D_ . And it will that w utterance will always be in the summary . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[I_D]
3869.71	But you could d you can um achieve the same effect . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3881.62	Probably the way to handle that would be to make a summary that's the same length as the selection , and that would ensure that the search term came up . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3927.88	Yeah . But we'll have that slider obviously . 	EN2001e.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
32.64	Let's see . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
35.95	First I will introduce myself . I don't know if uh if everybody knows me , so I'm Bart , hello . Hello . Bart . Hello . Hello . Bart . Welcome . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bart, Bart, Bart]
50.14	Uh let's see . Uh let's start off um with a little presentation . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
106.87	Is being modified by the administrator . Uh okay . Let's do it read only . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
149.67	Uh maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or Let's see . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
332.18	Then we've got our first tool training . We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . Here are some functions . You can save . N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ab, white, board, white, board, undo]
363.9	uh piece of drawing . A blank new document for each person . Uh select a pen , eraser . Capture we don't have to do anything with . Uh then we've got our pen . This pen . It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of . You can also select the current colour and the line width . But then first you have to select the pen function . But we're going to work with it in a minute . So okay . Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there .

439.41	Here is a simple tool bar . It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . You can switch between the different drawings . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
456.78	So as you can see we g all going to draw a animal . Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it . Mouse wasn't running away . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mouse]
478.29	And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . Uh there's I can start from now . I will . You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
543.62	Uh , see you have to do it real slow . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
584.94	Woah . Now we've got another function . We've got the eraser . And then you can undo 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
700.24	It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin . It lives for the fun . So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . Go ahead . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
843.07	Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere . On just a 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1111.25	move along to the project finance . Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Our selling price . Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros . Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . Uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . Um but that's all in the later stadium . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
1284.68	Yep . Yeah I've I've got one at home . And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor . So that's a pretty handy um 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1339.89	Yeah , that's nice , I think . So we've we want different functions 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1346.76	uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs . So that uh that's something we have to find out , I think . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1370.4	Maybe we can make it uh uh 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1389.76	Okay . So these are our um a few things we can think of . Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1443.76	Okay , then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1449.35	and then we can all work . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1451.74	Finish meeting now . Okay . And we can all work uh on our own projects . 	TS3003a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
10.9	Uh let me see . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
26.73	Okay . Roo , welcome back . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
61.75	Okay . Okay . People , welcome back with the second meeting . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
111.66	Um we will figure that out . Ca can you try to 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
118.08	Yeah , w we will see . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
124.07	Yeah . Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
209.33	then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Roo]
386.53	Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
788.63	Yeah , that's definitely interesting . It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . Okay , go on . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1009.99	Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , because that's his his field of expertise . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sebastian]
1116.39	Okay . Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1287.53	Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1298.29	Yeah , draw draw it on the board . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1327.96	Yeah , it can break down . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1424.68	Um well , for we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah . We need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1552.44	And and do we want um 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1594.34	But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1620.56	You c you can d make them very fancy by um 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1673.35	To find yeah . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1683.75	If if we would um drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume , because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1701.0	Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2041.71	well , I think we're qui quite done . Um for now we will have the lunch break . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2090.29	I'm sorry , yeah , I'm sorry . User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept . And um 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer, Roo, c]
2142.8	We can decide the next meeting . Yep . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2162.18	uh will change , adapt and um so we will see that . Um yeah , that's it for now . 	TS3011b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
640.98	No . I'll add it later , I guess the presentation . 	ES2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
769.85	Nope . Try that again . 	ES2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
774.0	Wait . 	ES2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
801.44	Increase that 'cause we can't see the 	ES2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1327.84	Um , but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . So maybe we should I suggest that we think about speech recognition , anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . 	ES2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1414.22	Sorry , do you mind passing me my notepad . Thanks . 	ES2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1477.09	Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , so I'll go into the diagram first . It just explains how the process goes through , from a from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . Um okay , you need some power source . 'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want . Like for example , voice recognition , right . That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there . Um 	ES2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
1787.93	There's a there's Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . Or you need to get the user to plug it in . Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about . Um . 	ES2002b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
142.83	You can write on the paper , yeah . It's it's okay . 	IN1013.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
59.14	sen oh stand-by . Close the the window . 	TS3011a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sen]
662.88	You should feed that uh that animal . 	TS3011a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
904.5	Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so 	TS3011a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1027.14	Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um 	TS3011a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sebastian]
1110.95	Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device . It just should change the T_V_'s state . So that's it . Um but furthermore 	TS3011a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1161.1	Yeah . And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , so you must point everywhere , so maybe infrared is 	TS3011a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, T_V]
1225.63	You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand . You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think . And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um in dark too . So when it's dark 	TS3011a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[al]
1344.64	Yeah . Well , maybe I um but it it can be quite simple , you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it . The uh the the digits in black . Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy well , it can be for design , of course . 	TS3011a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1384.9	Just remind something . The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade . You have a m uh 	TS3011a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
285.96	You can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss . Ok oh we do we do . Don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway . 	ES2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
354.91	I was gonna choose a dog as well . But I'll just draw a different kind of dog . M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . Um 	ES2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
394.87	Um he's a mixture of uh various things . Um and what do I like about him , um That's just to suggest that his tail wags . Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate and um 	ES2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
433.83	It is . I think it is . He only does it after he's had his dinner and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room . 	ES2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
524.21	the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um . 	ES2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
565.13	Yeah . Well for a remote control , do you think that will be I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is . 	ES2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
772.8	Five minutes to end of meeting . Oh , okay . We're a bit behind . 	ES2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
843.99	Or even like , you know , notes about um what you wanna watch . Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a Oh that's a good idea . So extra functionalities . 	ES2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
977.17	Right , well um so just to wrap up , the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it so y you know what you're doing there . Um for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . Um and uh marketing executive , 	ES2002a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
827.97	Power source over here . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . 	ES2010b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[red]
887.85	So you can put it in the dark . 	ES2010b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1012.23	You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so 	ES2010b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1137.63	Most of them will intuitively pick it up though . 	ES2010b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
538.56	Yeah . Yeah , I'm quite keen to do like most of that . Like make an index search and stuff . 	EN2001d.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1081.99	Um it p it'd probably select it , yeah . It would make sense to do that . 	EN2001d.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1109.17	Yeah , yeah . If yeah , if if you can pass me like the dialogue act with 	EN2001d.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1408.46	Yeah , I suppose you could calculate them off-line and just , yeah , have a like like a l little thumbnail or something . 	EN2001d.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1417.89	Yeah . I mean it would be a bit pointless , but it would look good for the presentation . Yeah . I suppose . 	EN2001d.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1737.88	Yeah , I did say that . 	EN2001d.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1751.49	Yeah , he did give us eight out of ten though . 	EN2001d.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2313.44	Remember how did I do it . 	EN2001d.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3341.21	Yeah , I'll be working on the search , I think . It's ready to get started . Yeah , I may as well come and you can show me how it the manager works . 	EN2001d.E.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
394.77	We can take the tram and a train . It's it's all conditioned . Yeah . 	IN1012.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
563.68	Maybe I can find it . 	IN1012.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
576.4	Make it possible to use uh a full covariance matrix . 	IN1012.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
670.18	No , but in the proceedings you can find them . They are better , yeah . They tried P_C_A_ , L_D_A_ , M_L_L_T_ . 	IN1012.D.words.xml	True	[]	[M_L_L_T]	[P_C_A, _, L_D_A, _]
1359.4	Yeah , ho yeah . How did you cope with what you mentioned some time before , that if it's a very long session for each twelve point five frame you will actually get the same segment now . So how d 	IN1012.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ho]
2023.91	So maybe well , but then well no , if somebody like NIST will have one recogniser and you just plug a different feature , but uh it's dangerous . 	IN1012.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[NIST]
2517.47	But there you could send an S_M_S_ I think , or something like that . Uh you could dictate text , so . On a phone , yeah . 	IN1012.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
64.43	Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh just as vital to this project um I'll just go round th the table , Andrew , marketing , um m Kendra with the uh um designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . Um . 	ES2012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Andrew, Kendra, User, Interface, Kate]
117.39	everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for a while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh uh everybody's experience is please do so . Uh 	ES2012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
153.32	in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make . So we'll start with Andrew . 	ES2012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Andrew]
324.99	The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production . 	ES2012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
385.58	So I I everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal . 	ES2012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
616.08	Yeah d no I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control , people won't see it as a remote control um and uh 	ES2012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
719.28	fi find the button buttons easily . 	ES2012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
729.96	Yeah , that's uh must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's uh certainly be different . Um do we need it to uh I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all . Do we do we want uh 	ES2012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1079.75	start looking at the um at the design in more detail . Um 	ES2012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1091.93	then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh 	ES2012a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
208.3	Hold that . 	IS1000a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
703.49	So do cats . And you guessed cats without a tail . 	IS1000a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
813.44	You got a lot of room here . You can probably reach . 	IS1000a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1368.18	Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use . 	IS1000a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1413.11	So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to 	IS1000a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
166.45	Okay . So uh uh yeah . I will do something like that . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
172.57	Okay . So uh I would like just to review at the different project regarding acquisition system . So basically there are five systems . The first one is called SMAC , which is developed by Fribourg and CERN . The second one i is your system . Uh I would to say the cheap meeting room system . The third one yeah , maybe I can share that with you . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Fribourg]	[SMAC, CERN]
210.83	The first one is yeah , I will call that A_ . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[A, _]
281.85	D_I_V_A_ , something like that . The third one is call uh the third one is uh the project that I have to improve the current smart meeting room at IDIAP . Uh for that we will use um uh 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_I_V_A, IDIAP]
300.64	Yeah , a tape three uh okay , let's call that . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
341.33	Okay . So I will start just with the SMAC . So maybe I draw line here . So the SMAC 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[SMAC, SMAC]
396.3	On these four inputs you can have only video . But uh they want to make also the slide acquisition . So on one input they put um a conversion box , a converter , which converts from slide 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
414.88	to video . So that mean that we decrease uh the the quality . We have a high quality in slide and we go to low quality to lower quality with uh video . Um so this one is just for the SMAC . Now I will just move . D 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[SMAC]
434.12	Yeah . These one are just for video and audio . You can use uh them . And this board does uh the DivX compression on the fly . This is uh the box that we have on the table . The the card that we have on the table . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[DivX]
889.24	Okay . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . So we can have both . We can have the slide from the slide capture and we can just use uh a video signal to to capture that also . To have two t uh mm you wants to ha do you have two quality h high quality and 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
921.24	Yeah , we can just take some snapshots . Yeah . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
963.06	Yeah . Yeah . Something like like say something like that . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1013.49	Okay . So uh I was just talking about the PAS project . Maybe I would like just now to talk about the DIVA project . So I clean up . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PAS, DIVA]
1084.91	And the same for this one . And um basically on the slave machine we have two cards , one for audio and one for video . So they develop something to synchronize these two cards together and th uh this is something which is it's more , w which is call uh direct show , 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1210.32	I will write . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1230.92	Okay . So maybe first I will just describe the ma the smart meeting room that we have at IDIAP . In fact we have uh also a master slave architecture . Um I clean a little bit . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma, IDIAP]
1279.66	If we look at the video in fact um yeah , maybe first I should mention that . Between the master and the slave we have um the mm a synchronization signal which is call time MIDI time code . I just write MIDI . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm, MIDI, MIDI]
1344.73	um uh a video slave machine . May I say something like that , yeah , a video slave machine uh which use the MIDI um which use also the MIDI time code . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[MIDI, MIDI]
1369.46	We have the video here . We just have the time code inserter . So we take that signal here and we move to this uh machine here , which is in fact just uh the I_V_C_ video card . This just an acquisition card . And we com and we s and we convert file directly to DivX . And um so we will have here video . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[I_V_C, _, DivX]
1630.35	Uh this is uh I just want to to describe here the bus . This uh yeah , this is of the bus where you can send you can send some package . And any device we which wants to send a package a p a packet , sorry , should ask um there is a manager of that bus . This just of the bus . Any device which wants to send a packet has to r to r 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1661.55	uh require some uh band-width on the bus on the bus . And so after that he will have that band-width . And he will always have that band-width . So um yeah , he will always have that band-width . And so we are sure that we will have a synchronize acquisition with fire-wire . And so so that mean that um 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1707.87	It's i it's done by it's done by hardware . It's done by hardware . No no no no no . And in fact yeah . I I as I mentioned before , we have a bus manager and the bus manager send just a flag to say now it's time to give me you data , and all devices which have uh required some band-width will send the data . So I'm just drawing something like that . This is this kind of signal that the th bus manager is sending . And just after that bus just after that uh signal all device will send uh the data . So we will have the data from A_ , from B_ and from C_ and so on . And after the next one we will have again the um 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[width, A, _, B, _, C]
1759.92	the data from A_ , B_ and C_ and so on and so on . And so with fire-wire we are sure to have a um an acquisition system . Now the major problem with fire-wire is that that fire-wire is just an kind of intelligent , uh a smart pipe . A synchronized pipe . We can put what we want inside . So we can put raw data , or we can send a DivX data , or we can send also uh what I uh was presenting in my term presentation was a H_ two six four . But in that case we need something uh hardware here to uncode raw data to a given format . Of course uh the idea is to reduce um the band-width on the bus also . And all data are sent through the master . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[A, _, B, _, C, DivX]
1816.49	Do you have any quest 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2051.09	Usually audio audio and video should be synchronized . Because uh this just an on an audio video channel . So uh they are synchronize . Um so we can play with the video . We can play with the slide . Uh and after that and the major point is to m combine both . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2315.14	Maybe a first so solution will be just to start w with . Because we need to start with something . We have the slide capture from Darren . We have um I will work on the video acquisition for the inpu the tape free smart meeting room . So I will start with that to develop some knowledge regarding that board , uh that video board , and after that we can combine both . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Darren]
2433.35	For myself I would like to say uh April , May . April , May we should have results . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[April, ,, May, April, ,, May]	[]	[]
2557.79	Uh I_V_C_ I_V_C_ should go faster . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[I_V_C]	[]	[_, I_V_C, _]
2622.91	But I would like to say uh there is many unknown in that project . But I would like to say we can make uh uh a schedule of that project to just to track to just to see if we track the time table . If we don't we we asks for more people , maybe H_E_V_S_ people , to to to be slightly involved in that project , to be to to respect the date . 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[H_E_V_S, _]
2994.26	No , I will work fully on that on this point . From January two thousand six I wi 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[January, two, thousand, six]	[]	[]
3331.42	Yeah . But I think yeah , that will be good , just to have a plan and to have some deadline in that plan . And as soon as we we we as soon as we we we are not in time , we we we con 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3424.94	Yeah , and to improve the system like 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3567.33	Yeah . Uh if I if I say until January this is just to finish . Uh I want to have the deadline at end of December to finish all my project . I want to finish all these project when everything is finished . After that I can move to another one . But I don't want to 	IN1014.B.words.xml	True	[January, December]	[]	[]
548.35	Uh I was just um let's talk about little about this presentation itself , the slide number six . 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
624.12	Kind of let's say idea is usually hundred milliseconds or one second . 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
690.1	Yeah , and then I then I would have taken two years extension . Yeah , it was it was pretty scary , but let's see what happens . 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[two, years]	[]	[]
776.08	Yeah , because even to download that much of data 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
883.36	And then we we need to train the new rates because M_L_P_ training needs to be done , and then only the next step will happen . 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
892.21	So it's it's pretty pretty hol holding is stupid . Whether we can replicate the results , whatever results you are showing , whether we can replicate them or not . Presently it's it's not known . 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1059.39	So you tha M_L_P_ needs to be trained and uh P_L_P_ features , so it's kind of one and a half days work , kind of , to generate the new files . 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[one, and, a, half, days]	[]	[_]
1144.96	So RAID five you have told to the 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1290.6	No no , insurance can take care of uh means anything can be insured in this world nowadays . 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1481.62	No no no , first they'll give you a quotation . The they won't go we ho without that . It's not means it's a wrong information . 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1490.23	Yeah yeah , because in the beginning what they say that send us the thing , we'll look at the things . If it is recoverable , we will tell you what is the quotation , and if it is not recoverable , we will send it back to you . 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1519.71	Yeah . Means looking at uh how much failure has happened . Accordingly they will tell you whether they can recover or not . 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1983.94	Uh they'll get a shock of their life . 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2033.34	If they can yeah , if they can give me my C_ files , then also it's okay . 	IN1002.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
224.61	I'll buy it . If I if I need so . Hopefully my daughter will like it . 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
396.9	You mean we can change the colour uh of th 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
498.48	It's my turn . Mm-hmm . Let's see if this Yeah , if you meet 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
540.2	As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
602.26	So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
685.83	Change colour , I mean that's very 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
850.28	I would say then uh 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1145.47	Say no . No , ne never install . 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ne]
1203.95	Let's do a single curve . 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1323.72	It should stay . Yeah . 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1375.38	We can just use this red . It's 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1448.36	So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , we only We we win one . That's already that . Okay , let's do that . 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1486.78	No . Okay , let's see . 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1491.35	Yeah , yeah , yeah , if Click somewhere , you'll see features . Yes , it does . 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Click]
1536.41	Uh , it's better . I think they are counting uh We would prefer , yeah . Maximum is maximum . So , remove one of them . Yeah . Okay . Okay , we're uh on target . 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Maximum]
1560.88	Trick . Uh , I would say it's the Russian trick , but Anyway No , they may have some their origins , strange origins 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Trick]
1583.71	No , no , no . Let's finish this meeting instead . 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1630.77	Yeah , I think we've listened to everybody . Everybody could say what they thought . 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1657.2	Team-work , very strong , I would say . Team-work , no problem . 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1794.55	So , let's celebrate . Uh 	IS1006d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
15.21	Well should we just go around and everyone says what they d what they've been doing , how far they've got . Well I hope so . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
50.38	So yeah . We've go a browser we've um which comes up automatically with a transcription box and the topics . And then when you go on the menu , you can select a summarisation box , which pops up , and an audio player . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
68.79	Um and a s I think the search works as well , so you could pop up a search . And it loads up um just the background window is empty and um so when you start , you have to either open open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
170.64	So right-click on at menu , you know , and you can click on speaker characterisation , up pops the window . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
272.71	Yeah , so y when you right-click on it , one one option will be give me all your meetings , characterise the speaker 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
366.96	Yeah . Yes . So should we try try to do a right-click when you then 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
511.77	Especially if you have a touch-pad . It just goes oh . Well I'll I'll check what it does on on um double-click at the moment . 'Cause I think it might do something . But but yeah , mm but I don't I don't I d really don't see anything obvious that that would 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
532.32	I mean if you can think of something that 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
569.35	Yeah , okay , yeah , yeah . I mean we might use them while wo to work with them , but do we wanna integrate them in so that when you browse you can here's 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
631.0	Probably not , no . Yeah . Two or three maybe , but yeah . But yeah , it depends , I mean I I really wanna put the summary in somewhere , you know . And the summary for example is typical . You open the window , you read through it , you might click on you know , close it again straight-away . But it'd be good to have it there . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
691.93	I can have a look . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
756.37	Yeah , you can minimise 'em . Yeah , yeah . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
925.57	'Kay . Right , well I'll make that readable then . Um so the directory is my number 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
1106.73	I mean you should look at look have a look at the the browser code then , because um , you know , they already extract for example transcripts . Put it into a window at least . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1247.37	To get the data i for example to get the summarisation data , you have to search for I think the I_D_s or something . Yeah . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1277.55	Oh it does load up quite quickly . So you know , it's not too bad . But you know , you could have a look at them . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1379.32	Yeah , just search for a specific string . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1385.39	So you could just , you know , you could use that when you if you wanna um take the data out and put it somewhere . Yeah . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1396.68	If you have a a question about w what the p the code means or where to find the code that you wanna , you know , whatever you wanna do , then just send me an email . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1406.84	I can explain it . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1499.32	You do . Well , I'll do that then . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1647.82	Weeks will go by and 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[Weeks]	[]	[]
1684.44	Then we can write about it in the in the interim report , and s you know , and then we've got something to show . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1710.85	Maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you wanna be able to search for . And then if you want , you can give that to me and I'll I'll build a u nice , you know , a few tick-boxes and drop-down menus . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1791.35	That would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1810.62	Know 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1829.7	Yeah . Yeah , I can do that . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1832.47	Show you what bits the code 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1862.74	Pick a time . I I you know , let me know , whenever . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1968.07	I just think it's better to do it afterwards . Then we have all the time we need . Rather than have half an hour and then we'll surely run out . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2047.21	Okay . Let's meet Monday . 	EN2002a.C.words.xml	True	[Monday]	[]	[]
338.62	Um whatever you give me I can do it , I think . I mean um 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
421.22	Um the one present . Although we could do th mm we could do the one highlighted I suppose . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
672.25	Yeah . Well , let me know when when it's sort of usable . Or at least 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
756.9	Well just just tell me when , because I usually I usually work on my own copy for for the day and then update it without checking if th if the one in the one in the shared one has changed . So Okay . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
772.08	Yeah , let me know . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
811.59	Yeah . Actually for um um for an N_ text area , whatever it is , um they they defined some ha handy highlights on that . So you've got different different highlights . You've got just look at the the what they wrote about it . They've got like user highlights , um selection highlights , time highlights and 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[N]
849.03	That's the way I did it to to highlight , to cross-highlight between topic and then transcripts . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1009.3	Yeah . So do we want yeah , maybe we could write an on like the whatever it's called , the the top of the window saying welcome to the meeting browser . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1051.45	Yeah . I mean I think they should have two options , either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search . And through that , once you've got the results , you click on something and that loads up the first 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1507.79	Alright . Because that would be really handy then , we can actually test it on the user , as opposed to just doing it and not using it . 'Cause if you just have the segmentation , that's great , but we can't we can't compare it to the to the uh hand annotated , you know , the hand segmented tool . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1548.48	Yeah , that would work . That'd be really nice . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1595.18	Sort of , but then the main idea was more like to to speed it up , speed the search up , because N_X_T_ over the over the whole of the corpus was just not feasible . But it would be 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[N_X_T]	[_]
1633.67	Yeah , I mean if you have time . Do that as well , that'd be really nice , yeah . 'Cause I mean then then it would give you like if you searched for a word , it would give you the the meetings , but also how often the w that word occurred in that meeting . That would be so useful . Yeah . Yeah , exactly . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
1662.54	Yeah , but it would be useful if you yeah . You know , you c if you have a if if you search for language and you return like , you know , basically all of the meetings , you wanna see where they actually spoke about it and where they just mentioned it once . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
1878.75	Yeah , just to give them an idea , general idea what there is and so they can pick a a to um a meeting . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1902.17	Yeah , or w you kn yeah . I wanna look at the meeting where so-and-so spoke um of that , you know , sort of some sort of research group . I want that first meeting . Look at that . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1977.61	Have a user model . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2081.52	Yeah , or search , yeah . S and both of those we have and 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2428.6	Yeah . Yeah , something like that . I mean uh I think I'm gonna do quite a bit of work this week , so I'll have probably more to talk about . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[this, week]	[]	[]
2448.43	If you like . Well , we can disc uh discuss that on Friday if we have one . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[Friday]	[]	[]
2531.17	Well three o'clock , let's say three o'clock for now . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2544.14	Right . I'll write um I'll write this meeting up and I'll send it to Pernilla as well . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pernilla]
2635.46	I think it would . Yeah . I think I think it w it would it would give you the most relevant result . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2658.28	No , but for things like if you search for language , then you might have you have some topics which have as a , you know n some some meetings which have as a topic language , they specifically speak about language , and they use that word like in every sentence . And then you've got those that just mention , you know , mention it briefly , like once or twice saying , you know , my language is German or something stupid that you don't really want . So you wanna distinguish those somehow . Or would be nice anyway . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2693.26	Uh for multiple terms we can just do something really simple . I mean 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2720.28	Yeah , just just just disregard it , yeah . Yeah , I mean you'd you'd just do it really simply , you know . You'll have the results as before , but yeah , yeah . Can discuss it on Friday . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[Friday]	[]	[]
2858.5	Well we'll discuss it again on Friday . 	EN2002c.A.words.xml	True	[Friday]	[]	[]
104.21	Okay . So uh , if you could open the PowerPoint presentation . I'm number two . 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
131.65	Right here , is that little that one , yes please . Thank you . I'll take the mouse . 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
292.47	So , this is our finding . And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we're we're currently uh proposing , uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , but uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . And um then there was the regular which I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
442.13	Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting . 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
515.94	And you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
604.02	It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething . 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
980.77	No , f go to findings . 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1100.37	You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball , and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand . 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1121.09	To t an and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1131.23	Yes you'd know what kind of wood to get . 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1143.75	Oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect , yeah . 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1186.72	We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna um learn about um labour laws . 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1200.0	You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries . So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device . 	IS1008c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
765.8	I'll explain myself here now in the sense that uh 	IS1008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
785.69	Now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive , but give them added things that they don't have now , then it w it could possibly sell . Obviously the risk is there . 	IS1008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
855.45	So maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's a beep beep beep , and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home . 	IS1008b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
871.35	But if it's trendy , if it's fancy , it's got some colour to it , if it's very easy easy to use , if it's got simple remote speech remote uh control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause I can't turn the T_V_ on . 	IS1008b.D.words.xml	True	[half, a, day]	[]	[]
167.42	Yeah , we could because this could be just some uh a little just just describe some screen-shots or something . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
183.61	Yeah , you can either have and we can just ignore that bit . Or you can have 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
191.59	Yeah , you can either have the Yeah , it says screen-shot there and stuff . But th you can either have screen-shots by the thing , each one , or um have just a bunch of 'em in one session . It doesn't 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
222.75	Uh it should be alright . Do we d 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
264.08	Th you can you can perfect it and 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
286.21	Sleep , sleep , food , sleep . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
311.35	Sabotage it . Yeah . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
392.95	than worry about 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
415.33	Yeah , that's a good idea . You have should have a section probably . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
472.98	Give me a week and I'll tell you the answer to that . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[a, week]	[]	[]
479.0	Or maybe the speaker characterisation might get slimmer . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
508.61	The topic segmentation with the L_C_ seg and text tiles basically done . It just needs to be done because you know what I mean , the co yeah , tuned , yeah . A search through the parameters or something . Let's see what happens . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C]
700.71	Easy , yeah . Just yeah , well it just um when he pulls up the segments um part of that , one of the f one of the attributes you do get attributes . get attributes , it returns a list of attributes . Search through those and and then it just you can that will tell you what attributes it's got . And then you can either do it automatically or you can just hard-code and say , look , get me the time stamps . So you just say um get attribute and put I think it's I think the method's called get attribute and just it's called start time and end time . And that will tell you the start times and end times . I think it returns it double . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
756.4	That should uh tell you what it is . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1213.98	You will very much limit what you can do with it if it's not in X_M_L_ format . There is some bizarre method that puts things back into X_M_L_ format . But 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L, _, X_M_L, _]
1233.12	Oh , select what we want , just take bits of the X_M_L_ and take only it takes certain segments . Yeah . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L]
1257.89	Then written to a written to a file . I kinda doubt just that it would ever be done . But that will mean that you can only do things on actually no uh , 'cause you need to do things on word level . So yeah , that's fine . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1312.41	Yeah . Then it will look ugly probably , 'cause it will look just black and white . Unless you want as dark colouring . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1452.83	So if we can do it with NITE stuff , do it with NITE stuff , I think . Otherwise , you're gonna be s Java , trying to do s it was just so complicated it was ridiculous . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Java, s]
1625.6	You might lose a bit of continuity if you do that , though . That's what I was thinking . But sometimes it's easier to have the top it in its own its sections , if you see what I mean . So you talk about speaker characterisation , you say what you've done and 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1727.42	You stick it together . She'll shine it . 	EN2002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
472.25	Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, li]
502.46	Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen . 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
626.15	And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them . 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Word]
748.37	It you put uh put a black front on it or something . 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
943.55	The average will uh come later . 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
979.42	Out . That's easy . Kick it out . Yeah . 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
997.31	It's just extra . Kick it out . 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1105.53	You can make you can make it cheaper . But if you don't sell 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1183.47	people might buy . 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1526.16	Yeah , think so too . 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1553.88	Yeah , but you ca This is just a beamer function . And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1581.44	Yeah , but give me a beamer . That's uh that's much uh much cheaper . 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1669.71	That Stefan use . 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Stefan]
1780.56	For people who uh sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful . 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1824.45	Yeah , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , yeah , very precise 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2034.17	Do that . 	TS3009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
117.15	Yeah , I have actually yeah , the we can see the report here and the demo , and the goal of uh this meeting is to present the video shot detector to Olivier , okay . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Olivier]
209.61	So this detector uh detected the thirty shots , and if you click on uh plus button you can expand it and see the key frames that are in fact uh five extracted frames from the shot . But I think th uh as it is , it's t extracted uh without uh using sub-shots , uh it's simply uh five down-sam yeah , down-sampling . Um so I we can see the video actually , uh the entire video , can open with Real Player . I hope it will work . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Real, Player]
414.36	Yeah , maybe to explain this method was using uh a simple uh uh distance between uh consecutive histograms , and we didn't use motion features at all for that , that's why i we 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
493.76	I can show you uh 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
712.66	Okay , set the beginning . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
787.71	But if you are in the maximum already and at this point we check simply if uh this value is alpha times the the max of the other points , let's say these points here . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
898.17	It is uh okay . This is IDIAP laptop , so you can u okay . So here in fact after twelve um I don't know if it's I think it's twelve frames . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
942.5	Yeah , here we can see that , yeah . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
970.93	I can see uh there is another programme that can see 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
992.82	The other one I had problems converting uh uh the video into D_V_X_ , and then uh so I used the programme from uh software from Sebastien , P_ P_A_P_M_ to A_V_I_ . Because yeah , one thing uh maybe we will talk about that is the library uh , it's uh it doesn't uh compile anymore on Debian machines and , yeah , some maybe some work has to be done on this . I don't know why this uh image doesn't appear , this is the um um the frame that is uh uh extracted to be the shot key frame here . This one is this one , the middle one . So I don't know what why it doesn't appear , but it just uh a simple problem in the get frame . But what I can show you now is a little programme if we want to be um very precise about so it's ma get frames 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Sebastien]	[D_V_X, _, P, _, P_A_P_M, A_V_I, _, ma]
1139.61	Okay . Do you thi it's another kind of browsing page , but uh to be more precise about uh to to check maybe the this yeah , exactly , yeah , yeah . Anyway , you go back to one frame around f one sixty for instance , I don't know . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1548.85	Okay . Ah , okay , yeah yeah yeah . Because he did the movie , so he wants t okay , to archive , he wants to okay . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[t]
1624.44	Okay , I will play , yeah . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1770.67	Run the okay . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1786.61	I will have to check , but if it's five minutes videos , it's like done in yeah , quickly . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1855.59	Yeah . So that we'll use the whiteboard . So in fact , yeah , the interface is quite is quite simple to use . Um for instance you see um on the uh on the U_R_L_ I put okay , I I disco there is M_M_M_ dot IDIAP dot C_H_ slash V_C_G_I_ bin 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, IDIAP, _, _, bin]
1942.43	Uh okay , slash . And then 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1963.51	this name so I will say this is video name , so video name 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1980.86	Yeah , we can do the the get frame 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2008.13	And I could data dot X_M_L_ , but in fact it's just a simple convention , I w could have put nothing , but I just put data . The it's a convention . Data , and then video name . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L]
2022.42	Okay , it's R_M_ nine dot R_M_ for other stuff . But in fact , yeah , when I think now , we could have uh 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_M, R_M]
2033.01	Only with uh extension you can you can see . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2052.63	I did the same for kayak you say kayak in fact now it's kayak , and then you can see . And this output yeah , as your this output uh this file is an output from the mm the software , the shot boundary detection software . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm, shot]
2122.4	And every frame is stored into uh a b a backup in fact every frame um it's M_M_M_ who manage this automatically , so that um when uh you ask for this frame , in fact we can okay , I just view frame source 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2168.46	From the video with a time stamp it outputs a J_ PEG . This is quite uh nice . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[J, _, PEG]
2280.05	And it detects okay . Yeah . So you go inside the get frame function , you see where it i it saves it , and then there is a special naming convention , and you can remove the but i it's c yeah , it's true . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2301.68	Because there it's in cache , so that if I put another video with the same name , they th they will happen again . They will uh appear , this frames will appear . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2358.53	But it it can go in the browser cache also . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2366.64	Yeah , you can see here , yeah . Uh the first time is done o 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2462.35	In fact uh we we we could , you know okay , you know all these graphical user interface that you see uh okay . In fact okay . Mm yes . Yes , we could do that . We could put uh CINETIS slash here , and then a CINETIS slash is the sa yeah , it works . But the uh th the point is this interface is uh I think six or seven files only , X_M_L_ uh well it's per C_G_I_ , that output , X_M_L_ and X_S_L_ . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[CINETIS, CINETIS, X_M_L, _, X_M_L, X_S_L]
2560.43	Yeah , to do list or something . On a video annotation , on a video structure co correction . But i it's not easy on the web with H_ H_T_M_L_ pages to to do uh such corrections like uh video structure corrections for instance . For that you need it's possible maybe uh on interfaces like Flash or Java , uh but still uh i i i there is uh it takes bas more work and but i yeah yeah , I mean it's good good point . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[H, _, H_T_M_L, Flash, Java, bas]
2653.35	Well if yeah , it is there is no possible productions for these videos . Maybe what I say I'm very tired . But uh if po yeah , it's demo and uh one can say you have to guess the name to but uh yeah . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[po]
2695.24	Usually what we do sometimes uh okay , just to say something about password protections . Sometimes 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2720.93	a purely secure directory we p we we put a co code number like uh so that it's quite impossible to guess instead of video m uh name equals kayak then we would have uh zero six seven uh five or , you know , two . And then this directory from outside we have to take care that okay , not only the video name this U_R_L_ is not accessible , but also we should take care that in fact M_M_M_ it's in M_M_M_ data video browser and this is accessible from outside . We should take care that this directory or in fact this directory is not listable , you know , you cannot list from outside uh with uh F_T_P_ or H_T_T_P_ . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M_M_M, _, F_T_P, H_T_T_P]
2864.54	We can forget tosh yeah . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2965.59	Option for key frame extraction , okay . Uh sub-threshold , yeah . Leave it to one , yeah . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2973.8	Uh yeah . Maybe , I I will uh I will give you this file in uh as a rhy it's a kind of rhythmia , yeah . I just for preparing this uh nice discussion . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3071.48	Yeah . Mm there is a a the free one is okay . You can use the free we have a license here at IDIAP , but uh the if you want to pay , you pay for options such as uh resize or cropping , but in fact maybe we don't need that , and uh it's called Elix producer . 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm, IDIAP, Elix]
3250.98	Yeah , last thing uh this is a kind of uh X_M_L_ that is outputted , so so it's uh the structure is such as uh vi video segmentation with uh videos in begin and then for each shot you have an I_D_ well this is the terms from M_ PEG seven convention , but anyway . Shot begin and end . Uh a sh the shot key frame that is the middle here . Uh sub-shot 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L, _, M, _, PEG, Shot, sh]
3343.85	But we yeah , even we should uh for instance for the videos uh for the spectral clustering , for the clustering . Here uh I store the consecutive the distance between consecutive histograms , but we could uh store the matrix that's yeah . And then uh yeah . And I think i there are many possible things with uh spectral clustering , but but the uh with um there is one parameter that is very c wha I can't remember , what is the parameter uh 	IN1001.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
224.43	Find replace , yeah . 	EN2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
270.83	How much should you want um I had a few times where I thought well , it could be this , but if you're not entirely sure that it could be , 'cause it c it could be a combination of something else , like put the guess down or leave it as ambiguous in some way . 	EN2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
379.73	But if there's a chance that it's equally likely that they could have said something or they could have said something like ice cream and I scream , then just choose one and leave it , right . 	EN2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
437.01	And uh I'll ask you later on like if you still have your notes . 	EN2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
842.82	I try to take consistency , if they always stress the wrong part of the word , then I think okay , I'll let that in , but if if it comes out and like one word is 	EN2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
976.8	That'll give some transcriber a headache . 	EN2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1009.43	It's easy to , 'cause you're so used to t t tuning them out , and you know it's easy when I go back over I normally g like go back to the beginning , do a quick pass of the main sections again and think ah yeah . 	EN2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[t]
1149.55	Just one to the next door , yeah . Oh goodness , who would know what that was uh if somebody that didn't know about linguistics were trying to transcribe S_ node . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 	EN2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[S, _]
1325.0	Yeah . Would give Emacs a headache as well . 	EN2004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Emacs]

1115.36	Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation . 	IS1009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1580.88	I'll give it a three . 	IS1009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
969.12	But people are often enough looking at the help , once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . It's a psychology . Okay . And let us see what the market demands . We could just go to my presentation . 	IS1007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1045.52	And then we can decide what what we can yeah . 	IS1007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1113.32	if the remote control would look fancy . 	IS1007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1169.43	So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control . 	IS1007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1320.85	Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or so . 	IS1007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1521.24	I mean , better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_ and also with the speech recognition . And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case . 	IS1007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1790.57	No , we have a problem there . You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five . So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers 	IS1007c.D.words.xml	True	[twenty, four, thirty, five]	[]	[]
1999.32	A and in the same lines we would have a one more problem . If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company . So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something . 	IS1007c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
326.69	Well if we're gonna dump the part of it into a database anyway , we might as well dump all the fields we want into the database , calculate everything from there . Then we don't even have to worry that much about the underlying X_M_L_ representation . We can just query it . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L, _]
393.66	Well if we're gonna do that , we should try and store everything in in an X_M_L_ format as well . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L]
792.21	Well the nice thing about that is it will automatically be in sentences . Well more or less . So it will make more sense , and if you get just extract words . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
872.5	But it'll need to be calculated at word level though because otherwise there won't be enough occurrences of the terms to make any meaningful sense . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
917.14	Maybe we should have like um a cut-off . So it a w word only gets a value if it's above a certain threshold . So anything that has less than say nought point five importance gets assigned to zero . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
976.39	In memory , yeah . So just like unp there's bound to be like a media wave object or something like that . And just build one in memory . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1016.6	Well what I think I might try and build is basically a class that you just feed it a linked list of um different wave-forms , and it will just string them all together with maybe , I don't know , tenth of a second silence in between each one or something like that . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1041.16	Normalise it , yeah . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1072.83	Oh yeah , yeah , we'll need that . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1076.21	We also really wanna be able to search by who's speaking as well . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1278.34	That's easy . You just like create a new X_M_L_ document in memory . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L, _]
1422.98	And speaker . Speaker and um topic segmenting we'll need as well . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Speaker]
1448.4	Well yeah , and then it'll f preserve the order when it's displayed the 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1557.56	So we should basically make our own X_M_L_ document in memory 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L, _]
1567.3	module changes that , rather than the underlying data . And then have that X_M_L_ uh NITE X_M_L_ document tied to the interface . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L, NITE, X_M_L]
1579.86	Well , you can make it in a file if you want . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2051.06	Yeah , I mean we can process it in chunks if it gets too big basically . We can just process it all in chunks if it gets too big to load it into memory . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2104.99	And that will obviously make it much easier to display . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2144.53	Well , we can start off 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2155.09	And then just I can change that to work on whatever . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2505.0	So maybe we should try doing something really simple , like just displaying a whole meeting . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2890.34	Oh , mine's just gonna use the um hash map one in um Java . 'Cause I'm only gonna do it on small documents . It's just like bef until the information density is up and running . Just something to get give me something to work with . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Java]
2905.84	So it's only gonna use quite small documents , you see , to start with . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3115.47	Well all you really wanna do is look into getting some sub-set of the ICSI corpus off the DICE machines . 'Cause I hate working on DICE . It's awful . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ICSI, corpus, DICE, DICE]
3125.51	Like so I can use my home machine . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3178.12	'Cause I could just say at um going over S_C_P_ one night and just leave it going all night if I had to . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[S_C_P]	[_]
3214.76	I'll see if I can S_C_P_ it , I suppose . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[S_C_P]	[]
3229.32	Put it on to C_D_ . I can if I get down I can put to C_D_ . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[C_D, C_D]
3442.13	So quite small then . So you could just um you could use just the same thing we used to build the big dictionary . You just do that on-line 'cause that won't take long to build a little dictionary that big , will it . I mean just use the same tool that we use . Yeah . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3550.46	Which might need thinking about . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3617.34	And um what we consider a document's gonna depend on our context , I think . 'Cause if we're looking at the whole lot of meetings , we'll consider each meeting a document in sort of terms of this algorithm . And if we're viewing like say just a small topic segment you might look at even each utterance as a small document . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3746.73	Yeah , but you'd probably look at each meeting as a document . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3830.98	Yeah , sure . Yeah , you just like whatever you want to look at , you just jam together into an X_M_L_ file and that's your meeting , even though bits of it may come from all over the place or whatever . I mean I don't see why that's really a big problem . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L]
3949.19	Well like say you had um like say for a meeting , right , you've got like uh say a hierarchy that looks quite big , like this . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3966.04	Then when whatever your algorithm is doing , as long as when you're working with utterances , you go for all the leaves , like then if you need something next up , so like a topic segment , you'd go to here . But if you were looking at say this one , so only went like this . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3985.18	Right , so you it's same , you'd start with the leaves , and you go oh , I want a topic segment . So I go one layer up . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3992.16	See , and then if you're working with just a topic segment in there , it's the only thing you have to worry about . And like each time you want a higher level , you just need to go up the tree . And as long as your algorithm respects that , then we can just 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4008.28	process any arbitrary X_M_L_ 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L, _]
4019.3	A meeting , say , and that would be a topic segment . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4057.43	say . So then you'd start with all your utterances here , and when you go up to get topic segments , you go to here here here here here here here . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4114.85	So we'll see if we can get like a mini-browser just displays two things synched together of some kind . Yeah . Yeah . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4183.21	Maybe you should send a support form . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4186.71	Just say we want some web space . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4191.06	Listen to . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4553.72	We can just change the code . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4816.91	I could just use it with the frequency , I think , until the information density thing's finished . That would be really useful . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
5013.02	Tonight I'll try and um I'll either work some more on uh the T_F_I_D_F_ summarizer or do the audio thing . 	EN2001a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_F_I_D_F, _]
666.43	Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is . It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal , and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices . 	IS1009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
726.28	So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there . So uh you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions . 	IS1009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1008.93	And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's 	IS1009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1027.53	Yeah , and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so 	IS1009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1120.17	Um uh can you move onto the next slide . 	IS1009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1757.67	We can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know . yeah . 	IS1009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1775.78	Yeah of course that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know . 	IS1009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
398.52	Yeah , probably . Probably all these uh-huhs and uh-hmms are spelled differently in the thing or what's the problem . You should generalise . . 	EN2001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
835.77	So we should at least provide an overview of different meetings of one group . At the beginning he um talked quite a lot about that . 	EN2001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1652.28	Uh f I'm pretty sure that I can uh always find something to improve there . So I mean if you need me to work on something else , um I can try to finish my stuff um early , but um otherwise I can still keep working on it , improving it , I think . 	EN2001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2433.49	Yeah , but do we really want do display them separately because the user won't okay , for now for our s okay . 	EN2001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2448.14	Yeah , but then the user would have to know about what s w was what and what contributed to the blue stripes and what contributed to the red ones . Uh I think that wouldn't be a good idea . 	EN2001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
2613.31	Yeah , but we should all use the same programme , I think . Would prevent us from having too much mistakes in it . Or at least uh the mistakes would be consistent . 	EN2001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2664.95	Yeah , I mean I can do it . I can read in the different um importance measures and then re re-calculate the numbers . 	EN2001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
248.32	Maybe we should redesign it . 	IS1009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
276.23	Okay , I'll see what I can do . See if I r 	IS1009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
280.08	See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something . 	IS1009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
290.06	So that it will record okay . Um uh um traditional kitty cat . 	IS1009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
395.23	Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged . 	IS1009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
508.17	We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . 	IS1009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
538.53	Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it . 	IS1009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
572.64	Uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink . 	IS1009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
639.09	So the light sensor would activate the signal . 	IS1009a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
152.51	S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes . Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . You you can s here . And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[joystick, like]
352.68	Yeah just explain the button uh Norman . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Norman]
409.11	So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also . So basically th it's the same uh yeah . Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
448.07	And uh it's also cheaper to produce . We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
478.65	so Norman will explain to you . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Norman]
536.82	Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Norman]
593.56	that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
803.98	For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1198.63	Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[five, ,, six]	[]	[]
1276.63	six , let's go for six . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1303.72	Talk about 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1390.56	Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so I will give a six for the easy to use . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1524.13	And to improve the the look . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1532.8	Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1538.92	so let's go back to our laboratory and 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1790.71	Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1925.06	Come up with new product . 	IS1007d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
255.26	And that should kinda take care of itself as well . If she just sends one round around to everyone , then only the psycho-linguists will say what was for me . 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
430.52	Well do we have um a d an idea of how many people were gonna 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
494.36	and then give it a twenty minute break perhaps . 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
740.02	Yeah yeah yeah . But um people kinda like generally sort of sort them out themsel that sort that out themselves . Um I mean it's the thing about posters , unless you kind of say , you know , if your name is in the first half of the alphabet you can move and the other ones can't . 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	True	[the, first, half]	[]	[themsel]
762.54	I'd make it a whole morning or a whole afternoon . 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
984.53	Um well we should find out if um generally they use poster boards , if there are some poster boards that we can get ahold of , then that's 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1172.56	And do you think inf Informatics would 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[inf, Informatics]
1224.87	Would we wanna ask them and put some kind of like provisor in to make it um specific to sort of preemptively 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1234.39	um weed out the numbers or should we just say to them oh , you know , we're having this thing about language and , you know , if you got something you think about language , come to 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1340.58	Yeah . Yeah , let's just do that . That's seems most straight-forward . Yeah , just So so if you just send them a general thing saying the Linguistics Department's having this conference and would like to invite post-graduates from the Informatics . 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Linguistics, Department, Informatics]
1385.73	No one will understand . 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1939.62	Oh no no no , I was s I was saying ju just give them a bit longer to get back with the title . Say get back with the title by the seventh . Or do we need ten days to go from 	EN2003a.B.words.xml	True	[ten, days]	[]	[ju]
238.98	Yeah . So I I would need separate files for each segment or just maybe have delimiters inbetween each segment . 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
248.4	Okay , yeah , and y then I can make files of that . 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
395.39	Yeah , I would just end up with uh values for each word , so I wouldn't have um 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
407.13	I just I just would have the words , and then how we um how long each expression would be , I don't know . 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
456.06	So then we would have to fit in more than just one where values um 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
680.63	So we n would need a value label for each of those segments that are not dialogue acts . 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1344.07	Yeah , I I could use another a different approach , though . It 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1403.49	Um would you think it would make sense to just take um file files by speaker . It's it doesn't matter what input I give to um to Rainbow . So I just could g use the files as they are . I don't know if that's that would give an output . 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Rainbow]
1557.84	Um and you have several categories . And then it measures um which words are typical for a certain t category . And if you get a new document , it will um compare which words are in that new document . And if there are a lot of words that um are typical for one category , it will assign it to that category , and if it's typical for another one , it will assign it to that one . 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1623.36	No , I've just um split them up uh somehow um by um there are several documents for 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1890.33	All over the place . And in my case it would have I think it would have different uh values for each category . But in that category it would have the same value at each place . 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1927.72	Um that would be best , but I I would have to look if that . 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2182.67	Yeah , but it I think it should work for just one document , because it it compares between the categories , and if you just have one document um it still can find out which words are informative for that category and which are not . So if you have just one document in each category , and there are a lot of um occurrences of the word the in each one , so this word will be not very informative across the categories . So it should work for one , but I'm not sure if how exactly it it um calculates everything . Uh I think it's not possible to look that up . 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2345.39	Alright . Yeah , you you can use um 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2378.57	Yeah , maybe I should try something different and just programme it for myself . 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2849.37	We could even yeah , we could even have a look at our different measures , if they um 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2857.59	come up with the same same kinds of yeah . 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3228.6	Because you could take that on ours out maybe . If you take the laughter out and then calculate it . 	EN2001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
977.19	Can you reach , that would be great , thank you . 	ES2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1248.42	And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be . 	ES2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1257.3	Organic , really . And highly resourceful team mates might I add which is always a plus . 	ES2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1330.05	Do your own . Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . 	ES2009d.D.words.xml	True	[the, day]	[]	[]
1348.42	So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . Whatever . 	ES2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1412.6	That's kind of a good thing though , you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey . 	ES2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1448.46	I could only imagine . 	ES2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1743.76	My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe and they were just empty . 	ES2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1836.68	Well huh . An interesting day all in all I would say . 	ES2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1960.64	Make it sound eloquent . 	ES2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1989.59	Just add some prefixes , sounds classier . 	ES2009d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
297.33	Okay , I can start first . 	IS1009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
337.56	Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . 	IS1009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
351.32	Okay . Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine . 	IS1009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
395.8	Then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one . Next slide , please . 	IS1009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
410.4	Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . 	IS1009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
498.52	So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice 	IS1009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
510.39	which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , for example , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , uh th now the the uh yeah , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . 	IS1009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
555.73	Then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . So uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . So you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly . Even a kid can use that . So can you go on t t uh to the next slide . 	IS1009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[t]
1224.56	Transmit . 	IS1009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1547.66	Uh yes , I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser . 	IS1009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1591.21	No , it's it's , uh yeah , it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th For example , you have a T_V_ system , I'm the user and my family members are the user , I will already record uh a question like , uh good morning , like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television . So I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on . It will recognise my voice and will switch on . 	IS1009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[th, T_V]
1689.78	Supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button . 	IS1009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
86.03	Bless you . 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
370.9	For fashion , we go for fashion . The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
779.53	On the you can just take theirs and just 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1004.64	But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , and I never get it . Never ever . So 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1075.4	Just nice feel , but I hate spongy . 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1137.19	And it could the colour can fit your sitting room , so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have well I don't know . Um . 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1205.7	That you can p well I see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit and I'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put a um 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1333.99	If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1377.36	Mm-hmm . Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1480.32	No . But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it creates energy on its own . 	ES2011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[dynamo]
91.64	Check . Okay . I think it works . 	TS3004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
294.46	Ah I can see it now . 	TS3004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
391.54	Let me try one . 	TS3004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
416.42	I'll take this one . 	TS3004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
429.93	Yeah yeah , but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water . So I first uh draw the water . 	TS3004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
889.89	I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality . 	TS3004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1082.0	You can yeah , you can buy it with it . 	TS3004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1128.1	You can make it very special , to create our own um looks , but it's very hard to 	TS3004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1242.56	Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the 	TS3004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert]
171.3	Yeah , and yeah , most th th they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it , and um they use yeah , they use zap a lot , um uh fifty percent say they only 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[zap]
311.41	Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , so I can uh I dunno , so I can zap to my uh 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
322.67	f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what I uh so , the remote mu must see or um 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
333.21	must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , so I can zap t to 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
349.6	Recognise 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1483.89	And L_E_D_ uh on it . 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1863.96	here is my marketing report , maybe you ca you can look at uh that and 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1883.48	And uh wha what people want , 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2050.47	We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ and uh I dunno . Yeah . 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2057.57	How much it will cost and 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2070.99	It will come uh 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2178.76	Uh . But i if you if you are going to uh put the L_C_D_ on it , I think it's very important to use it , uh because it's use it uh 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2191.65	But nee the function of it . So you can use it maximum , because uh it's a lot it costs a lot . 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2226.24	you must use the maximum of it . 	TS3012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
894.66	the uh remote control . So we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this this is what I've seen . Uh the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_ . So uh 	ES2003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[dig, digital, signal, T_V]
995.08	You have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , uh will contact the T_V_ and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on . 	ES2003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[bulb]
1822.04	Yeah , think so . 	ES2003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1856.65	Nah , you'd see it anyway , if you hear it . 	ES2003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nah]
1975.74	So I should just look at um the speaker , the speaker and an L_E_D_ . And 	ES2003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
360.85	Use it . 	IS1003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
362.74	Make make yeah . 	IS1003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
488.79	Yeah yeah , you try . Try first . 	IS1003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
501.0	You can draw something which is very simple . 	IS1003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
507.99	Oh , maybe we should bring Kemy here . Kemy is really good at drawing . 	IS1003a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kemy, Kemy]
423.42	Okay , let's stand up and support you 	ES2015a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
553.25	Okay , I'll go next . I am a big animal lover . I like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . 	ES2015a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
632.96	I'll rub that out . 	ES2015a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
688.35	We can pretend . 	ES2015a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
966.64	tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . I dunno , some kind of alarm . You can press a button on your wall , signal , 'cause it always gets lost . 	ES2015a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[signal]
1052.32	I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . So , hmm . 	ES2015a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
76.68	So um if you want , I'll just give a brief overview of what's happening and then we can uh talk about , well , arranging these new uh the new office space . So um in case you haven't seen the the documents uh let me just uh show you very briefly the the configuration of the the space . 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
103.99	So um well , there is nothing much to say . Well you know how many of us are are present and you know that we are um a bit tight actually in our present location . Uh that's why actually the university finally um allocated us this uh this part of uh the Unimail building . So it's at the sixth floor . And it's uh sort of contiguous rooms as you you can all see from uh from here . Um so the the the one P_ , two P_ , three P_ means the the number of persons . As you can see we have several corridor um with a number of uh of uh of rooms , of one person rooms , two person room and and three person rooms . Um actually I think Agnes did this nice drawing so she even put the the view , so we have the old town on one side , and the mountains on the other two sides . Uh we have some bathrooms for us . Uh and a courtyard which actually means a sort of uh shaft , because uh the court is uh down at uh the first floor . 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Unimail, Agnes]
303.29	Um , I think quite a lot of people e expressed the need for that . So if we could do it , then I think it would be much nicer . Um let me also uh st say something Yep . 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[st, Yep]
352.42	Yeah , I think that's quite important to manage some space . Maybe we can think of , yeah , some two or three , yeah , for visiting people . Correct . 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
362.86	Mm-hmm . Okay , so let me finish with the the constraints which are almost done . So we also need to to find the a spot for the photocopier , the fax machine , and the printer . The fax , you know , is very small , but um the photocopier is quite huge , and the printer is uh well ab this size . Um okay , the offices comes with white boards . Not very uh very important . Uh the furniture that w each each person has and uh you have a list of people . 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ab]
582.05	Yeah . Yeah uh uh we Yeah . I I think that's Yeah , there is no real competition between the two , but we'll just try to find at least two solutions and see how how close they are , actually . It's it's I think well the m the people who who decided this thought it was the best solution to , mm well , you know , find two two kinds of opinions . Yeah . Well , we could have been eight h sitting around here and and talking , but I think it's it's more difficult . 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1063.28	Well , yeah , and some of the P_H_D_ students will hopefully finish their P_H_D_ at some point . 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[P_H_D, _, P_H_D]
1105.19	Yeah . Well , actually , so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room , but there are also more formal meeting rooms available in in the building , as we now know . 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1197.3	Yeah , it's already in progress . And you're you're working Uh I think , yeah , w Okay , so one of the things I have to do for the next time is fin find out about the separations between rooms and 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1506.6	Okay , we'll try , but all these , yeah , are say sort of difficult questions because they involve changing also the offices of the school and , you know , people just don't wanna change in general . Um , let's see , maybe we can find some temporary well , at least a proposal for Gisella . So , since the one-person rooms are quite , well , sort of um desired by a lot of people , she should probably No , y Yeah . Okay . 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gisella, y]
1609.38	Mm-hmm . Yeah , because in this case , yeah , Gisella could take one of the the two person rooms and the other place would be for some kind of visitor , that 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1643.82	Yeah . Okay . Okay so this sets a bit the stage for uh for Gisella then . Uh yeah we'll try to to find out . Um , actually , yeah , maybe we should remind that quite a lot of professors at the at the school actually share their office with their assistant . So b it looks like sort of an implicit tradition . Maybe not to be followed . 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1733.01	Yeah . No the point was to try to , well , just talk to them , to David , or 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[David]
1812.79	Okay , th then Okay then for the next time , um try to come up either with your own preferences , that's quite easy probably to state now that you know the constraints , or if you can poll a little bit the people around you , that would be I mean , even 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1830.12	Well , just discuss i Yeah , for instance , I mean No , no , I was thinking just ask people around you what they think about this . And I think , yeah , it will be nice to to come with maybe a sketch of of these . If you can do slides , it's even better , but uh don't be that formal . And uh we'll try to at least build up one coherent proposal , and we'll merge it with the other one when the other one uh is available . 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1870.18	And I'll try to 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1885.03	Yeah , w we can bring your coffee in the reading room , but 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1889.67	So so since maybe , you're a part-time here , and part-ti part-time at E_P_F_L_ , there are at least two um coffee machines in the building , one at the third floor , one at the first floor . And we can bring our coffee . No uh automatic uh coffee machines . So uh yeah . But , in 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[E_P_F_L, _]
1934.6	Come on , try try to be nice . 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1938.5	Gi give me a reasonable date . 	IB4003.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gi]
275.82	We should make a big sponge lemon , and then it'd be it would be yellow . It's Yeah . 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
934.11	and I'll I'll give you the uh , I guess , technical considerations for those . 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
953.33	Right . So , the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , and then we'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget . 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
986.0	Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , um and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , and ch 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_A, _]
1059.03	Um . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1099.15	Uh or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . Organic sponge . 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1211.51	Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
1294.71	See 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1296.55	So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1315.87	So it'd look like this kinda . 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1325.62	Yeah , and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1372.23	Okay , we could do that . Um . 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1412.95	Okay uh I could put the microphone here . 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1535.63	They can work from a You don't have to hold it . 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1543.42	I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , you know they have uh fruits all round them . Now just make sure they don't eat the remote . 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1842.11	Right , it's like those watches that you c So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna, grab]
2034.74	Try uh flipping the screen down . 	ES2005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
11.68	Je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . It really looks like a banana . 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Je]
61.09	So we will uh I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
70.52	uh I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work . And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . Then we will uh evaluate the product . 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
102.74	And uh end 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
116.44	So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy , 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
159.89	So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if , and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert . 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
349.64	Well , we can choose what we want . Okay , let's say that seven is the best . 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
453.3	Four , yeah , let's put four . 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
465.44	Yeah , I think so . Yeah . I would give a I would give a seven as well . It's very easy to use . 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
485.94	Oh yeah , its its f its fruit fruit shape . I would say seven . And is very very nice design . 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
547.19	Yeah . But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material . So maybe we can put a six . 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
641.88	So , I think , we can summarise . So we have seen the prototype . It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . The the the financial aspect were okay . We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . 	IS1001d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
139.59	Format save . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
414.27	Our current customers are in the age group forty plus . And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
539.72	find yours . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
564.85	Yeah . Uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
668.7	Yeah so maybe you can hide them or something . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
779.71	Uh kick off . Oh working design I got it . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
911.69	Work harder . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
951.86	And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , uh the target group . We have to make be clear what that is . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
975.06	Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1150.95	Do the also with the thumb . So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1431.45	Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1436.15	So maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1557.4	Contrast yeah . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1597.45	Yeah you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle . And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1669.2	Uh name a channel , or 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1693.0	Yeah but can you also say I want f uh Veronica on the channel number uh five or 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Veronica]
1840.86	The User Interface Designer can design a menu 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer]
1854.72	Yeah . Yeah I can . I'll just try to reorganise uh things . Um 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2029.83	Put it on top . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2098.13	You can navigate . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2101.74	But you can also navigate the channels . And the volume . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2180.17	Yeah okay go ahead . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2331.5	Make me proud . 	TS3006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
38.69	We'll open that when the time is right . 	ES2013d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
59.52	Let's see what this thing does . 	ES2013d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
112.09	Right . Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . So we're going to make a very fast track . Okay . 	ES2013d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sarah, Excel]
218.54	Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . Um we decided chip on print would be used . Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling 	ES2013d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm, kinetic]
660.45	And then you can use your thumb . 	ES2013d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
670.09	I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the 	ES2013d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
788.13	Try again . 	ES2013d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
944.33	Come on . 	ES2013d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1429.49	Oh shoot , forget that . Kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one . 	ES2013d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kinetic]
1442.51	Okay . Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . 	ES2013d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1598.99	'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . 	ES2013d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1617.0	let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement . 	ES2013d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
235.99	We can put it . Mm-hmm . 	IB4001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
598.2	You can u mm-hmm . 	IB4001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
950.74	Do so Yeah . 	IB4001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1417.6	Yeah , yeah . But we can uh reserve So if you reserve a two people room , we can put uh trainees 	IB4001.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
0.08	Uh , making a profit of fifty million Euros . So , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
143.92	Sorry , carry on . 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
162.73	For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty . 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
170.44	Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[k]
180.51	uh , oh actually , no , we'll allocate . So you do the looking around at other remote controls . Um , if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into um 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
201.86	basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one , how what sort of materials are available to you whatever . And obviously , other instructions will come from the personal coach . 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
215.63	Which will probably just usurp what I said so 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
219.33	Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive . 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
279.54	Okay , groovy . And no doubt we'll get um 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
285.14	Sorry . We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well . Okay . I shall I can't imagine these are worth much . Okay . 	ES2005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
63.89	Come on . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
175.42	No , just tell us . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
343.98	Well , I'll I'll get back on it . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
505.21	Yeah , I'll get back on that . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
533.57	I'll check what they exact mean . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
627.78	I'll I'll give you my design . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
650.29	to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
674.34	Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
727.23	So and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten . And I think 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
781.49	I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
888.52	So we can uh switch these to I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[the, bottom, half]	[]	[]
912.05	Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M_P]
935.52	To use 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1127.14	Well one of the options . You can Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it . So you can just replace them I think . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1137.24	That was the idea , or just uh release one . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1142.77	Yeah , uh Or just uh sell different ones . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1250.75	Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh Yeah . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1293.25	I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone . And I can change the colour of it . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mi]
1647.94	Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1746.37	Use the dz 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1833.3	Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1904.95	Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2087.96	Yeah okay . But uh I had a lot of pictures Oh I can show you here 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2132.2	I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look . So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
2145.13	And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new . No rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M_P, M, _, M, _]
2260.87	Think the scroll wheel won't be very big . Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . So it will just be a small 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2289.65	Yeah okay . Well , maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2386.0	Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . 	TS3004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[u]
0.04	That should hopefully do the trick , um . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
34.24	Okay . So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
77.66	Okay . So um due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first , and uh show us the prototype . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
180.46	I'm afraid yeah . We'll go into that a bit more , but please go on . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
524.09	um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright . Yeah , is that 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
616.92	Okay . Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well . Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ , at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , require more buttons , etcetera . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros, L_C_D]
652.08	Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in , we've got point two of a Euro left over there . So we're just managing it really . Even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate . With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
702.23	That should still be viable . We've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ . So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility . Um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here . We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be . Um . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
725.19	We can I can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um . I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
797.65	I've said single curved . We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which I've had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit . Problem comes here as you can see in the interface . Um 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
816.92	if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button . That might make sense , because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what , four point five Euros , which is an awful lot , so that could well be wrong . Even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side . As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro, L_C]
919.73	That'll it literally would just be a button . We might have to 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1001.46	If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C]
1027.2	It's a shame . We should possibly have 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1050.59	Again , you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one . Um but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1062.9	I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us , despite the cost it's gonna incur . Um 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C]
1095.29	It's hard to tell . Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved , and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1264.42	Maybe even slight well oh yeah , pretty much point two Euros , I'd say . So we'll leave that one for now . we'll just have 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
1353.81	Just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , I'm not sure how much time . We've not hit the five minute mark warning yet , but . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1398.94	Yeah . I'd say we're doing well there . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1723.16	Y oh and you've knocked batteries out . Um right okay it's considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
1834.64	Hide it in the fruit basket . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1940.05	Does anybody want to um 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1964.39	I would say 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1996.08	It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes . So maybe this is literally just a way around it . Um I dunno . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2064.1	If you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector , then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is . Because they will pay outrageous cash to 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2152.21	Probably would have mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end , I would have to agree . It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive . Always hard to tell until you know the costs . Um . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2231.7	And then the final one where you get to call it Hal . But we'll go into that later . Right um is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , um 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Hal]
2289.79	So um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such . 	ES2003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
763.03	Yeah , press them . 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
800.94	Uh well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sarah]
830.49	uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss . 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
869.73	uh standard universal remote control . It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . It also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sky]
894.23	Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
967.25	Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
982.48	But we could go back to the pictures of the 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
993.27	and possibly discuss what we think about them , but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first . 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kate]
1542.41	No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer and 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[chunky, A_A, _]
1875.94	do them on the actual television itself , like here you have a 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1890.48	um I would say that they are definitely less relevant . 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2114.29	From their I'll just use it from their website . 	ES2013b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
199.44	Yeah . Otherwise , could you just describe 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
964.1	Finish tonight . But basically yeah maybe I can continue with my presentation , it would be al you you but I think we have some technical problem or so . So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control . If fact 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[al]
984.06	Do I have oh yeah . Now I have enough cables . 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1005.06	Like that . I'm just going to describe . Basically we have a a battery a power supply here . After that we just have um user interface . Let's say that 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1019.3	something like that , which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that . 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1033.17	Push button or a L_C_D_ . After that we we feed that into um 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1148.6	I would say . I would say uh about eight months to have the first results . 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	True	[about, eight, months]	[]	[]
1326.81	To to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that . 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1694.71	I know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now , you have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back . 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1742.8	Let's say that we can do something like that . This is uh incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five . 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1754.33	To go fa to go faster . 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1841.41	Or we can do something like that . We can design the remote control to have access . You know some remote control have uh protection and so you you y 	IS1001b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
158.97	Basically in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see right over here . We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad . If you put them all black , it's not really that good a contrast . So 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
211.79	We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute . So that's basically what we chose there . If you have anything to add , please interrupt me . 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[teletext]
294.68	I'd say that too . 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
420.94	We could take out a curve indeed . 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
507.56	Which we can fabricate , okay . 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
675.24	So we could u still have the comfort . 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
700.25	No , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control . So that's not really that 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
729.32	Yeah . I would say I would agree with you on the colour , because that's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money . So we can always do that . 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
783.51	Yes , we could have 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
935.57	To make it that way , yeah . 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1158.76	Or we could say it 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1164.26	Or we could say neutral , we 'cause we scratched the 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1215.04	Maybe we should go with a two then , because it's not perfect , because we can't do it initially , but we 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1492.84	And we could share information which we received . 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1524.97	Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , because 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1539.95	further elaborate on that . So 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1629.73	Yeah , well it could also possibly be well , is it a more real-time information base , so we can all see which information is available to one another . 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1863.68	You should write it down as a an option . 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1906.02	Should I write the banana down or 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1925.51	Uh do you mean it like 	TS3012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
167.12	So the idea is uh okay , w we have in the lab a notion about um root mirroring . The idea is if we can provide a feedback to people working together , uh it may help them self-regulating their activity , their collaboration . So could be normative or not . In our own case we want to have uh a table that would be accessible by by students . Uh at O_P_F_L_ we are uh 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
200.83	At O_P_F_L_ uh the learning centre will be built in a couple of uh years . So the idea we we will have plenty of rooms uh like in libraries or meeting rooms where student will arrive and work . So if we have this table uh that is accesi accessible to students if they arrive , if we provide a feedback of um who is talking , um instantly the uh at one moment or uh through time or the turn taking , uh maybe they will just by seeing an explicit uh feedback of that , they will um take profit uh of it and um 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
405.81	Okay . And the so this L_E_D_ modules are being uh designed uh now . We should have them in a couple of weeks . And uh we will be able to uh start uh evaluating uh the prototypes . Uh uh about the C_S_C_W_ class , that will start at the end at the beginning of November . Uh so the student will be asked to design uh a table . So to find the shape uh of the table to get uh who the and put that uh on the um on table uh legs . And we will uh so at the beginning we wanted to put this L_E_D_ modules uh in the tables . 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[a, couple, of, weeks, the, beginning, of, November]	[]	[]
503.5	And we have yeah . And we have the feeling that to have the information embedded in the table , make it part of the table , it I don't know , we'll we we will try uh we don't really know what uh will happen with this prototype . We are very excited about that . Okay , uh maybe before uh going on on this subject we can talk talk a little bit on uh 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
765.32	So the last layer is about this visualisation . W we will uh we are thinking about the visual grammar , meaning that when we have an interaction event that is uh fired , we uh will associate uh a way of visuali visualising it . So for instance if someone is talking , uh we can just have a light that will centre on the point that is uh close to him . That could be an uh instant uh feedback . And if he has been talking maybe seventy percent of the last five minutes , as me , uh uh it it may be reflected as the um intensity or size of a s a cycle . 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
811.69	Centre on the same point . And then if there's turn taking , we can show waves of light going from uh me to you uh or from other people . Or using the centre part of the table to show some something more about the um uh more general uh dynamic . 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
861.82	In uh we can change inte so we have uh eight by eight uh two times LEDs . Each uh LED is actually three LEDs um . Th uh M_G_B_ LED . And we can change the intensity . So it's already quite a rich uh feedback . 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
971.33	Maybe we could summarise the question we were thinking about . 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1111.68	Okay . Go on . 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1126.5	And I would add uh one more . It's about um because what we can uh record is uh sound uh origins . So in po uh so no sonic points . But what we are interested in is people . So the question is if someone is moving , I'm talking here , I stop talking , I'm going here , I'm talking . How to detect that it's the same people . If we want to uh integrate information to say these people has uh spoken seventy percent of the time in the five last minutes . Obviously we need to uh to know that it's the same people . So right now our practical solution is to have one uh microphone close to um every place where people are supposed to sit . So we can infer that if a sound is coming in this area , it's the same . So kind of trick . But for the beginning it's enough . 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[po]
1292.66	So in a couple of days we will get this um uh the fire-wire uh box . So we will we have chosen one that has eight uh line up . So we'll be able to have line in , sorry . So we will be able to plug uh up to eight uh microphones with uh jack plugs to exhale air with the possibility of extending with eight more X_L_R_ uh microphone with another box . 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[a, couple, of, days]	[]	[X_L_R]
1356.49	To have eight more X_L_R_ if we need it . But we are not sure to to buy it now . But we can extend it . 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_L_R, _]
1695.85	So maybe w uh you could present a different work uh you have done . And uh I don't know how they are . 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2514.41	And can you detect if someone is laughing or angry d uh there is kind of signature uh even if we can't really trust it uh uh s one hundred percent of the time . Uh 	IN1008.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
387.48	Mm this is very representational fish . Um I like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups , so . 	ES2013a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
528.37	B yeah . Um I would think would be more like sixty percent . 	ES2013a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
531.82	But um let me I have two thoughts . One hundred , fifty percent . 	ES2013a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
663.13	We could make a Hello Kitty 	ES2013a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kitty]
670.68	Yeah . We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation . Well I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great products . Electrical their industrial design is very good . 	ES2013a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[Japan]	[Japanese]
706.45	Well , that's a really good point , because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , you know , so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down . 	ES2013a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
731.14	Mm . We can make it smart like an iPod , you know , make everything menus . 	ES2013a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
478.79	Need an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ . Is that did I 	ES2003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1109.36	So uh to gather my research , two basic methods . We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe , what's what's the new black , you know , as it goes . Next slide please . 	ES2003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Europe]
1130.02	Uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . As in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , but they don't care so much , you know . They want it to be that's sounds a bit like a contradiction . 	ES2003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1178.22	I is it has to be cooler than easy to use , you know , if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features . And if it's easy to use that's a bonus . The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . 	ES2003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1258.59	Um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it . Um I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , so maybe it is important for it's the up to the interface guy . So if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . It could be something like , 	ES2003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1335.68	And if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it's long lasting , you know it's damage resistant and stuff like that , so . So just to summarise , people want stuff that's cool , that's that looks like it's cool , and if it is cool then that's a bonus doesn't have to be um people like fruit and veg . We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it . People like spongy material . If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea . And also , this was this year . 	ES2003c.C.words.xml	True	[this, year]	[]	[]
1453.17	That's a good point . You can incorporate names into the menu . 	ES2003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1641.22	works with your particular television . But why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature , I I don't know . 	ES2003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2134.17	It would make sense if you could 	ES2003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
16.64	No , just uh ask if if he could manage . 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
194.15	Let's see where my 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
276.92	Think 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
325.51	Exactly . Alright . Right . Yep . Next one is curving . Uh we can make a model that has one curve , two or three . 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
555.29	Think . 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
563.95	I think they are looking for that . Of course we have uh a young target group . So they might find that attractive in a remote con 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1365.93	Yep . So I can uh qui oh . I can quickly make a conclusion 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1667.67	I would prefer round . But doesn't matter , doesn't matter . 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1871.6	I would curve the whole actually . 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1875.14	I would curve the whole . Like um like it hangs over your hand a little bit . 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1883.7	Then it will bounce and you don't drop it so easily . 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1915.06	Let's make it yellow then . Uh 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1939.16	Maybe once we can make a special edition in according with Chiquita . 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Chiquita]
1955.08	Mm-hmm . They might wanna be the first ones to uh 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1962.38	Oh , perhaps they can use it . 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1964.84	Or give a special edition uh with with 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2119.65	So beep . 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2199.18	I would change . I would take a yellow remote control . To have it flashy , to have it it's for young people . 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2234.12	It's either black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa . And I would say take a yellow cover and black buttons . 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2282.66	No , forget it . 	TS3012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
778.78	Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . So you might as well remember the number . 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
826.65	Yeah okay . But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel . 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1221.6	to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1311.39	Yeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working . 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1315.01	And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the Otherwise it won't work . 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, Otherwise]
1446.57	What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so And then he saves that setting and then um it's working . 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1548.47	Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah . Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can Basically if the battery is low , it won't work . So you have to indicate that it's 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1607.3	Yeah , but mm like when you push it n n Yeah . You have your finger over the button . So you can see Yeah . Or or m maybe on top of the A green light is flashing or 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1657.8	Yeah . We'll have enough power to 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1772.33	No , and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use . 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[teletext]
1913.63	Yeah . But it has to work . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[English, Dutch]
1942.62	And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing or 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1972.48	Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh 	TS3004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
159.62	You could change the vegetable , or fruit . 	ES2011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
194.61	It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow . And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually , would be the um thing the locator . How how so 	ES2011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
243.24	You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . 	ES2011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1159.02	Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection , like you could probably do a strawberry still . I think the broccoli would be out . 	ES2011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1167.51	You could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like sorta like a joystick . 	ES2011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1212.92	Yeah . That could work . 	ES2011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1283.66	Yeah . Yeah . Like uh we could do I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped . 	ES2011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sha]
1397.71	So we'll have to like 	ES2011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1407.81	You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like , but you could do like 	ES2011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1694.7	Yeah I kinda thought that um I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated because I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time . But um 	ES2011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1755.51	I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the 	ES2011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
237.47	Well , we we tried uh many knobs to tune on th on that . Because you can decide what compression factor and everything . So I tried a little bit like um pick maybe three knobs and try to go through the three D_ three D_ cage to see what happens in which which kind of settings . So this we did . But we we didn't because there was still a question that I don't remember right now . Because there was some essential question 	IN1007.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1512.89	Well yeah . Yeah , yeah . Go on . 	IN1007.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1804.57	Yeah . But there is a the back-end recognizer which I will give you which is turn-around of eighteen minutes or well from eleven to fifteen minutes . Normally it would take hour and a half . 	IN1007.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1903.83	No . But after you find out the back then it will be that will be the yeah . So we will send you the papers related . And I will point you to all the code which I have . And yes . Yeah , yeah , yeah . 	IN1007.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1928.52	Yeah , I can play it back . So I can just now tell the the locations of all the files and you can rewind . Yeah , yeah , ferret . 	IN1007.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2100.35	Yeah . Uh uh I would add 	IN1007.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2191.85	Well I would like to , yeah . I should . 	IN1007.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2215.31	Two two years , yeah . And I would have to stay one more . Uh well it would be good reason for Petra that I have to stay here . . 	IN1007.D.words.xml	True	[Two, two, years]	[]	[Petra]
2363.35	Uh ask Hynek . Ask my boss . 	IN1007.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Hynek]
148.95	Okay , just hang on a second everybody . I haven't actually looked at this yet . 	ES2007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
213.67	Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . 	ES2007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
240.72	Or put 'em in your pocket , yeah . 	ES2007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
405.03	Um yeah , I think you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks . 	ES2007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
571.68	Mm . Let's move on to the next page . Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros . 	ES2007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm, Euros, Euros]
754.47	but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . 	ES2007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
773.8	Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . 	ES2007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
956.3	See 'cause , I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make . 	ES2007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1009.71	Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should 	ES2007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1032.68	Yeah , that's right . Yeah . I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but that's not gonna happen . 	ES2007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1100.59	Let's move on . 	ES2007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1103.03	Oops , let's close that . Next meeting , uh okay . 	ES2007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1176.23	You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that . 	ES2007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
341.67	Oh it should okay , yeah . The user should know . 	IS1003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
799.08	We've made a study , so could you go to next slide . Sorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , 	IS1003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
821.01	and see what was okay or not for them . Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . 	IS1003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
846.68	Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um 	IS1003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
899.07	And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 	IS1003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
960.0	Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay . And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay . 	IS1003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1029.58	Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the 	IS1003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1160.7	Yeah , remember it's twelve Euros . 	IS1003b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
398.53	Okay . This sounds like a really great idea . One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive . 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
440.2	Alright . We'll still have to investigate the financial implications . 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
448.71	Alright . I like the environmental approach . Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well . 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
478.71	So those are what , um , we'll c construct the remote . Those are all the 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
986.46	Alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , because I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button . 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1251.92	I agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . Um , financially and and functionally . Um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . Um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned . 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1284.21	Yeah . And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself . Wonder if it would have 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1322.66	Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure . 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1507.18	Okay . Before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . Um , for one thing , because Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . Um , for many reasons . So um we have that decision sort of made for us . Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . Yep . 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[V_C_R]
1626.24	more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , um , all the remote controls must have our um We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . So , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . Um , it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company but , another thing is that , um 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1654.42	we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable . 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1693.85	and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . Um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . So , um , we already know that it'll just be for the television . It'll It won't have teletext . But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve . 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Genevieve]
1837.35	Yeah , it would have t 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1863.68	Probably , I mean . That's your department you'll have to sort that out . 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1967.51	Could we somehow We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . 'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours . 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2233.35	throw some plastic in it , you know . 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2244.07	Yeah . Well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues . So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out . 	ES2015b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
175.38	I only v have three slides , so . I just look at the mm 	IS1001c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
217.02	And um yeah we can change directly . In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . 	IS1001c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
285.08	We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . But 	IS1001c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
358.08	wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , and if we could reduce that . 	IS1001c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
57.2	Just just carry on . 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
705.52	Yeah , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , yeah . 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
952.15	We can have a hand sorry a wind-up , yeah , which I think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control , but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device , which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . You have to it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work , but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , it'll work . Or we we had talked about solar power , but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark . 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[kinetic]
1017.29	I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that . 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1054.28	select something . Um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it's it the technology is there . And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . All the other fancy interface designs go out the window , I'm afraid . Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display . 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
1247.14	We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , which would allow um say a banana , but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , we can't do anything fancier . 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1332.58	I think it yeah , you you will do an 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1560.77	Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea . 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1754.21	But we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper . 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1825.33	Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2050.21	And and how much you do have to keep it moving , 'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity . 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2185.99	Yeah . I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but I agree , it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is . 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2201.38	I should I should r 	ES2013c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
74.69	Move to the meeting room . Okay . 	TS3006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
320.92	Okay I'll will give it an uh an eye . 	TS3006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
325.02	Hey . Come on . 	TS3006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1086.42	I would first m 	TS3006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1188.57	Can we leave now or 	TS3006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
117.75	Yeah . Uh , me again , Rajan the Marketing Expert . Uh , as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out , sorry , yeah sure . 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Rajan, Marketing, Expert]
189.39	And what we got was , we found that if you uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . They are not so good looking . So , we have to put stress on this , uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
219.52	And yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wi]
228.16	Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . So even if the available market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . Then 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
271.92	And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
290.87	Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . So we have to take care of this fact also . 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
330.39	Uh , escape , okay thank you . Then if we look at this slide , uh these are in your shared documents , you can see , like 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
348.84	Ah t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . Yeah , these are different age group persons like uh sorry , I can open it in another way . 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[consu]
369.74	Uh , yes . If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[thirty, five, years]	[]	[]
391.48	So we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh T_V_ are belong to this age group . So we should look 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ag, T_V]
411.92	Yeah . We can look at that that factor also , so yes . 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
561.04	Escape . 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1544.34	But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark . Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales , so we should take it into consideration also . 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2012.07	Glow in dark . 	ES2005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
107.99	So what do you think for uh 	IB4002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
172.62	I would say not together in a three it's quite a lo yeah , yeah . 	IB4002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
497.67	Yeah , I'd like to have a view to the mountains , but well 	IB4002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
774.02	Yeah , I mean with whom you'd you'd to with whom you'd like to work in the same office . I mean , is it important to have someone uh from the same project or um 	IB4002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
792.58	Yeah , we can skive . But you're gonna disturb all the people . 	IB4002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1009.44	traffic there I would say . 	IB4002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1098.48	Well , you can you als already speak quite well Finnish , so we might get along , yeah . Yes , I will . 	IB4002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1121.8	find the people . 	IB4002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1441.35	We can skive as you said . 	IB4002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1647.8	Yeah , I think it's okay . Let's see what the the other ones say . 	IB4002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1725.05	Of course , you can mail em yeah , if you have something . 	IB4002.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
157.73	So you can show your prototype if you want to . 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
270.32	So you can put it on the back as well if you want to . 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
288.78	Yeah , you can put it separate . 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
442.25	Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well . 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
466.42	Yeah , as well . Just make make a Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
674.12	Just make it 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1028.91	No , no . Make them No , just make them black or grey or something . 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1065.32	Okay , just give it a two . 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1259.88	Okay , just Easy to use is very cool , so just give it a two . 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1336.5	Yeah , just draw it afterwards . 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1554.04	Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . If I forgot anything , just say it to me . 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1611.04	It's hard to say . But maybe we have to um Yeah , okay . Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . We get different ones , that's all . 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1623.3	So you can put a recharger in it as well . But this is expensive , the sample speaker . 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1654.93	So I just want you Yeah , we just made it . So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[evalu]
1881.26	It's the same for the presenta for the presentations . You can do it from here . That's much easier than standing there . And so you've 	TS3004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
172.06	Do we Do we change the 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
204.75	Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
299.29	Think I can Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
308.46	get a number in here . 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
334.6	And in the end , we will c uh count an average 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
493.67	I um Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two . 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
655.77	But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two . 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
729.38	Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two . 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
770.56	I would say yes . So um 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
774.41	Well , let's also give this a two . T 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
879.39	Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating . So , we will do that . Yes . 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
916.59	Come on . 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1117.86	We would have uh n 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1135.6	If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[joystick]
1694.94	Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient . 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1742.52	To tell their opinion . 	TS3010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
178.1	Well once you get this information , your frequency and uh your vocal contract or how it's called , uh y you can use this information to compare to to to the frames here . 	IN1009.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
206.18	No no no no . That that that everything is done through through the voice here , you take a voice of someone , and then you can get out this information , it's it's not p it's clear it's not perfect , but s it's enough to to to use it for for different purposes and uh 	IN1009.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
518.87	Sound . 	IN1009.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
617.28	You might might want to do . 	IN1009.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
767.65	No , but I think once you have the voice for a person , you can start to do this and uh once uh people have speech recognition or uh far enough to t 	IN1009.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1090.58	Does it work if I put in my email and uh 	IN1009.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
674.83	Yeah we could just go with um 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
845.12	Um it's probably just I dunno if it's worth getting into , but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
923.41	Do you want me to d um 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
942.91	Um , alright so the way this works , I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint , I'll try and do it as quick as possible . Um , this is um I'll just go over your head if that's okay . 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
961.8	Oh course , yeah that's true . Let me get that . 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
979.64	The idea is that I've set up I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , and uh so we can review that . Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1021.99	So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , okay . So these i these i th are the and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1078.11	Okay let's go with five then . 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1096.14	Let's go with two point five then . Okay , um control high tech innovation . 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1142.07	Okay so we'll go two . 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1187.9	It would cost more than plastic . 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1279.48	Yeah that's that's me . I did have one other um one other frame I thought , I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information , I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals . It's not something I need to p push through , but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1304.47	Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant , I dunno the Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon . It's just discussion . I mean obviously we can just abandon this , it's fine . I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do . 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Whatever]
1440.43	To use . 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1457.97	Or sort of our work on setting this up . Yeah . Well , is it uh okay I'll just go through your system then . The the room uh 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1529.11	Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours . 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1553.05	So what do we do . We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[twelve, and, a]	[]	[]
1677.84	Um yeah I think I think it's I think it's good . I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1781.9	Fully agree . 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1924.59	Um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1971.22	Think could be , yeah . 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1992.07	Yeah , because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush , for example , or whatever , I would've actually used it , um 'ca you know , just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time . 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint, Paintbrush]
2383.59	Do we retreat to our , to continue our 	ES2002d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
471.42	Um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
511.3	Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
518.22	and we can put the price up . 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
570.29	manually change channels or volume . 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
576.25	yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
623.64	Maybe like it'll beep or something . 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
704.42	And uh it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
899.36	Or even I mean you could even just have it left on . You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
997.96	Stand out . 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1048.5	'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just you address the remote , you address the computer , and then give it a command . 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1107.15	Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1156.89	We c yeah , we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1166.11	So uh yeah , if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1176.67	Yeah and probably it would look better as well . 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1250.63	Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1878.12	It could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . 	ES2012b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
83.26	Stay . 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
207.64	Yeah , but most m most browsers , when when you uh put an X_M_L_ file up in it , it'll just apply some default style sheet to it anyway that shows you 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L]
459.08	'Cause you know , like a wee bus journey over to Maplin might solve the problem if it's getting in the way . 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Maplin]
525.05	So you can find out whether they have it . But you'd have to phone over to find out if they have it in stock down there . I actually live not that far from there . Um so 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
572.35	Yeah , then , you know , put your mind at rest . 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
857.97	And I'll just check . 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
950.24	Ach , try phone . 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ach]
970.2	Yeah , or re change the schedule . 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1120.53	Yep . Well that's that's one to raise at the meeting . Um I v might talk to Ellen about that ahead of time 'cause uh they may have she and Martin may have had discussions about appropriate use of the lab . 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ellen, Martin]
1384.13	You can um call a JAST telcon between you and Marloes . You know , i if it's not that see , you know , with the cold calling you can usually at least find out whether they're alive and get an an offer to to get something . But , you know , the next the next escalation is saying no we really need to talk about this . We're gonna talk about it , you know , Tuesday , at such such a time unless you 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[Tuesday]	[]	[JAST, Marloes]
1424.05	I'd just hate for that to c um to slow you up in collecting stuff , that's all . 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1558.39	Yeah . So so we'll worry about it then . 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1602.08	Yeah yeah yeah . Or Do y 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1742.04	Okay . So uh I'll uh remind myself to look at what's next before the next time we get together . 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1814.08	Let's see , that's like the 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1844.47	Oh yeah , you have to promise to tell us how that is . 'Cause people do ask me . 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1874.37	Well , if they were gonna do that then they'd force you to go to it . I would and I would know somebody who'd gone to know . You know . I'm pretty sure they didn't have induction in my day . So 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2406.21	Wait . 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2815.93	Yeah . Uh yeah , I can imagine I can imagine that also requiring some discussion about whether what they do is what we actually wanna do . That should be interesting . Uh 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2939.27	Oh yeah , well that'll take forever . 	EN2009c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
556.98	You can connect this one . 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
591.54	Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
822.65	I can move as far as 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
849.08	And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control . Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important . 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
873.46	So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed . And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , alright . 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
901.71	So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna and um 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert, Anna]
938.87	w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design . So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want . Uh we want an on off button , it can be uh it's simple but it's it's important , and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , right . 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1138.04	Yeah . We will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared and uh 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1187.51	That can control o other things . 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1197.01	Of course yeah we should take that into account in the uh 	IS1000b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
334.754	No . Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . But 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
634.804	Well , b basically it when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . So 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
667.2439999999999	That's maybe that's better . Maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple , but that's not what uh has been asked . 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
677.5039999999999	So we should kick the board's uh Well 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
769.684	Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . So 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
832.154	It has flavour . Yes , that's right . You should taste it . 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
849.084	It has to do with fashion , I guess . So do 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
916.194	Well , let's let's this product . 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
968.0039999999999	Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1159.994	Maybe Uh I I think I think something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . So , I th 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1263.434	No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1289.344	Basically it's it's completely programmable . You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1367.5339999999999	But that that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple . You can use your voice to to programme it . It's 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1399.464	Yeah , I'll give it a one . 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1514.764	Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions . And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does . So I think it's worth its price . 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1904.734	And and uh w you were when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing . And a lot of these buttons don't appear here . So it's 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Windows]
1945.624	Pop uh pop up the champagne . 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2118.924	Let's wrap it up . 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2133.114	Thank you Mister manager . Now , let's have uh a bottle of champagne . 	TS3011d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
814.38	About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option . 	TS3003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
836.87	Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . 	TS3003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
863.41	Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . 	TS3003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
977.98	Yes w there there are four options . We could use the basic normal battery . Uh a hand dynamo . But I don't think that's really an option . You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . Uh solar cells . But not every room is very light so it's not a very good option . Or the kinetic energy . 	TS3003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1185.32	But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . 	TS3003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1389.25	Mm I dunno . I'll have to uh research . 	TS3003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1533.41	Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . 	TS3003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1550.07	Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality . 	TS3003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1564.12	Pick one you like , yes . 	TS3003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1871.76	So I could draw them out . 	TS3003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1880.24	Let's look at the flat case . 	TS3003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2088.03	Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page . 	TS3003c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
356.51	Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , I'm little , you can get to the top , with standing on a chair . 	ES2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
443.16	Um , I'm very impressed with your artistic skills , mine's are dreadful . Oops this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in . 	ES2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
454.0	I hope that clicks in , I'll just I'll hold it on , okay . 	ES2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
465.38	Hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . Okay , uh 	ES2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
553.66	There we go , hope that pen's gonna be okay . 	ES2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
779.78	Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you've got a little L_C_D_ display . 	ES2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
934.74	Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . 	ES2004a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
163.53	I can go first , yeah . 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
218.86	So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
262.14	Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
379.96	Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[interf, interface]
460.63	Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically . 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
495.15	Um so i in my personal preferences um I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . That's about it . So anything that you would like to know or 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ke]
612.24	I it'll take some time . 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
630.38	Oh , there it is , yeah . It'll come up , it um uh no signal . 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1003.5	Yeah , and it'll make the costs yeah . 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1117.24	try to press oh , okay , yep . 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1561.54	Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , so if you want to put in something stylish , then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , yeah . 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1750.76	Yeah . But how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh h ho how good is it , you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1850.65	What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , some kind of 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1955.35	Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl I mean it'll it'll mm . 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1974.55	Mm . So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is . 	ES2006b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
27.14	We may do . 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
292.03	Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it . 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ge]
784.16	Upper management said yes . Uh e excuse that , that's a bit of spam . 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Upper]
843.46	I'd I'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well , but wi with a similar 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1058.64	dock to put it in to to charge it . We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things . It s i m makes it easy to market , it's easy to differentiate the product , yeah so . 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1084.88	So if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1228.83	decide on well y you guys basically have to now go and 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1574.26	Other than click click click . 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1657.51	Well that's quite cool . You'd need a display on the th the thing . 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1752.47	Just the lights behind the buttons . You could have back-lit buttons maybe . 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1780.24	And if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that you know if it's actually pressed or not . I've seen some remotes do that . 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1887.17	on the other hand I would think , 	IS1002c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
148.12	quickly give you 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
194.02	enable us to complete the project in time . We're gonna have uh effectively two pages , a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted , and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
212.8	meet the technical requirements . And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . So . 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
732.69	Mm-mm . But is there any other I mean okay , that's true for the for for that element , but we have to take all el elements into consideration . And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . S 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm, mm, el]
870.55	Oh . So okay . Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple . And so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much . Would that be 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
915.27	And then have to change all change everything at the last minute . 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1092.11	Anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1171.9	So you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature . And you were talking 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1238.88	So that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down . 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1286.98	Yeah . You could have volume up and volume Volume up , down and Like that . And 'cause the idea was to have limited um it was to have sizable amount of information on it . Limited number of buttons . 'Cause it was sixteen buttons , wasn't it that were 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Volume]
1555.49	But what are they gonna be next Yeah . What are they gonna be next year . But but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever . That means you're constantly changing your production schedule , and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else , so that's not a good idea I would I would suggest . 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	True	[next, year, year, next, year, 's]	[]	[y]
1942.23	If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case . 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2248.42	Okay . So that's that , I guess . We should now go away and get these things sorted out . I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever . Okay , so um . 	ES2014c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
84.39	And Indeed . So they can see our faces . Okay . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
110.99	Uh this is the agenda for today . Uh first a little opening . Uh I will introduce myself , uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
178.95	They uh they wanna do something else . I w Uh there must be a new remote control . Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . That's two things really uh close to each other . But at the same time uh user-friendly . And they have uh Yeah , that's uh very important uh for them . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
248.65	Okay , the tool training . We have two smart boards . This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had . Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing . So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme . This is called a smart board 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint, Word]
321.47	Okay . Uh little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
329.76	At uh the white board on the left . Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal , and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[white, board]
404.12	You must p p uh push a little uh Good . Because And uh wait uh wait a few seconds . It's not uh fully real-time , so uh watch it . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
480.43	Yeah , you can guess what it is . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
486.45	May uh paint uh next . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
567.88	So choose a colour , choose a pen width and draw a 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
576.74	Save it , okay . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
757.15	And then you have the the current colour , you can change . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1030.88	we can sell our r remotes to . At least that uh countries which have uh a television . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1042.25	So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1062.72	Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little . I'm gonna join you at the table . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1140.33	Oh , that pen drawings . Uh no , I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there . Yeah . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Word, Shared, Documents]
1268.07	So yeah , I I agree with you . So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1332.84	Okay , uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . Um the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
1437.64	Will come in handy . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1496.18	So uh each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1511.67	I must finish off now , so it's over . You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach . And I see you in uh thirty minutes . Thank you . 	TS3007a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
134.64	Yes , maybe we should phone him . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
195.49	so maybe Anna , you can have your presentation . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Anna]
216.53	Great . Great . Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
426.46	Mm-hmm . Yeah no you can carry on , I just 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
430.15	look how it feels all . Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
435.49	Just I'm I really want to talk to it . But . So but but continue with your uh mm-hmm . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
731.97	do it quickly if if we al already . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
836.66	And then I mean w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half Euro and 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[this, four, and, a, half]	[]	[w, w, w, Euro]
912.53	Um well w w we can still discuss that . So um , and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive , but 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
943.48	No okay , this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
961.6	So maybe we can start with this , uh , calling this one . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
996.77	Okay . So . Look and feel . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1016.44	purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . But that's just half , we should also consider look , and then 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1040.51	So maybe two . Hmm . Hmm . Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ma, ma, ma, ma]
1074.02	'Kay . Can you maybe fix the other 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
1109.74	Mm , try it , just try it . Oh it will not ri mm , mm . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm, mm]
1523.53	Mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm, w, w, w]
1534.05	But as it is now , I w would say 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1628.72	Wh what what 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1716.4	And the then we can al yes . We can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[al]
1758.69	Maybe we can but we have to decide it , we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers and s now try to invest in the in in the features . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1837.94	Say , say one and two . One and two . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1858.23	Just add it . You know . Three , six , seven . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[six, ,, seven]	[]	[]
1881.87	We we must try to get them closer . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1885.38	Both in i i or we just have to choose . And adapt . Because , when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap . 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1933.19	Well yes , well uh re reconsider it . So let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , uh what kind of energy source uh I I we didn't speak about that . It's a it's a normal battery , or 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1998.84	Oh yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape , but , actually bu 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2076.43	So I think but th do you agree th that thi 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2236.6	Say say it's regular , regular chip , and we still on fifteen , so 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2248.13	Well we can just say 	IS1000d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
661.9	Okay , now you can go to to my slides , but actually what I pre what I have prepared is just a kind of a review of fo uh se six or seven movies , if you ca can go to the second slide . 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
724.93	Finally I found actually your table much better than my than my presentation , because perhaps here we can we can really see I mean 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
889.65	It's one of the candidates , I defini yeah , Steven Spielberg is really quite a good so I director , so I I would say we we could think about it . So I would keep it as a candidate , at least . 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Steven, Spielberg]
1041.78	I fully agree that you can see this movie three times perhaps , three times and for the fourth time see you still discover something new , but uh on the other hand , I have the impression it's really it's uh , you know , every everyone saw it , it's it's quite well known , uh it woul it wou I 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1091.14	When going through we c we could just eliminate . Okay , so we are not gonna eliminate this one . Uh Goodfellas , I didn't see it . 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Goodfellas]
1099.56	No . But you can read the comment from the users , uh that's the that's the last uh bullet point , and it says uh simply a masterpiece uh , and it's uh Scorsese's last really great movie to date . 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Scorsese]
1305.11	I've I've see I've seen it , but I can't really remember exactly the all the details . 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1350.34	So American Beauty , so I can perhaps read a little bit the user comment if you want , or uh yeah , you can read the plot outline on the on the on the projector , but it's basically deep , wonderful and penetrating movie , extraordinary uh irony and the p and the psychological drama about American life . 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[American, Beauty]
1473.66	Um what do you think , I mean what should we how we should uh 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1938.96	Yeah , but in the end you can ref yes . 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2021.97	If he would kill him , he wouldn't die . Wow . Tom Hanks wouldn't die . 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Tom, Hanks]
2489.25	Yeah , but I on the contrary I would say there is too many colours and uh it's difficult to read and uh 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2570.27	If if they fit there if they fit there , you will see . 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2599.5	So I'm really convinced by The Big Lebowski . I yes , yeah , I I would like to uh , yeah , at least to have it uh in the 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Big, Lebowski]
2776.15	Yeah , and I would eliminate 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2780.07	Yeah . And I would eliminate Pulp Fiction actually as well if so 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pulp, Fiction]
2827.97	Make a decision . 	IB4010.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
158.61	Well everybody already has his presentation , so you can adjust it . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
476.13	Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . There are some uh examples of remote controls . You can see they are very different . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[medsa]	[teletext, C_D, _]
611.66	You must still have it open . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
996.96	Then it should have uh on , off , and uh 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1056.6	Yeah , so you should have that one on . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1191.65	Oh , yeah alright . So you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1319.48	Well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's uh too expensive . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1446.81	We should think of the twelve fifty we have but 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1536.87	But you'll also forget to put it in , because you throw it on the couch and you don't remember . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1670.88	Yeah . W I know let's do a speech . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1681.09	You can clap or something . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1788.52	Yeah you can use icons for the 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1841.1	You could use that n as an option , if you have money left , or something . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1846.64	Yeah . Let's do speech . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1950.27	You'll have to search for it . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1987.0	Yeah , you could look here all the the 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2021.08	Or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and yeah . But that should also be a sub then , a sub uh menu thing . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2030.8	Yeah , so we should also implement se screen settings . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2040.28	Yeah , so you can program the 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2079.33	And do we want them in different colours , or 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2102.23	Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones . You can uh But I don't think that uh 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2145.19	Oh yeah , right . So you can program the T_V_ . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
2150.9	Perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile . So , options , and then you sub them . Otherwise you have all those teletext , perhaps teletext not , but 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2293.48	Yeah , yeah . To turn it on . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2298.23	Of or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
2312.24	Well I I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you uh you you then turn it , and then the T_V_ goes on . But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, T_V]
2353.2	If we can afford it . 	TS3005b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
65.79	Uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . Uh this is the power key , um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on . 	ES2012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
89.76	Uh that's the little menu key . This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it'll still understand . Um the logo is down down there um and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . Um . 	ES2012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
187.05	Yeah it could stand , yeah . Well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that . 	ES2012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
203.97	Yeah , we could just widen it out uh 	ES2012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
219.05	Mm , yeah , yeah . Have to if we just lengthen it I guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there . 	ES2012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
232.31	We might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that . Yeah . 	ES2012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
249.29	The final product would actually stand up , yeah . 	ES2012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
644.25	Yeah I'd say definitely a one yeah . 	ES2012d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
288.72	Let's see . Good job I got pockets today . 	ES2014a.C.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
359.65	Um and they can look after themselves . 	ES2014a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
0.02	I'll wait until you're all um hooked up . 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
52.39	Put it on in that way . Thanks . 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
116.64	to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
361.49	let's start from the inside and work our way out . 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
816.29	Well add it in to think about um 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1169.94	So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off . 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[fascia, fascia]
1312.35	I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1350.45	It would have to be attached . 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1374.37	Okay , we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that . That's you , right okay . 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1635.33	That's what I was just saying , and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls , so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that , on the lower side . Okay . 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1811.45	Yeah . Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[li]
2094.28	And you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2116.3	And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes y you know , you could just go so far with it , like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so I think that's quite a flexible thing . 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2235.57	Well they do , but I think we can you could well it is , it is , I think you just address that with um advertising . Um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does , without that so I'm not worried about that . 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2277.63	um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards . Right I'm going to wrap it up there . 	ES2004c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
176.5	Okay , yeah I'll go first . Can I grab the 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
249.03	Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
325.58	Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries , they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . Yeah the the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across . Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
443.35	which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[I_R, _, T_V, _]
1108.34	Yeah . If yeah and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so . 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sky]
1188.63	Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so I thought that could be quite a 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1647.81	Just whack in the number . 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1702.08	Mm . Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series . 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y, Sky]
1879.56	Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1933.38	Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine , and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time . 	ES2004b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
236.26	You put it uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons . And you But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel . S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[t]
334.76	Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh Yeah . But m Yeah . We disc discuss that already . But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option . So uh they just put in uh put press uh the button and uh 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
396.21	Yeah yeah . Just to recognise it , so uh 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
403.56	Y uh s some uh remote controls uh do it also , but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it . Uh so 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
467.88	Yeah we can u just uh 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
889.32	attractive uh o options . So uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . So 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1318.4	But uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one . Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . It uh it's a bit uh 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2150.07	But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation , it's easier to uh share it with uh other people . Uh so uh you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet , or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory . So 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2182.2	T can uh can you export it uh like a Yeah . 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2228.3	Um , yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2527.21	Uh maybe uh they will save it . So uh 	TS3003d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
565.72	I just have a question about that . Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have a certain number of favourites um and that w 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[say, B_B_C, _]
635.07	Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , you know , hundred and fifty pounds or something . 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
701.87	Well , another thought I oh , sorry , go ahead . 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
851.17	Well , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing . 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
923.99	Let's see . 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1004.81	Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like . So just kind of minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator . 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1510.74	Yeah , just another five Euro to get 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
1681.48	Well I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse . So that , you know , when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1702.14	have the power , wherever , somewhere . 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1796.96	Yeah , and just say 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1857.16	So I guess we could have a menu button as well . We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume . 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1889.5	Yeah , press that is t yeah , that might work . Yeah , it's like um yeah , it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . You just press it . 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1900.0	Yeah , and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select . 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2172.54	So you could use like this and it would go . 	ES2012c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
449.32	Seal , a seal . 	TS3005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
547.94	Make that cute . 	TS3005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
883.43	to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em . 	TS3005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y, y]
938.89	Yeah , uh teletext . think so . Okay . 	TS3005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[teletext]
1004.37	to make it user friendly . So uh I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control , they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television . So uh it only has to have uh the most used buttons . You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television . In those in that 	TS3005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1116.8	So we should take that in consideration . 	TS3005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1125.57	Oh mm , no . Things'll come up . 	TS3005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Things'll]
1162.32	Stop the meeting now . 	TS3005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1187.12	No , the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design , and the in uh usability interaction Yeah , okay . Okay . 	TS3005a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
635.44	Yeah s then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together . 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
651.57	Yeah so I'll I'll go with that actually so um 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
671.11	Okay so m so then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms , and uh they could be like buttons or like and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do . So what I have found was that uh currently uh the they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have and uh 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, V_C_R, V_C_R, w, w]
752.42	There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , like You can basically if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information . 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[V_C_R, T_V, T_V]
905.38	I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote , is uh um is a good idea , like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that , you know , and uh 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[u, s, Joe]
1002.02	Yeah you can let them to do that . 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1012.87	N no but the if you give it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . Like for example uh I would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint . So it de 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[N]
1109.62	We well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can uh check how much how much they yeah yeah yeah . 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1121.23	Maybe we can come we we can talk to them , and we can come with that , you know . And also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , so you really need a some kind of indicator , so it could be a blinking option of L_E_D_ it could actually be used to detect also . If it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also . 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[che, _]
1176.17	It may need more actually , so y you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit . And then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something and it can change the colour depending on your uh how much is the battery , well that is good enough to even locate even if you want to . 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1214.85	Sure you can you know . 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1557.76	What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1574.53	Okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card . 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1744.21	Yeah we we can give a preference to them , but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1847.56	We can give them smooth keys , you know . 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1858.63	The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together to 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1875.83	Oh you can actually , for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here , and uh now you can , for example , as I was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . At the same time , it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this R_S_I_ and all problem . Uh big keys may better for them actually and uh 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1981.94	We should make a 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1988.83	Yeah that would depend upon us actually . 	IS1000c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
155.76	No , no . The time the time is still in there . But you'll get uh what you want is to figure out what are the um the concepts behind that data that you want represented . So rather than saying the eye was at this particular place , you know , here , and then a tenth of a second later here and then a tenth of a second later here . You say there was a fixation from this time to that time and there was blink from this time to that time . And 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
729.69	Y you need to be able to see the effects of this . So I g I guess this is a case of Craig writing some scripts so Robin having some ideas about what the relationship is and saying , you know , add this data a automatically . It I mean it's not that hard , right . It's just there'll be a bunch of these , you'll have some rules about how maybe how long you spend on other objects and w whether the other object is um the existing construction or not , right . And so um 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y, Craig, Robin]
962.55	I could believe them , yeah , no , taking an interest in that . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1008.97	Well yeah . But I mean with transaction coding on something like this you would use i y you wouldn't consider it verbal analysis exactly . It'd be verbal plus action . Because it's a task breakdown . It's just a segmentation . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1225.66	Um but the hard part is knowing how you wanna do that . And I I think in the first instance what we're trying to get into the G_D_F_ format is just this . And then we've got no option but to uh figure out a way for like to look at this , just explore this data , suggest ways about doing it and um be able to play them back and see um when we think we've got these things right . I don't think we even know what the set of these things are that we want , much less how to get 'em yet . So th 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[G_D_F, _]
1275.61	Yeah . So let's just return to this question of frame rate . Because this is the thing we were not planning to um transfer into this format . So again , you know , what a frame rate kind kind of coding is ag it can again be seen as a track . But it says it's a coding like this , right , where you say it's in state A_ , state B_ , state C_ , state A_ . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ag, A, _, state, B, _, C, _, state, A, _]
1369.7	Fixations and the percentage of time those fixations cover , you might want . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1573.53	Okay . So it's the number of fixations the did you want the you 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1614.46	And uh y did you want the percentage of time fixated as opposed to which is sort of another view of this number . You can have as many of these as 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1807.04	Yeah , but i in in the analysis you should treat those as completely separate tracks of information . Because they can be looking at they could look sim simultaneously at somebody's mouse , somebody's gaze and some object , right . So 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1822.8	Yeah . So the these are independent . So so what we want is whether they're looking at s at the other person's gaze , right , and say they are in this period well , I mean uh they're probably not given what I've trying to 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2293.02	Well we'll see if ELAN likes it or not . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ELAN]
2297.81	Yeah , and we b we better also like have in the representational list of par like even in the N_X_T_ up-translation a list of parts . It it affects the way we do the N_X_T_ u up-translation and make things easier for people . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[N_X_T, N_X_T]	[_, _, u]
2574.75	Mm-hmm . That'll cover most of 'em . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2888.5	I think we've gotten to the point where , you know , to try to summarise , uh we we think Tim's program can do both of these conditions that you want . But I'm still worried about what the uh effects are for analysis . Because you were aiming at something in um the G_D_F_ format and I wasn't quite sure what . And w 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Tim, G_D_F, _]
2919.36	Yeah . So so okay . So I'll summarise what we said about that part that um every time you cast off a new part from a mold or , you know , every black triangle has a different I_D_ . And you know it's a black triangle 'cause you know which mold it came from . But you don't know which part it was intended to replace on the screen , because you can't mind-read . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[I_D]
3131.64	Yeah . So we can easily look at things like that automatically . It's just the why they g why they get new parts that's the problem for us . We can't if they suddenly if they decide to get a part of a mold we don't know we can't know why until they do something with it , if they do . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3212.23	'Cause you know what they're gonna do with it . When they decide to move it past the mold line , they're p doing something with it probably and you'll know what they're gonna do with it because 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3278.4	So uh that's gonna particularly be a problem for J_P_ , right . Remember m all the things we're looking at are f with language with and without language . And it's gonna be very difficult to tell whether they broke something intentionally without the language . Which means it's probably not 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[J_P, _]
3295.72	Yeah , okay . But th um this is properly part of the action coding . So we should well we should make a wish list , right , as a side effect . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3336.82	Mm . they could discuss deciding to break something and and then one guy does it . Yeah , yeah . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3589.3	You can dump 'em into one video frame if you don't mind losing resolution . But that's maybe a problem , right , because 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3701.47	Oh okay . So you so you should start the Camtasia really early then . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Camtasia]	[]
3953.04	Right , so we can either adjust the eye trai track data or we can actually chop the audio signal to take off the first whatever , however many seconds . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4121.85	'Cause , you know , people might wanna use this for speech recognition or something . You never know if it's the data is there then 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4500.09	But I think the thing to do is um for you to go away and think about it this way with the different tracks for the different objects and the um the kinds of things we've added about whether they're looking at the other person's gaze and what have you , and and try to change the spec so it it reflects this and maybe um oh maybe by that point there will be some sample data or something uh and the right thing to do is for us to look at the sp the spec the way you understand it now and some data . And then Ellen'll have new ideas about what's needed or about these post-analyses , you know , the and then and we can add 'em in . But it's gonna emerge over time . I mean that's clear . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ellen'll]
4658.09	'Cause he that's what he said to us originally . So I would assume , you know , no more contact with Joe . It's not fair to get work out of somebody for free . So you know , ask Craig instead . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Joe, Craig]
4711.64	Yeah . I if he can give it , you know , like because the problem is you gotta have an immediately when you discover a bug in that . And we can make Craig shift all his other priorities to do this 'cause we bought him . Right . Yeah . So it's a kinder way . It yeah . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Craig]
4764.92	You can cold call her today , this afternoon . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
4818.36	That's her job . Come on . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4962.84	See , 'cause you're supposed to uh have training in 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
5113.1	Well I can just leave you guys here , you know . 	EN2009d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
803.36	Mm yeah , you can do that , yeah . 	IN1016.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1300.28	Yeah . Go on . Yeah , it's no problem . 	IN1016.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1625.88	No , the boss . Like have a it's like instead of saying like you should like work on both side , you know , the text and the speech aspect of it . So yeah . 	IN1016.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1702.52	Uh w one thing interesting is what we came up in the discussion also you about telling that uh detecting such scenarios where there is no relation between the slide and the person talking , that may be one good starting point for you actually . And then at that point y uh you detect something like that and then you show something like uh what you are saying that i if there is uh if uh there i if it is out of discussion , the words are no way are going to help your recognition anyway , A_S_R_ . 	IN1016.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
2093.17	No , it it's it's uh quite a bit , yeah , problem , to do that kind of thing . 	IN1016.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2122.83	Yeah , but probably we were the f you know , the post uh the the thing is somewhere projector . Suppose there's like the the white-board or whatever , the presentation is over there , the speaker is more probably is going to this way or that way . So probably you you may not need a very big microphone either . Probably one or two . uh uh ye uh yeah . Uh yeah . 	IN1016.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2286.49	Yeah . So so probably we can yeah . CHIL may be interesting actually . You can look at it . 	IN1016.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[CHIL]

3135.28	Uh the they are uh the scri because up to uh probably maybe we shall do mm it yeah . Uh for to make it faster we should ru it run maybe . If we run f we ourself it it's very fast . Uh yeah . 	IN1016.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[scri]
3405.68	Uh . Yeah , it can go there , yeah . 	IN1016.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3411.54	See 	IN1016.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3415.33	No , no , no . I think it's uh it's good if he submits his pr proposal . As a research report you put here , submit it for the conference . It's quite good for the proposal directly . Yeah . Yeah . 	IN1016.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
43.88	Alright . Okay , let's go . So , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes . 	IS1004a.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
73.27	Okay , very good . Thanks for being here . Um so let's have a look to the the agenda . 	IS1004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
81.71	So , we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here . Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it . 	IS1004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
123.88	As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company . It is in three step as you know . First the functional design . The second's a conceptual design , and then the detailed design . 	IS1004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
140.97	During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next . 	IS1004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
605.3	Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants . 	IS1004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
611.44	So so another important part of the project is about money , uh and about so about finances . So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control 	IS1004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
629.16	and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros , okay . And we should target the inter an international market . 	IS1004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
653.12	O this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly , so let's go to it . 	IS1004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
734.46	So we need to close the meeting . Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do . 	IS1004a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
67.88	I'll just put that there . Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . Uh I'm Nick Debusk , I'm the Project Manager . Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um . 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nick, Debusk, Project, Manager]
93.67	Go ahead . 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
303.04	Um do we have um 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
309.66	any ideas of of maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
400.16	So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
616.22	marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there . 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
676.22	We want it to be a b a ball , you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located . 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
803.64	How would we go about um 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
877.3	So if no , go ahead . 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
951.7	So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better . But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1030.55	Let's see here . 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1068.2	you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way . Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1357.77	Must finish now , so . And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want . 	ES2016a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
431.48	Um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
481.57	Yeah this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip . But 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w, f]
594.64	Click , don't Yeah . 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
767.49	Um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know . 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1144.12	Then your lights would go off , though . 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1269.18	Mm you can just click . 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1429.37	I have an idea . And it's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it's a common issue . 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1467.39	and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . You never have to get go through the go through uh all these different batteries . 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1505.28	It w it would increase the cost . 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1513.56	And you could page the remote if you lose it . Maybe there's a button on the cradle . 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1541.93	what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers . 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ho, Pedro]
1618.82	But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have . 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2084.18	Yeah we we need to , I mean , have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is , you know , the best fit . I think w what's really important is it has to look good , it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand , it has to be durable , it has to a and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap . I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote . Even though the cost may be low . 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2159.11	just to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up . Um I really un unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , 	IS1002b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[un]
103.62	I can hold it like 	ES2004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
337.51	So when it's even if it's open here , the signals would go . Yeah . 	ES2004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
404.82	Look up to it . 	ES2004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
653.18	I would say four . Mm-hmm . 	ES2004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1227.56	No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , we can put point five . 	ES2004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1235.49	I think it allows the point five , yeah . We can use that . 	ES2004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1516.96	Make it costly . 	ES2004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1921.75	Yep , sorry , go on Sarah . 	ES2004d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sarah]
204.33	I'll just um I'll grab the wire out the back of this one . 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
243.9	Control 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
361.16	Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply . 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
391.17	Whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary . We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that . Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . And then the sender , which um 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
442.28	I'll just go through there . 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
954.6	I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1344.12	And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1436.0	you could have an option to turn it off . Or 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1442.35	So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
1728.18	Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , and if something comes back 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1774.54	I'd go more Yeah , f more for clap . 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1804.74	Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1827.94	I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers . 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2022.1	Keep the other buttons but hide them away . 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2070.95	Should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[the, next, couple, of, minutes]	[]	[]
2128.33	We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by . 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2148.2	Okay , so we'll have um 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2198.31	Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2221.64	Um up Tune one way , tune the o I I dunno I dunno possibly . 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2290.28	Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2296.68	Well shall we look into that and just get back together . 	ES2014b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
798.37	Yeah , it's strange , with so many votes that they can p shift . I mean statistically speaking it's strange . 	IB4011.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1341.88	Well it's very strange , you could s ask this for any sad movie , did you enjoy it . Well I didn't really enjoy to see bad things , but uh I think it was satisfying to see that , well , how dramatic things are . Yeah . Exactly , yeah . I it's very moving , I it's true , it's not very it's not very , well , happy . I don't know how it would compare with Apocalypse Now , if it's darker or maybe 	IB4011.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Apocalypse]
1369.79	Yeah . So yeah , so I think this would continue a bit our our theme . So the the movie is ranked quite high , if I if I refer back to your table it's number uh , what actually , um fourteen . Quite a lot of votes , so um also one of the the mainstream movies . Um on the second page uh of my notes I well I quoted some uh well some facts about the movie that I found interesting , we we could use them for either a poster or uh or a presentation . Um especially I enjoyed the story about the the colour saturation . It's true that the movie is not really black and white , uh but uh the colours are grey-ish , dark-ish , it it prov it makes a very moving effect . 	IB4011.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[grey]
2040.55	Yeah , let's nominate first . 	IB4011.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2065.27	Well I'll nominate the one I proposed , Saving Private Ryan , so history , war , drem drama . And I haven't seen it , but I would like to see it and I think American Beauty . 	IB4011.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Saving, Private, Ryan, drem, American, Beauty]
2148.84	Oh yeah , um well it's uh well if I nominated two and I was the only one , I'll give two points to Saving Private Ryan and one to American Beauty . 	IB4011.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Saving, Private, Ryan, American, Beauty]
2177.33	Okay . That makes the vote more complicated . Um okay , so I'll give um uh b um 	IB4011.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2269.03	Maybe you can leave those . 	IB4011.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2277.92	Oh leave Julianne Moore . 	IB4011.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Julianne, Moore]
2324.28	So uh we'll try a movie from the two thousands . 	IB4011.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2375.99	Let's cross the bridge when we get to it . 	IB4011.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
712.87	Horns , draw some horns . 	ES2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1139.08	there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , maybe to do 	ES2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1145.93	So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . Hmm . 	ES2006a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
211.0	Okay , welcome everyone to our next meeting . I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder , 	TS3005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
245.44	which was quite some typing . Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . Okay , well 	TS3005c.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
272.83	Well , take it away . 	TS3005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1421.96	Okay well maybe , if I can interrupt you , maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision . 	TS3005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1430.63	So we can discuss these points . 	TS3005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1437.95	energy question mark . How how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it . Uh chip on print and case . Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here , but I hope you have ideas about them . 	TS3005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2297.62	Yeah I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue , just 	TS3005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2350.66	Well I I'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out . I don't know . Okay well that was what I had to say , uh , 	TS3005c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
10.25	Unless uh things have suddenly change again . 	TS3011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
301.75	Probably watch too much Sponge Bob . 	TS3011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sponge, Bob]
429.94	and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . 	TS3011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
439.0	So we could provide 	TS3011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1139.96	Uh well , it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers . 	TS3011c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
14.22	She did admit it . Yes . Uh-huh . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
94.84	Yeah . We're doing a bit . See last week by the time everything and and then it'll be hopefully no more than , I don't know what , twenty minutes today to 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[last, week, today]	[]	[]
314.01	Yep , make sure it uh it starts and finishes when it's meant to and that sort of thing as well . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
466.55	Want it a reasonable size so that if they're looking at it we know they're looking at it though . So you has to be a a reasonable target uh for the for the tracking purposes . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
548.04	And basically the parallelogram was appearing in a sort of as a mirror image of what it was like in the uh model builder in the actual yeah . Just total it flipped uh in in a mirror image . Not rotated . So it wasn't anything to do with rotation . It was f yeah , just the parallelogram . So uh entirely sure . Must be some way of how the vertices were described or uh defined in one way or compared to something else . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
772.95	I y yeah , but that's why uh we no , we'll only be working as I say with sort of solid obvious polygons and as parts . 'Cause they'll have they'll have to have a central point anyway for for rotation and and grabbing . But 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
794.91	Well uh uh realise what we're I would consider that two parts , yep . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
984.7	And I've uh sent a thing off to Marloes talk trying to encourage her again to register for the C_S_V_ and uh and what to the C_V_S_ and uh wha what to do and uh which bit of software I use that seems to be quite easy and simple . Yep . Nope . Well yes and no , as in yes , it's new , and no , I haven't got a problem . Yep . Oh so far . Yeah . Uh-huh . Uh y yes . Uh and I am just using it through um a Windows bolt-on sort of piece of software . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Marloes, C_V_S, _, Windows]
1286.58	Spend . Mm-hmm . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1332.21	Uh what el uh well I'll have to get to grips with cra Camtasia uh properly uh to generate a little sort of introductory video I suppose uh for instructional purposes at the beginning of the experiment . So people will be able to see uh and so that the p you know , example movements uh and things like that will be 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[Camtasia]	[el, cra]
1533.02	Actually I I did email Nijmegen to ask if they'd had a set of instructions they'd given their participants , but it probably I s I suspect so because I haven't had a reply back . Yeah , too too uh it was just in case they had something that what 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nijmegen]
1657.61	Mm-hmm . Uh I'll try I'll try . You never know what's what's out there . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1739.3	I'll try and find out . I don't know off off hand certainly . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1747.18	Uh I'll I'll do a search . B um I've not encountered them . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1846.82	As little as it is , but yeah . Yeah . Yes . Have to 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1854.91	To try and , yes , and home home in parameters and choose the right sort of settings . So yep . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2160.96	That filter Mm yeah , filter out . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
2185.86	To do . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2192.5	Hmm . Watch out Well I think according to the latest documentation uh you're down for five percent of your fifteen months on this project or something . Some b uh JAST report . Officially . Into reality , uh-huh . 	EN2009b.C.words.xml	True	[fifteen, months]	[]	[JAST]
5.03	Yeah , sure . It kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background . Everything I have is kinda background . 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
144.55	Come on . I think it's working . 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
148.57	Okay great s so let me just start this . 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
156.63	Okay great . So um uh s move on . 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
182.46	I think I just opened up the template . Sorry about that . Okay alright so let's have a look here . Okay so this was the method that um I've taken . Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
199.16	And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
209.14	Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project . 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
288.35	So it I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that I think um what we should think about is how the um 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
383.17	And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour . Um 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[last, year, last, year, 's]	[]	[]
579.96	covers or something so . Anyway those are that's all I have , but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1371.73	Illuminate the buttons . Yeah it glows . 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1551.64	Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour , you said company colour yellow . I mean if we think of something , like I was saying also lime and lemon you know , what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1664.45	Um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1670.31	Can you like yeah just t we can visualize it . 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1785.21	L_C_ well I'd when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about . And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings . So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C, y]
1943.36	Support for it . I mean just it's just worth pointing out because like I've I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery . 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1997.15	And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small . 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2311.16	Something a bit more flush , yeah , or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well , so that it has and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . 	ES2002c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
231.83	Like does it feel good , like yeah , physically . 	ES2010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
305.18	Oh wait , that's false . 	ES2010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
360.28	I'll give it a two . 	ES2010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
433.68	Well yeah , so I'd give it a two . 	ES2010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
453.0	So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , and uh hopefully we'll sell millions . Good job , team . 	ES2010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[delicious]
537.59	Yeah , let's let's do a lithium . 	ES2010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
909.62	Look at it . That is a piece of work . Wow . Marketing Director says yeah . 	ES2010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Director]
917.37	Fashionable people will buy it . 	ES2010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
920.79	Oh , I will create desire . 	ES2010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
928.39	We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf . Mm . That'll sell . 	ES2010d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Adam, Eve]
182.76	Think I'll go first . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
229.36	Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
400.47	Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
417.57	Um this is certainly something to take into account . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
479.62	and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
496.55	So you'd know where it is in the room . And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
519.58	mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . But up till forty five it remains feasible . This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[the, age, of, sixteen, to, twenty, five]	[]	[]
577.42	Yeah you should go to the top thingy . Slide show . Oh yeah . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
886.27	Well it would certainly make a fancy design . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
897.09	We would have to look into that . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1300.7	what the remote control is like . They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1572.58	Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . I think many people like to use that . 'Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[channel]
1613.63	the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1624.2	do have that . If many T_V_s have that . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1723.04	That would that would cost a a big marketing 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1754.13	yeah I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1873.15	I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . Which would tell you what it does . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1915.19	that would fit into the 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2050.42	I'd have to look into that a little more . 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2069.67	'Kay . And with uh the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . You could I think we n it would be a lot easier to 	TS3003b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
251.63	You Yeah . Yeah , yeah , you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
427.18	Mm-hmm . But we'll return to that . Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . The chips made of silicon , I guess . I think that's the best uh way to do it . And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
519.11	discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
543.88	several examples of uh styles , so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
582.65	And uh well round shapes , primary colours . You can see it all here . And of course uh this famous device . I think as you know something uh some devices like this . So to give you an idea of uh 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
723.26	I'll draw it , but maybe later . And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh . Um anyway 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1148.45	Yeah I understand . Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1192.73	I can live with it . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1294.42	Exotic yeah . We have t Yeah , yeah . I will design it , we design it later . So we'll get to that later I guess . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1352.85	But uh we should decide now . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1476.39	According to my sources , uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1720.35	Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them , and and uh And uh 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1892.85	To make it as uh as round as possible . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1931.59	We we j we'll just give them an uh We'll design it , and then they can give comments on it . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1999.01	But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . The logo and the and the 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2024.38	Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board , and you can remove the front . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2057.19	I think it's a nice idea , to make it more recognisable , that the next to the logo you have the slogan . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2065.33	To make more uh of an impression . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2082.86	Lo Uh yeah . Or maybe here in the middle , but we'll decide later . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Lo]
2118.0	Do you do you see a bit of the of the um 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2173.07	A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone . Maybe you can show it . It also has the those two distinct uh 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2274.13	The high powers from above will have to tell us , yeah . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2286.99	We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote . No just kidding . Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too , because it becomes too too too too stressy . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2322.4	Bless you . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2401.16	the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , yeah . 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[green, board]
2415.74	Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it uh 	TS3009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
225.96	Um the red ones are for uh changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
277.78	Yeah yeah , that that'd be one way of doing it , yeah . That'd work , yeah . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
316.19	Let's pass . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
336.31	So that's our three prototypes . Um basically , in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
351.08	and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
538.42	Put an extra the button on . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
774.93	I'll go for two . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
788.1	I think it's it's functional , it's also pretty basic , so I'll give it a two . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
866.27	I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique , I mean it's it's just it is just pushbuttons um , so I I'd give it a four . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
898.48	I'll say one . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
924.12	Yeah I'd I'd give it a one . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1052.0	Yeah I'll I'll say two . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1101.78	once you've , yeah once you'd learned how to use it , I think it is a lot easier . So I'd I'd give it a four . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1152.07	Um I'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1187.81	I'll give it a two . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1331.05	Guess it's double-curved . It is pretty curvy . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1814.26	That's cool . Let's all let's all go for the yellow 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1818.2	Break the stem off . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2055.94	Uh we we worked together , um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , um and how we could like improve on the on the design . 	ES2008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
105.8	So it's being modified . Do you want yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . So , um yeah , this is my name . 	IS1006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
158.7	So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful . 	IS1006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
510.47	I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were had I think ten I think . 	IS1006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
540.36	That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . For instance I think net next slide . 	IS1006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
822.92	I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button . 	IS1006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1184.74	In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button . I uh 	IS1006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1208.89	Go to channel twenty five . One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping . 	IS1006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1281.09	Well I could could uh have a look at that maybe . I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . 	IS1006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1624.82	Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , and ha ha you cannot use my remote control , because it's targeted to me . Whatever . 	IS1006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1865.68	Yeah , of course . That's no problem , we will sell more . Yeah exactly . 	IS1006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2107.53	Oh that's e that already exists okay okay . Oh yeah , you do have . Wow . You're trendy . 	IS1006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2117.46	Think about it . Yeah , okay . 	IS1006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
26.78	Uh welcome back after lunch , I hope uh you had a good lunch 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
35.7	For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
89.29	little bit uh low , but I I hope we can finish it up so I'll handle to the 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
97.17	the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept . 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Christine]
616.86	Okay then , uh , let's move to Agnes . 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Agnes]
1223.46	Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh , countries like , uh , India yes , yes , countries like India or China or Malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[India, India, China, Malaysia]	[]
1276.72	So , but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking . 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[le, Ed]
1468.49	Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display . An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay . 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1481.32	how mu how much how much you can sell extra . 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1484.32	Of course you'll make money too , so it 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1497.17	So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then uh , then we can proceed from there . 	IS1008c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
346.55	Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and um that's about uh that's and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . 	IS1008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
372.18	Um well , I would th think that depends on how much money you give us . 	IS1008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
377.74	Um because uh , you know , you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models . 	IS1008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
402.66	Well , you know um , I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's uh very attractive that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own . So it would really would need to um something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , so um d uh you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool . 	IS1008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
447.86	Well , uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um and so I'll have to wait and see how those uh how those go . If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month . If um if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months . 	IS1008a.C.words.xml	True	[a, month, six, months]	[]	[]
565.62	Okay , I'll get back to you on that . 	IS1008a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
97.06	Yes , and place some slides . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
117.8	It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications . That's well , so that's that . Please , next slide . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
136.52	We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA , and uh made some real good Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that . And um , 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[NASA]
153.52	s society will accept that . For sure . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
189.94	And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
200.7	Please press it . Everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
209.41	s such a r such a device . So you can touch it with your hands . Sure . Yes . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
222.06	You must say it . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
233.52	Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course . , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
405.09	We are still working on titanium . So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ . You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[Tuesday]	[]	[L_C_D, Bob]
479.38	Let's make a party first maybe . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
647.14	Feel the weight . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
717.93	No . No . How can I say this . It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . A strawberry . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1052.26	Sure , sure , just look at it . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1058.64	Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1416.41	Well , as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[eng]
1432.89	to make electricity . Yeah , that you don't need a battery . So , it's something like hand dynamo robot . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1455.04	Why not . Let's do that . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1528.13	Now it's fancy , let's add one instead of two . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1775.2	So , we see , we can even forecast . 	IS1006d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
0.96	Wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings . Yeah . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
194.85	Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . To just have the sort of main same sort of idiom throughout kinda . So 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[kinda]
426.11	Actually yeah , like um another common thing , like if we have it so it's set up that um if you double-click and it goes to a default thing on the menu , I mean that's kind of a typical kinda action that would happen . If you double-click on a particular topic or something , then it goes to sort of a like a default view , so it'll be like all the um cases of that topic , either whatever we decide the default to be , whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting , and just show up the the particular instances of that topic in a meeting . Like I'm just thinking to have the default there , so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do and we know that that's the most common thing that's gonna happen , so the double-click will do that and so save them the trouble of right-clicking and choosing the item on the menu . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
466.05	Well , it might come to us as we start playing with it . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
471.44	Um like we have the the right-click menu . You'll have the menu , right-click it , but instead of like have a default double-click , so if there's a de so it'll be a choice from the menu but yeah , exactly . Yeah . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
615.39	I think we probably need that , though to have the f the full flexibility , we need to have that there , but um yeah . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
761.36	Yeah . Yeah , like a lot of these can be , like once we get the disfluencies out , then we can you know , have transcript without the disfluency , transcript with the disfluent disfluency . Have all these , you know , have all these sort of using the same window and so we can put a lot of and probably mutually um whate distinct , yeah . Exclusive , yeah . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
858.54	Yeah , so we can plug it in and 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
907.32	Well , if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable , then we c know the directory to get in then and just 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
932.61	Or you could just email to us . Okay , yeah , yeah , okay , right . Yeah , right , okay . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1022.55	Yeah . So you could probably just use that code , like that was behind the question she asked him earlier . Just You know , the re-using code and stuff was just like okay , good . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1044.22	Yeah , probably . We'll probably still have to do some other file manage while , I don't know , creation . Messing around still , though . Yeah . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1211.16	Okay . So . Yeah , I was thinking that we can probably get uh start attacking this seriously and then just um , yeah , hopefully have something by next week that we can sorta try integrating into the GUI . Okay . Think that should be possible . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[next, week]	[]	[GUI]
1272.77	Hmm . Well they did say it wasn't the most efficient . Very clearly , yeah . Yeah . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1576.52	Did we wanna meet before we talk to Steve next week . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[next, week]	[]	[Steve]
1582.98	Well , I dunno . We'll probably get some work done over the weekend , so I dunno if after D_N_L_G_ or something , maybe just have a little quick little update and just 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[the, weekend]	[]	[]
1593.85	Yeah . Well we can decide . Yeah , exactly . True . Yeah . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1600.37	Search . And well sure , why not . Couldn't be that hard . Well , it'll be , you know , still limited version of , you know , the next query search . But , no no . Won't be the whole thing then . Um like we can just decide sort of things that we do wanna do . Hmm . yeah . Well , actually most are just dialogue acts . And what else was there . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
1816.85	Yeah . Just like all the and seeing the code , and just sort of how just see the basics of what you've done . Like just get a a quick look over and just the basics . Yeah . Or like like , you know , the class paths all that sort of thing . Like just just say okay , well here's you know , everything's basic in set-up and then just yeah , just jump right in . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1845.02	Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I know . Well thing is , you know , if yeah , something like that could happen anytime 'cause uh yeah , like my schedule's like a class , break , class , break , class , you know , that sort of thing . So so yeah , I know , exactly , exactly , that's what I'm thinking . So something like that and then if I have a class I can run off and do whatever . Yeah . Okay . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1912.6	W we well we can get in through the through the the card the card door . Yeah . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1929.75	Okay . Just sort bang on it . Actually I was asking Steve about that , whether we can get in there . Whether he was gonna get us access into the 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Steve]
1953.94	A nice okay . That would come in handy , yeah . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1957.74	Hey , we could we could photo-copy our um assignment if we wanted to . Yeah . Well the comments I'm thinking . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2060.79	You can have it . Yeah . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2089.6	But most will probably want to go with defaults . 	EN2002a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
193.92	'Kay guys , take it away . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
415.43	Weemote . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
422.0	Wait what I w got in mind . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
468.04	Hmm . Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
548.98	An another idea . Uh , maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style . They'll please the elder users as well . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1082.75	Save as . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1093.8	do the the math . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1258.69	Okay , go on . Just go on . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1295.66	to sell . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1345.86	Daniel . Daniel , what do you think about Here . What do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station just apart from the from the thing , so that you can uh put uh 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Daniel, Daniel]
1460.54	But , wha 'Kay , look , what is the uh If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more . But 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay, Euro]
1474.47	does it have a lot of extra uh fun function more like 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1716.63	Okay , I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . Uh , you could have but uh , it was your first , no uh no disrespect or something , but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more . So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and Yeah . But 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2068.85	Yeah . May maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here . And draw it , and it's it's placed over there . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2176.26	'Kay , double-click it . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
2187.04	Double-click it . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2258.76	Polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , maybe a a l a little application like uh uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2311.32	Yeah , of course . But , uh you can still discuss about it , but but click it in an application , that's a lot easier to process . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2455.9	Yeah , but you can save it u the under another name . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2514.5	Yeah . Okay , go on . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2667.13	Save it . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2689.12	Example of children remote . Oh wait . Wait . 	TS3007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
142.08	So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ and then uh titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some , moving kind of thing . 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm, L_C_D]
260.88	Excuse me . 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
266.1	So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes . 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
294.82	Like you can have two curves . 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
376.45	We'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . And this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
431.59	Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
685.99	So maybe you can use in the end and 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
794.14	Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
837.98	Just they'll get few more 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
988.74	Yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1094.79	So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah . 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1553.49	Yeah , looking yeah fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . We can have t colours or this shape or at least yeah . 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1603.15	Look and feel de 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1640.02	So , can we highlight the specific features of our yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's we want to follow general trend . 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1666.42	So , do you think 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1718.53	Feature 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1746.17	Uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah . 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1753.88	Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1794.36	Yeah . Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1827.49	Even design . 	IS1006c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
531.65	But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Project, Manager]
842.68	Well , I should I think two , because the voice recorder is n not self learning . 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1085.84	Yeah , you must change the chip uh back . 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1088.56	You must change the chip back , Nils . 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Nils]
1185.53	Yeah or we could replace it 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1252.76	Well , I do think so . 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1257.75	feel . 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1279.8	We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think . 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1628.35	Well I I drew this . Mm . And I made a mistake . But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen . 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1734.58	to email , yeah . Email or chat or something . 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1843.58	Yeah , but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and uh 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1884.86	Yeah , we can go to the bar and uh with our newly earned money . 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2009.89	Close your laptop . 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2012.23	So she can see we're ready . 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2020.1	Yeah . Let's take this remote into uh production . 	TS3009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
185.28	'Kay , do you wanna open the 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
206.23	I'll do the notes . Yeah , thanks . 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
256.58	um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth . 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
293.93	And um so it was highly directional flash light that uh you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels c so I think um those are still requirements we have today , uh fifty years later . 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	True	[today, fifty, years, later]	[]	[]
313.6	And uh it was really a pioneering innovation , but it was uh sensitive to the sun , so that uh it would get would start off by the you'd get it would easily cause um problems . 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
350.22	And um it would uh y you'd you could throw it at things if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else . 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
404.42	I think um it could either be you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and um kind of blend in with things , so you didn't have to um uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user's home . 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
470.09	Run over it with a car . 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
931.35	So um might uh we can perhaps um do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost . 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
973.6	so that uh y you know sen send power to it . 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sen]
1161.52	Okay , we'll find that out . 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1670.09	You can object if you want to 	IS1008b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
328.95	But let's forget about it . It's just time-consuming , so we uh have to go on . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
451.69	Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I'll um show you our target audience or our target product users , customers . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
535.35	Furthermore , it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . Yeah , yeah right . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
554.96	A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room . So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . I dunno , maybe that's an idea . 'Cause it's uh a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . So 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
765.47	If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno . We have to uh 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
802.48	Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . So we might consider L_C_D_ screens . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, L_C_D]
828.62	to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . So you can Right . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
892.7	Maybe you can select it . So it uh inverts . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1091.18	Right . Make them big , make them easy to uh to press . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1143.25	It's a f it's a new feature , you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1165.88	Right , continue . Sorry . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1388.25	Yeah , that's a must . We must have that . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1398.27	We can make a symbol of the company right here . And if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on Yeah . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1409.36	Yeah , yeah . But let's not focus on the front . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1450.95	I've I've got another point . Um there are two target audi audiences , and we've uh chose for the younger one . Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . They are high high interested in feature . But they are more critical . Fo Yeah , critical . So The younger audience . So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Fo]
1518.77	Here , look at these numbers . The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1678.2	We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1726.67	We'll draw two , and then we'll see uh 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1841.24	I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1885.89	Alright , let's keep it central . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1936.07	You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1994.65	Frequency of uh button use . Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . You can see . So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Frequency]
2063.08	Right , just make some decisions . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2078.82	I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . Just uh you decide that , you decide that , and ready . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2236.49	Right . I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2295.22	Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh 	TS3009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
381.8	So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . 	ES2016d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
422.68	And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . With seven being false , we did not achieve that . 	ES2016d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
525.64	Um okay so , do you think , since we 	ES2016d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
573.5	I'd say that 	ES2016d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
835.97	I'd say we did . 	ES2016d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
893.55	Okay we'll say two point four two . 	ES2016d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
921.49	pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically . 	ES2016d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
960.92	Yeah we'll go with that . 	ES2016d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1165.0	It'd look really lovely . Yeah . 	ES2016d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1179.99	Leave it blank . 	ES2016d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
541.48	And the volume button will will become 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
641.86	users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven . 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
707.49	could evaluate the 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
731.35	Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
743.04	I would say seven . It's quite fancy . 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
803.16	I would say 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
894.87	I would say five . 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
979.78	I would say six . It's quite cheap actually . 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1060.68	So yeah upload the 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1083.09	would change your remote control for a n for a new one . 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1187.63	You are romantic , really . I would say two . 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1257.55	Do you want me to sum o I think it's not 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1509.55	Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here . 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1662.48	Okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy . Would yeah , would buy . 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1678.65	Ah would buy , yeah . Massively , yeah . 	IS1004d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1126.78	the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , so just to take that weight into account . 	ES2008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1154.41	The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . And then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . I don't know how much we agree with that . And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , tight material . And so that brings us to my personal preferences . Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding . Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so 	ES2008c.D.words.xml	True	[year, a, year]	[]	[]
1541.23	If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know . 	ES2008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1624.37	t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries . 	ES2008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1978.99	Yeah . And let's like see if we get anything else . I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . 	ES2008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
531.82	And we would have one very big thing off-line . And from that we would just select what we are displaying . 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
542.04	Yes . So for example you would um give a high value to those um sequences you want to display in the meeting series summary . And you just cut off . 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3406.6	Yeah , but I'd uh I would like to look at the frequency of words in my um in the regions of text I found out to be interesting . So I wouldn't need it . It it would have to be re-calculated only for my segments . 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3459.87	Yes . Yeah , yeah . So I would probably just concatenate all my um text chunks and then let's say m I will run over it . 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4296.15	So that's just changing two lines of code . And it would give you that . So 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4307.81	Um yeah . So far I extracted um the dura durations . But it's from the words file . So I could just um contatenate concatenate um the words instead of the durations , and it should I mean 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4334.26	I can try to do it and send it to you . Pe and you have a look at it , will it make sense for what you want . 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4354.56	Yeah , uh p I mean it I just let it run over all the files . So 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4382.18	What do you mean by diffe 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[diffe]
4492.11	Yes . But I I mean as um the start uh start times um start for each meeting at zero , you could just probably just um add the um final second time to the next meeting and so on and just put it all together . But then we would have to change um the information about who on which channel it was set , um to by which person it was set . And that is actually stored in another X_M_L_ document . 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L, _]
4559.6	Yeah , but I do it with Perl , it's just string manipulation . So I would I mean I would just 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Perl]
4620.19	Yeah , I can directly put it into uh just like 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4650.4	Yeah , they will just I will just take I would uh take over the names they have anyway . 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4688.1	Yeah , and do you want 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4824.86	Mm-hmm . Mm . So so um I will probably send um just one file of the first meeting um to all those who need it so that you can have a look whether that's what you want . 	EN2001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
582.13	We can have a duck tape casing . 	ES2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
590.6	It could go with the granola crowd . 	ES2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[granola]
653.79	the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um . 	ES2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[c, c, Joe]
1112.96	I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall . Sounds good . 	ES2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1652.77	Think then we're hitting our cost issue again . 	ES2009c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
161.79	Or you can put it in the shared folder . 	IS1007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
208.76	Yeah I think assign your uh roles . 	IS1007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
568.28	And I could talk to the T_V_ television itself . I need not have an 	IS1007a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1533.84	On my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda , and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that . However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . And uh what function , working design , how how does it work . So these are the two things we should come up wit with . So uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group . 	IS1009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1587.09	Now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but I think within the target group we have subgroups . We have we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands , so I think that's uh one group that's certainly important . Um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear . And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use . I mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not . 	IS1009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1710.54	And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at 	IS1009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1722.97	sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us 	IS1009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1909.27	That's right , and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for a few uh Francs or Euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know . 	IS1009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Francs, Euros]
1988.92	But I think I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody . If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that . 	IS1009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2004.74	Do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not . 	IS1009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2022.2	So hank you very much . 	IS1009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
373.2	Yeah . We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D]
559.25	So next one . function five . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
565.43	So I can use the button , the mouse maybe . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
639.11	Mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well . Touch screen , I mean . Next one . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm, L_C, mm]
714.55	mm yeah yeah . And then they also secure uh covers , to protect 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
758.79	Mm maybe useful for children , they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
829.35	Yeah . And uh , this is another one where you can uh the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[V, _, V, _]
865.49	Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . Yeah . So we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . And basically uh 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1044.01	Let's see the market demand . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1241.41	Yeah . If you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the L_C_D_ , after all the L_C_D_ just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ , maybe even better . So 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, L_C_D, _]
1285.81	Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1292.63	Yeah . So i is so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1303.76	Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time . Is i if i 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1313.93	Yeah . And also the cost for the speech recognition . Ask our R_ and D_ department . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D, _]
1325.01	Yeah . And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1568.4	Put it back at the charge . Yeah . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1602.12	Yeah . That we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . You never get it lost because uh every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1757.22	because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . If numbers , they're easy , but if name the channel by by name 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1845.77	You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel . So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[numbe, T_V]
1890.29	I I think that I have mm mm I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . So 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1979.94	Yeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that . 	IS1007c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
836.27	Go away . 	TS3008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
846.55	Come on . 	TS3008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1091.91	Well , w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . This is then the uh pear . I don't know the English word , so forget it . And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control , but m yeah . 	TS3008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1188.78	I'll close 'em down . Um , go away . 	TS3008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1751.81	draw really nicely over there . We can put the logo on our uh on our base station . Uh , yeah . And maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself . But , i 	TS3008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1795.87	Yeah , definitely . Just bring more designs on the market . 	TS3008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2170.57	Yeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever . 	TS3008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2297.5	You'll see in you email , I guess . 	TS3008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2313.08	Construct one , yeah . 	TS3008c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
244.4	Have them in stock . 	ES2007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
247.01	Make 'em more appealing as well . 	ES2007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
331.97	Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , . 	ES2007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
627.25	So we'll give it a 	ES2007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
757.71	So that's the evaluation , so I'd say 	ES2007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
910.64	Just start summarising now . 	ES2007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
914.26	You can reply to the same message . 	ES2007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
919.22	See summary , there . If you just reply to that one . 	ES2007d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
155.59	Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
163.17	And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . So uh can you go one page down , please . So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . So uh mm I'm thin uh I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
206.89	Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like . And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . Okay so can you go down uh 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
243.04	So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the . Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, _]
296.24	The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the T_V_ set . 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[qu, T_V, _]
664.36	I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[al, T_V, _]
789.79	So , we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
799.36	But we'll see . 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
919.1	And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1174.88	Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television . 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1190.9	Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	True	[a, few, years]	[]	[]
1224.38	Yeah , to desi well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . 	IS1007b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
222.25	This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . 	ES2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
271.18	Go ahead . 	ES2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
358.74	Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . 	ES2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1275.22	And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit . 	ES2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Play, Doh]
1583.12	Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because 	ES2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2000.41	I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , like c come on gimme something . 	ES2009d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
336.67	Take Mozilla . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mozilla]
377.25	you know , w um what scope one annotation would have . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
641.33	No , their their annotation of dialogue acts , and one um segment can have or one um of those word strings that are presented in one line can have several um dialogue acts annotated on it . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
798.96	Um to discourse marker , DIS F_ marker fi point five . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[DIS, F, fi]
805.38	Yeah , that's there no no , up up . Go up . Yeah , right . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
842.19	Yes . Um you can see whether there's somebody else or not . You can see that in the w um W_ point um first it's W_ point um five uh fifty four and then it's seventy six , so there are um this number of utterances of other speakers in-between . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w, _, _]
881.12	Yeah , I think we would have to have the same structure , one that points to it , where we tie together , all our information . So we would perhaps have to make one that's similar . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1080.13	make our file one of those lazy loaded . But I mean I've no real idea how that works . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1126.45	in the segments file it's really the very basic that have to be displayed for any thing . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1467.27	Because it would then say how it find that it's that speaker . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1868.81	But that would give the same value for one word every time I mean for for a specific word . Yeah , because then it would be quite easy to re-integrate it into such a 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2645.44	Yeah sure , but I could then if I if I have um the value for a segment , I would perhaps just give all the 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2682.12	I would probably somehow have to break it down to to that level , yeah . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2711.92	Yeah , probably somehow it should work that way . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2726.24	Yeah , but then okay , but th at that moment it would be better for me to just make it on a per-segment basis right way , and let her adapt it also to the segment basis . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3073.34	I'll probably look at it . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3086.47	Yeah , but it could mess up things quite considerably . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3416.74	Try uh try yeah . Mm-hmm . 	EN2001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
58.78	for the remote control . So . So let's see the what 	IS1007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
71.93	did you prepare . 	IS1007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1316.51	So let's remove it . 	IS1007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1414.21	Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be 	IS1007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _, L_C_D]
1569.86	I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh 	IS1007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1583.87	Yeah . Or ma yeah . Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , so mayb better if you have all this in the same 	IS1007d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
461.46	Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . Yeah , those which we get here nowadays it's very long . And um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . 	IS1009a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
97.09	Okay , I'll start . Can you open my presentation , please . 	IS1005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
121.94	Can you pass the mouse , please . Oh okay , that's fine . Okay . Um so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . Um 	IS1005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
898.13	Can I ask a question . 	IS1005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
939.09	You can cut the T_F_T_ screen . 	IS1005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_F_T, _]
1483.27	I'd like a shaped screen . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . 	IS1005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_F_T, _]
1728.54	We could use Velcro . 	IS1005c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Velcro]
164.56	our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . Maybe you can uh point them uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
262.19	Yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh yes . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
362.84	Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
529.47	it could work , but 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
566.53	But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Real, Real, Reaction, M_P]
595.34	Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
614.25	Yes , but we can make 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
624.05	No , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
630.57	When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
640.87	Just have to be big enough for the biggest 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
660.4	But it's flat it's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
699.27	the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . Then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
747.1	Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
757.9	But , it will also uh uh use batteries , and do we want to 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
797.88	Yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , so it will uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
920.43	I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own yes , you can make it in your own uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1156.22	But still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone , with the with 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1202.0	To put it on your head . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1275.23	Make it a two . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1277.55	When it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1513.26	The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip maybe . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[retriever]
1617.49	No , it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . If you use a scroll-wheel 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1630.71	Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons . You can have f four kind of push-buttons . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1635.85	Rubber . You can have uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1707.61	When you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . Board . And then throw it 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wi, Board]
1729.59	Uh , it's it's still for little children . They can handle that remote control , but but it isn't fo 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1805.74	But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station yes . And and but we don't have to tell it , but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2038.36	Ah , I've got it . I will put uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2176.49	We can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2230.35	Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2403.89	wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . Uh , so it's uh wireless technology . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2422.91	Look at the case , the case the case of of uh of uh 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2473.48	Maybe we can uh can do it both . Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2578.87	You can do it for fifty cents . 	TS3008d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
617.75	Need it back . 	ES2009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
751.73	Oh . That could work . I like that . 	ES2009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
831.81	Are we still thinking about this screen sorry . Go ahead . 	ES2009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
851.3	'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have 	ES2009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1334.55	Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary 	ES2009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1363.45	Yeah you would think . But . 	ES2009b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
49.7	we will uh I will take notes during this meeting so 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
54.72	I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
63.19	so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
78.36	Then I will uh present you some new project requirements I received from uh the management board . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
89.03	Then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
122.04	You can start . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
369.51	Okay . Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
407.25	Maybe you can send it to me by email . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
411.75	Just to participant one . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
419.58	I will try to show it to everyone , that would be more comfortable . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
476.3	So maybe I can switch slides when you whenever you ask , that will be more convenient . So okay , functional requirements . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
609.97	Yeah but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management bo I will present them in the following . Okay . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
644.45	To find it . Yeah . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
827.3	Yeah maybe this this is important . Moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view I think or so . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
914.4	uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1298.14	Yeah I I will continue . Well ask your question if you want . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1411.66	Yeah . But also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons . So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1472.97	So but le let us see first the new requirement . So we don't have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1540.07	Well anyway I have this point . We can discuss . Also um so as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ um 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, _]
1590.48	So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1657.7	and what el what function do you see 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1666.95	Yeah . Maybe switch T_V_ on and off 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1706.78	Okay . Yeah this is cool . Maybe we can include that also . Previous previous channel button . So we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus a mute button , and uh just the the traditional on off button . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1781.21	Maybe we should have also a digit button 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1864.39	Yeah . Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental . Okay . So have a wheel for incremental , have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected , 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1884.07	And do we do we have a 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1890.25	No , a wheel is better . I would say the wheel is better . What is the expert of uh 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1947.8	And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process . 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1972.9	Okay . So um I I will uh I will so I we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email I think but you can take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent . So 	IS1001b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
107.84	And go to that one . Um as you can see it was this earlier today . Um Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . I opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kate, Steph, Sarah, Japanese]
200.05	Yeah . Good . Um , then we'll move to the three presentations . 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
728.88	Alright . And we'll turn to the next presentation . 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
935.45	And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us . 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1000.87	Yeah . Let's hear what Kate has to say . 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kate]
1531.7	It would have to sor store up the energy 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1535.16	and then use it . Solar can do that . 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Solar]
1594.2	And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1630.68	I I s usually put more money than brains . 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1764.29	Throw some light on that . 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1797.78	Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key . 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1828.99	Then you'd have to have an off te off key . 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1951.49	Come on . 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1995.37	Um you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to five minutes to finish , thank you a lot for telling me . Um right , we're ready to close . Um will be completed q questionnaire , um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together . Um your individual assignments are for 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F_N, _, F, _]
2032.84	um Kate to do the components , for 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kate]
2086.53	Um the teletext is outdated , the internet is important , it's only to be for a T_V_ and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan um which I think is more in the user uh range , with Steph . 	ES2013b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Steph]	[range]
6.79	The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . So uh 	ES2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
133.91	Uh , what do we think a 	ES2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
144.4	'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily . 	ES2005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
214.12	Uh do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the hall in terms of security stuff if we can I mean my idea is to put the photocopier and the fax in the hall . 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
315.37	rooms , yeah . And do we need a room like a reading room or Yeah . 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
382.53	Yeah . But at least deal with that particular situation and then see with the other , because I was thinking uh Gisella is quite , I mean , Gile Gisella's work is quite noisy , because it's secretary so , yeah , lot of phone call and stuff like that so Yeah , so you won't share an office with Gisella unless you are fifty per cent and not the fifty per cent Gisella is working , which is another condition . 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gisella, Gile, Gisella, Gisella, Gisella]
578.89	Yeah . Yeah , but we will have this reading room , which can be 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
766.61	One point I can say by experience , it's really hard to share an office with three people , because it makes much more noise that only being two in an office . 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
839.64	So the other solution is to say , okay we use a three person room , but only with two person each time . And leave a spare space for or 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
874.16	So for the reading room we will have a two person room . 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
941.37	Yeah . And stop reading . 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1046.92	So we can exclude this one to make an office . 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1055.51	Or maybe write on the board , I don't know . 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1183.12	So we can put Gisella in the two people room 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1235.17	No , but I think , if if the main , um how can I put that , the mm 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1248.37	If the main reason to put to to choose Gisella's place , is the proximity of the mailbox , it should be a two pe people room and not a three people room . 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1517.86	So it does mean that the three piece room which is in the opposite of the northeast is the most sunny one . 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1528.76	Let's say that . 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1644.21	Bless you . 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1747.28	So let's have a break . Save your file . 	IB4001.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
289.76	Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
388.55	Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
444.57	I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
461.78	Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice have it curved . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[k, kinetic]
499.83	Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
520.92	And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
536.32	And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one , you can see channel one . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
543.32	The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
568.71	And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
636.72	But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
645.7	Th then you'll see it on the television . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
653.79	Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
682.87	can provide our uh remote control . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
702.65	No , but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls . And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ge]
780.51	I can uh look on my uh 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
795.24	Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1124.21	The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1148.34	If uh 'Kay c If we do If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay, c]
1164.93	with the menu uh button . And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . Because uh , from h hundred uh remote controls , ninety nine have it .

1301.59	Draw it . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1571.02	Oh , you mean like that . Uh , then you can also have like uh th um 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1577.07	Yeah , and joystick , I think . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1755.63	Then I'll uh make something up . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1855.38	Just use your thumb . 	TS3010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
78.93	We'll get round to that later . My name is Chiara and I'm the Marketing Expert . 	ES2011a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Chiara, Marketing, Expert]
401.49	So I'll use the spare one . 	ES2011a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
578.64	Four million . And it well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million . 	ES2011a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
751.96	But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . But that would really make it more expensive . But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall . Something like that . And the other thing is 	ES2011a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
862.76	But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen . 	ES2011a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
945.27	Or some it i we can find out probably on the internet how much it's 	ES2011a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
245.34	Okay , uh for for uh the noise sensitive table project um we decided to um to take the noise uh as input , and uh give a feedback uh with LEDs on the table . So this is uh one of the the possibilities that were offered to us . But uh we decided to do to do uh it this way . 	IN1008.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1106.45	And after that uh if you have uh a cleaned curve and you can uh just apply uh functionally . And uh the second question was about um uh filtering and uh F_F_T_ yeah , what you can get from it . Uh 	IN1008.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F_F_T, _]
1182.34	Mm-hmm . Uh o yes , I will just add something . Um 	IN1008.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1279.41	a sound question . Sound related question . 	IN1008.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1305.44	Line in . 	IN1008.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1448.8	Yes , to to have a better sound quality . Uh perhaps it's better to have a X_ array , yeah . Something like that . 	IN1008.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2339.9	And uh from from this kind of if information you can uh let's say have uh a finger print of the user to know uh if this is the same user speaking . 	IN1008.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2439.0	This is this is a bit arbitrary . Because uh perhaps uh person two will have uh some frequencies in the range of 	IN1008.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2457.56	And if you reconstruct the stream from this uh this range , you will uh get something uh that is uh 	IN1008.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2732.48	Th there i uh let's say if you use a one second window . 	IN1008.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2882.12	Enter uh when user is 	IN1008.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3201.94	Okay , um uh I'm speaking about it because uh we wanted uh to do this table in uh a mid-tech way , let's say a cheap way . To have not uh very expensive tables . So I don't know if um uh what I've seen w on our website was uh that the this installation was uh a bit expensive . Uh but I'm trying to uh to to to see what is very important and uh what is not uh for 	IN1008.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
48.22	Come on . There we are . 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
77.7	Let's just check one more time . 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
536.17	let's make it 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
578.34	I can make a dog . 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
844.0	Well we can try to make it special . 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
934.66	like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[uniquer]
950.6	Fold open , where you can see uh more options . I think 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
977.96	No you can make an uh manual in it . 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1078.09	Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately . 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1122.26	Well I think we have to look at that , 'cause well you can do the standard way , but then you won't 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1143.25	have uh the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see . But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think , so you can do something unique with that . 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, _]
1276.93	What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control . I already wrote some down , some ideas . 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1292.85	folder about it . 	TS3004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
175.35	Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . 	ES2011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
190.16	And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . 	ES2011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[desi, circuit, board]
223.54	So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case . 	ES2011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
247.74	Uh , well we can use wood . I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . 	ES2011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPod]
1126.89	You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits . 	ES2011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1340.11	Yeah you could squish it . 	ES2011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1411.62	Well I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again . 	ES2011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1530.42	Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , calculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip . 	ES2011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
89.41	Go ahead . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
395.62	Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier . Uh let's just start with the method . It sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
410.35	So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that's pretty much covered . We can do that . What goes wrong 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
498.35	So this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others . Uh 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1233.28	Or we could use a double-sided for less used functions you 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1369.67	I'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1451.78	Yeah , but this is just a g general idea . Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1480.78	We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1508.68	press it on top . At least that's what I'm accustomed to . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1771.57	Can can we save this or 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1820.56	Could you post some other essentials of what people want , so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1828.26	You seem to have information on that , I'd like to uh 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1831.92	see some of it . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1850.82	Well , I have your PowerPoint presentation , I can get some inf information out of that . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
1856.29	Let's see . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1885.05	Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , I can draw out some ideas . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1894.98	Well , we have decided more or less the basic structure . I can put the other buttons in 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1925.23	Yes , but it should cover all the functions , so possibly , just an idea that popped in 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1945.34	Yeah , but we could go a step further , because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2104.0	Something like this . To make it kind of futuristic . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2280.14	Yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , because it's basically the most important function . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2292.25	Well , that would make them quite small . So maybe you'd put them here . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2339.99	So would we like this or would we like the 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2375.31	Let's see what we have here . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2419.25	Yes , go and finish up and I'll see you at lunch . 	TS3012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
7.05	No on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
39.62	Okay . Excellent . Right . Hopefully that's us ready to uh to go . So . Functional design meeting . We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff . Um 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
56.81	we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . Not a lot thankfully to say . We introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . Um it's come to my attention the following . Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . Um 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, Teletext, T_V]
512.6	sor if you could speed it up a bit , yeah . If you could uh speed it up a bit please , yeah . Sorry . Cool . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
795.04	Right . Um , if we could hear from our Industrial engineer , or Designer . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Industrial, Designer]	[]
810.1	If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder , or project documents . If you save it in there we can open it up from here . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1051.14	I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about um voice activated control . However I've got a couple of worries about that . The power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues . Um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice , I_B_M_ do um drag and dictate , but these require a lot of memory and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements . Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible . Um that's just my view right now , however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , it's almost like having a small 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert, Ind, Industrial, Designer]
1128.91	Well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone , something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around . That could be one possibility . Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[evr]
1214.57	I would agree with you . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1268.6	I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile . And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people . Um , if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose . But that does cover a very large section of the people out there . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1489.5	I would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is a separate unit . Um I think that it I would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now . And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1506.68	Okay . Maybe we'll hear differently , but for now 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1605.97	Um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has of course you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's a button , but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ . Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . And that could be something could um separate us a bit . And that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't power that might be something that we could look into . Yep . Yeah , it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there , so I mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, T_V]
1663.4	To go on from here . Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . Before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get , this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1678.59	Do we go for maybe a remote contro uh sorry , we're gonna go for a remote control obviously , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_ . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1702.02	We could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume , and 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1858.42	E us we might be better with the sound possibly we could maybe incorporate 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1864.85	th e the true fact , considering the cost of an L_E_D_ , we could just incorporate it anyway . The L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_E_D_s]
1877.86	So by the sounds of it , with what we're suggesting so far , your design um the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design . Because we're only going to have a very few key and you've got 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1891.64	you know a small L_C_D_ , joystick , e I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly . Um if you could look into what we've suggested so far , the feasibility of um small transmitter , um and such , maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power , or such . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[joystick]
1931.29	If , yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken , where of a joystick to control the very basic functions , and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile . I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame , but could be something we could maybe look into . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1967.0	Feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
2004.28	Um , and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say . The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally , makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control , so that's good . Uses maybe gives us a new potential market . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2079.98	In fact we might like to put a slogan on , and um possibly the two R_s to signify the company . Rather than real reaction . 	ES2003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
46.23	Do you reckon this stands for lambda or yeah , okay . 	EN2006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
792.26	And give it an acronym . G_B_H_C_ , ooh . 	EN2006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[G_B_H_C, _]
894.0	get this out of the way . 	EN2006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1154.04	Wait , fr from the linguistic side , if you if you mark star burst before and if you feel that star bursts are like objects , then I think it sh it should stay in in this case , even though it's modified by activity , or it's it's m modifying activity actually . 	EN2006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[fr, star]
1679.36	Mark the la la . Mark the whole string as one entity . One acronym . 	EN2006b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[la]
912.58	Clearly wha we we had done these . You can train after that uh an S_V_M_ , saying this is category one or two on the label document , and then we will have an unlabelled document and you just say this is directory one or two . 	IN1005.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1207.69	Yeah . You can e even keep the bag of words and do the cosine comparison or 	IN1005.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1270.38	Yeah , just know where . 	IN1005.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
451.83	Okay , you should press next . 	TS3012a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
154.61	S okay . I will make this quick , since we don't have much time . 	ES2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
266.0	Oh that's good , we can clip them on . Okay . Yeah , there was this microphone as well that you 	ES2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
906.44	specialised for game playing or interactive television . They they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things . Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , and slide another bar to say what time it ends , you know that's 	ES2003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
75.44	until here or something . And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick . 	TS3010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[joystick]
82.01	So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . 	TS3010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
87.96	And then it can break . 	TS3010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
552.19	Then make it th three . 	TS3010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
156.976	. Could you just plug it back into hers because she had oh . 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
352.15	So get this . 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
521.54	Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
756.34	Do you know about like I dunno , you seem like you know about 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
991.14	So we get to design that too . Make it fashionable . 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1030.9	Then it can live anywhere . 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1117.7	Yeah . So . Okay , let's see if I can I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know , like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1290.74	Yeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom So do you need to okay . 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1306.58	I dunno , I guess Okay so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . But then so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1337.78	Yeah . So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1346.84	Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1422.63	Yeah . Yeah . Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1472.72	Yeah . So how do you switch 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1500.88	So you'd have to have like I think you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So 	ES2011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[V_C_R]
111.37	Let me just tell us so what you know already about uh , I don't know , how far you are with the s features . Or 	IN1007.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
772.16	Yeah , just one second with without overlapping . But in frequency domain there is a overlap . Because you can choose which filters you want , more less , or just trajectories of those bands . So there is overlapping . I'm using those Gaussian filters or classical those those TRAPet trapezoidal like in uh M_F_C_C_s , right . And then processing each f yeah , P_L_P_s . Okay , tr triangulars . That one . Then I'm doing s doing uh independent processing of each frequency band . So I'm computing that Hilbert envelope , which is just the envelope of some temporal trajectory . And more or less you can divide this into a Hilbert envelope , Hilb Hilbert carrier . We use something like L_P_ , a linear prediction envelope . Auto-regressive model and excitation signal . 	IN1007.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[TRAPet, M_F_C_C_s, Hilbert, Hilbert, Hilb, Hilbert, L_P, _]
826.04	Yeah , so those are two parts or items you need somehow to encode if you want again to get original speech or reasonable quality . And yeah , there is some compression factor , which is again when you're computing that auto-regressive model from F_D_L_P_ . You can compress the spectrum somehow in in such a way that you rather um preserve those even also those dips , not only peaks in the spectrum . And it sounds better for some kind of speech signals . 	IN1007.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F_D_L_P, _]
1181.3	Right . But if you take a look for example for a s if you have a very g good music signal , which is very uh periodic you can really see something like there is one peak and 	IN1007.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1246.21	It sounds like L_P_C_ when you excited by noise . It's better , I would say . Uh better quality . Definitely better quality . It lower bit rate . But that's a problem . So so 	IN1007.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1364.63	Compression is only to really to somehow feed that uh Hilbert envelope to yeah . Yeah , yeah . You can model it better . There is no echo or something like reve reverberance in the signal if you really go down with that compression factor to like zero point one , something that . Zero point one . 	IN1007.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Hilbert]
1433.89	Yeah , you just preserve something different little bit . Let's say in R_S_S_ . 	IN1007.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_S_S, _]
1616.94	Sometimes unreadable I would say . It's quite difficult , but yeah . 	IN1007.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2047.93	Well I would like to go there , but not just for credits . Just maybe to hear something new . 	IN1007.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
386.96	Make it . 	TS3010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1001.1	So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . 	TS3010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1166.11	Now you can clearly see young users say . I will that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think . And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . 	TS3010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1216.49	Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent . 	TS3010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1284.65	And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition . 	TS3010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1311.23	You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . 	TS3010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1543.78	The the requirements you just said , maybe we should first have a discussion about that . I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news . 	TS3010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1736.74	I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection , and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . 	TS3010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1792.0	But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um 	TS3010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1807.73	And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell . 	TS3010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
731.03	Um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , um so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . Um so uh next slide , if you please . Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[joystick, _]
809.42	You must have two two modes , basic mode , where um the joystick's uh left right left right for channels , up down for volume , um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions . Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . Um , so you 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[joystick]
842.64	Yes , absolutely . Um , basi basically what I basically what the what be having um , I would say , the the whole thing articulated at two points , so that if you if you're handing it from a lef uh left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the um the L_C_ the L_C_D_ and the uh 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
906.74	I can add pretty pictures to this . The um 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
913.98	Assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position , um hol uh holding the remote , the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb . Um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users . So . 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[joystick, f]
969.8	Th this part here is the joystick . This would be the actual grip . Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well . That would be probably the bulkiest part . And you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the L_C_D_ , and this would need to be articulated as well . And basically I'd want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist . So it would fit just nicely in the hand . And again , this part could be 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[joystick, _]
1042.36	a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer just so that you could um pr program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface . And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers . Um though you i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer , uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet . Um . But uh . Yeah . 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1440.49	Yeah , actually if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , becau it's you know if you're trying to remember what uh , you know , what number's the discovery channel or whatever . It's just irritating . But if you h but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure , then you can sub-group them . 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[becau]
1500.91	Yeah , I I would say definitely , I mean I mean I mean the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation . W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip . 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1593.52	Make it harder to lose , as well . 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1647.8	Well basi basically the um for f for uh I mean e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to . It's not simply a matter of frequency . So um 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f, T_V]
1665.01	usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote , and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer and try the different codes that 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
1685.62	come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one . It's 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1692.98	Yeah , that's right . So that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1869.68	Um well I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it , um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made , I would say . Um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . So um and one of the nice things about having an L_C_D_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it . 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ge]
2085.33	Yeah . The other thing I mean it I mean it would need to ha it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway . Um f for one for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be um uh I mean although you know , it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device , the menu system ought to be um 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2203.99	I having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea , though maybe we could have options for colours as well . 	ES2003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
188.01	Uh yeah , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on . 	ES2013a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
233.77	Only animal I could thin I could draw . 	ES2013a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
242.26	Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears . Um I suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of 	ES2013a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
255.75	Um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers I think , um because they're the easiest to draw . In fact , I'll give it some more 	ES2013a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
127.83	Uh . Just one thing . Uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but I have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon , so maybe you could hurry up a bit 	IS1001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
662.68	I it will look a bulky in that case . 	IS1001a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
31.58	Come on . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
88.86	Okay , go again . Well second phase , conceptual design . It's fine , everybody knows what we're talking about . So , take you past the minutes of last meeting again . Again you get your three presentate to see what you came up with . So too bad we don't have any finance information apparently . So that's too bad . So then we'll just have to d uh have to go on , you know , the information that we have to make the make final decisions on uh on a conceptual design . So 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
176.38	Guess we'll have to do this after the after the you give your presentations . So I'll just close this one now , and let's uh let's see , . We have a lot to tell . You had a lot to go on . So uh how about you go first . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
257.72	Also if if we were choose the the L_C_D_ option , would it give enough energy Okay , that's the just assume it takes . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
314.77	Okay yeah , b you c of course you could place re re-chargeable batteries . But that's up to the consumer himself . So 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
326.75	Okay , will just take regular batteries . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
347.01	Okay , we'll get back on that later . Just 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
381.9	More than one curve , uh yeah okay . We'll just go uh 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
390.04	We'll discuss that later . Okay , we have so I think we can rule out um I'm not sure we can rule anything out . We'll do that when y when you get your design . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
442.81	Well , you have for if you if for example if you take hard plastic . If it falls it might crack . And rubber uh kind of softens the fall . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
455.66	You know what , th we're focusing very much on the covers now . I think it's just w now we're going for the basic design . If we wanna expand our options , f be fashionable , then we can get changeable covers . But I think the basic thing let's just rule out wood for now and continue . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
620.46	Which basically has the same functionality , but lacks the L_C_D_ screen . Okay . We'll pick a we'll pick from uh we'll just combine everything later . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
647.5	Once again I was would ask you if it's expensive , but apparently you don't have any data . So 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
683.69	More than sixty percent of the people would like voice recognition . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
749.47	Okay , so uh just just go for design for now . Just m have a seat for a second . Uh 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
756.66	We'll combine everything after this . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
793.93	Yeah . Or Okay , so just yeah , you can rest it on your finger . Okay . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
844.78	Well , you can work on the actual concept or actual design later with him . But 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
856.53	Well , I think what you have to keep in mind is that um you're moving the the the number keys from the top . Uh in the the simple design you have them at a top , and the uh complex design you have them at the bottom . So it would that would give us a totally different design . So which actually making a whole different product instead of two different models . I think it would be very expensive to produce two whole different products . So 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
892.64	Yeah , uh or for example , why did you pick the mm the numbers uh all the way below , and the and the channels and volume control 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
940.9	I think we're going towards the deluxe edition anyway , because that seems to be what the people want . But let's see what's what they want now . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
958.67	No , you should send it to the f to the folder first . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
964.91	Okay um , let's just assume we go to forty one . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1083.87	Let's just go 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1158.09	Or maybe just make it make it up into into a low a smooth curve instead of just less sharp twist on the outside . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1192.52	One cur you could also make the curve go through of course . But that would make make the top round . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1215.06	But let's see , titanium would give us only one curve . So but we're not d we're not using titanium . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1227.76	Just doodle something on the board on the left . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1246.21	So that let's see what you're doing . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1270.68	um decrease the the um the size the electronics that can be inside . So Okay . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1344.7	I think so because it looks leaner and we should just go with that . Anyway , you have all the time in the world to make to make the final design in a minute with him . So So we decided on what what did you guys wanna know again because this is um anyway , I'll fire up my thing . So so we come to a decision . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
1387.2	Okay , anyway . Uh energy , we choose regular regular batteries . The chip is advanced because we have the advanced features . The case , it will be the material will be rubber , suppose . Wouldn't the b the design we talked about . Uh user interface , type . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1407.48	Well I think we took all the components separately what we want . Um let's see um supplements . I'm not sure what they mean by that . Anyway , um apparently you guys , you should work together on the final design , both on internal and external design . So 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1429.33	Yeah , you should you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market , how uh what's gonna happen with the final design as we have it now . So Yeah , of course you've got your specific instruction as usual . So Wanna spend some more um I think we're in a pretty much in agreement actually , which is good . So 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Wanna]
1459.79	Yeah uh open your thing again . Let's see what if you can come up with anything new . Um I'll just do a next one . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1540.33	Let's see , I'll just make 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1547.25	And just make it red now . But it could be any colour . So 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1562.62	Personally I would prefer round ones . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1595.93	Um let's see . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1636.16	Anyway , okay . So do you want for example a 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1657.73	Okay . We'll just take the take the round button , suppose . Uh oh the square button , sorry . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1683.46	So there's our numbers . Think we need an extra button here of course for yeah , like you had for the 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1694.85	And you could include a button here for the mute , I suppose . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1721.74	We could put a logo here because it's very always in your field of vision . If you're watching it , the L_C_D_ screen , blah blah . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1732.69	Well we could we could include either here 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1747.71	No , we could put this one as favourite channel for exam 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1770.83	My uh okay , have it your way . I mean , think this looks rather like like there's something missing for example . I mean why wouldn't you include a 'cause there is a um a piece of electronics under there anyway . So why not give it a function . Let's say I mean could be anything . But th 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1840.68	Do we want something interesting with it or see . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1855.03	Will give us design problem because we have 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1901.32	Stop the curve here or continue it 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1907.72	So we have our L_C_D_ screen . Let's see . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1920.0	So you have your L_C_D_ screen right here , suppose . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1930.08	Um that would make 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1952.26	So it would give the buttons here . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1980.69	Let's 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1983.81	I think it's possible . I think it's the best place yeah , you could also put 'em here . But 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2086.46	Yeah . I mean it could be a all this stuff could be integrated into the L_C_D_ screen , which you could navigate with this , I suppose . Navigate through everything . If you have I think you sh I think the advanced options should be I think it sh the advanced option could also be integrated in the L_C_D_ screen , of course , because you don't have to have a button for everything . You can just navigate through th m your menu that you have here for advanced options with this . Think that would be fine . So that's w m would be making use of the L_C_D_ screen . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, L_C_D, L_C_D]
2122.77	Um , so the flashing of the beep , we have well anything . We could Yeah , but you could put a speaker or something on on the side for example . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2196.13	And yeah , of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2240.96	I think we should th then take it take yellow . Take what you c yellow remote control . So let's see if if we can do the LED onto it . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2351.1	You can make rubber in any colour . In any colour . So I mean you can't make yellow titanium , but you can make yellow rubber . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2362.06	Uh yeah we can make uh for example it's just something you can click on it like uh that's but it's not som not apparently that's not something we're working with in the basic design . So . 	TS3012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
76.5	Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um so actually I think 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
121.45	Yeah um f you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
250.76	Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Excel]
348.99	Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit . And if we sold a lot of squishy things . Boo yeah . 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
392.26	Okay . Do you wanna 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
579.39	Um we can do it separately and then discuss it if if that's what people wanna do . 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
592.33	Wait , one is true and so these are the questions we're answering . And one is 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
875.74	Oh I thought it was the other way round . So we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1215.94	Or I mean we could even have fruit like around I mean 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1257.58	Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that , which is a nice kind of yeah . 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1303.99	And you could like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part . 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1420.71	And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular . 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1488.17	Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of 	ES2011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
43.85	Do you know them or 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
109.33	So let's have a look , we have forty minutes , so it's it's more than enough . 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
159.02	Ah okay . And show , sorry . Okay , so let's have a look s at this one . 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
198.55	look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
229.75	So yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
386.0	Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top , then you're you're 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
518.2	People . So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control , because 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
649.13	So Paul , you can do the next one if you want . 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Paul]
697.08	So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1085.72	Yeah . Does it have to be Uh it has to be uh with different colours or 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1096.0	It's like a iMac or something . Just to make it 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1300.83	If we can still make that then 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1533.86	So we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1539.88	To flash up your 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1796.83	Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . So it should be flashy or just more interesting . I'm sorry about that . I just I just didn't read it well . 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1956.95	We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy . 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2039.26	Or you can switch it on or something . 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2086.91	Yeah , maybe you have you have to Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2101.7	O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it . 	TS3004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
125.87	Project plan . So does anyone have any uh thoughts 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
181.72	to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience . So um method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
250.41	and you'll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet this end . So we've got tool training . Try out whiteboard . Uh . So we will um . Right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works . So uh I don't know who wishes to go first . Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever . 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	True	[the, day]	[]	[white, board]
291.89	But now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera . I take it that 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
299.08	I would I would guess so . Or 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
576.41	As you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well . Anyway um . And uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . Whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
610.96	change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , so . Other than the fact that they keep dying , uh fish are uh are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they're low maintenance . Right . 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	True	[every, couple, of, months]	[]	[]
691.94	from that to give you your profit margin per unit . 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
696.93	And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time . So um 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
783.93	Use . 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
788.33	And see . Okay . Uh . 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
814.12	Oh I w um basically I'll get back to you on that . But it seems to me sensible , 'cause as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room . And uh 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
910.04	And so these are probably mutually exclusive options that uh Hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more with handling them , therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on . 	ES2014a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1086.42	Yeah , I mean if there's something that none of us like , we can just eliminate it , but we might as well leave everything 'till the end . 	IB4010.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2497.64	Although I think you can mix I would keep the format of the first one , add the quotes and the content information from the second one . 	IB4010.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2507.14	So take those take those quotes , get rid of that section of text , put those quotes in there , put the the information you had in the second poster about the movie club , how to join , kind of in the middle and keep this title and everything just slightly higher up . 	IB4010.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2559.8	Yeah , so take all of that content throw it up into the first one , and then maybe add the quotes that you had from the from the famous directors sort of at the bottom or something . Yeah . 	IB4010.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2786.82	Really eliminate Pulp Fiction . It's gone . 	IB4010.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pulp, Fiction]
2854.22	It'll make a good change from the other ones . 	IB4010.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
414.03	Excuse me . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
426.47	Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here , but it's hardly readable . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
459.56	Um , there's a energy source here . And um basically there it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . It's almost every piece of equipment um 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[circuit, board]
503.72	every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w yes . In the and it's a little more a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[li]
548.32	So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before , and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . So 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[c]
603.44	Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . I think our uh users will really uh will really like that . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[board]
632.62	No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also . So we can use them . So that's no problem . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
646.54	We can we can make its I think . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
684.31	Um have a think about it . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
828.14	Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . Well , the technical uh there I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
873.09	Yes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep . And um 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
898.84	No , so we we should use something else . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
912.48	Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , so we should think about 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
925.37	It's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
978.4	No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , so w we should use have uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1150.14	I think also . Yes . Well , we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface and 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1195.74	Okay . Well , is it maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions . Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1265.55	Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1488.2	Change . Yes , yes . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1523.05	Mm okay , but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1573.79	Okay , I can imagine when 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1577.2	I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
1635.56	Okay , so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . Okay . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1704.55	Okay . Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1749.95	There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . But maybe can we we can think something smart about it . There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . You have to do nothing for it . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1787.98	Maybe , maybe not . I'll have to find that out . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1808.49	Yes , but they're they're mass production . They're very cheap . So it will cost us p practically nothing . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1909.3	so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one the those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that these kinds of things . 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1970.19	If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . And this even uh makes it more cheapy . So 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2145.57	Because I'll have some updated info on that uh 	TS3011b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
210.36	I'll go first . 	ES2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
265.53	Right to do the um the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products . Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um I would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . Um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so 	ES2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
362.3	Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one . Um it's very easy to use . Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls . Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha from the bottom of it . 	ES2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
381.54	So , now I'd like to ask for your preferences . Um not sure of how long we've got , uh 	ES2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
529.84	Uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible . 	ES2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
548.23	There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . 	ES2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
679.34	Just just switch them . 	ES2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
773.51	Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose . 	ES2002b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
274.0	Okay hang on . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
276.52	See if it's there . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
298.34	Either refresh it , or it sh Oh wait , maybe I didn't put it there . Hang on . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
309.98	Sorry , hang on . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
388.59	um and very simple , but technologically advanced . So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
401.2	look into it , but Anyway , next . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
404.6	Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_ , and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up . What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow . And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
459.88	Um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . Um this is particularly geared towards children . Um it's very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking . Um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ab]
491.72	uh keep them away from other channels . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
493.87	So that's like another ar Um , I mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . You have the wider section for the main controls there . Uh you could see how many buttons there are . And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , because it's more for like a D_V_D_ function which we are not gonna be using . Um . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
543.04	But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we'd like the the button size on this . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
837.46	Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before , and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1116.05	I would probably lean away from that . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1275.33	Well , my little sister got for Christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring , and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work . And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off . So it became highly irritating . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[Christmas]	[]	[]
1627.68	Well , hang on . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1764.49	Um . Ha hang on Let me catch up . 	ES2010c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1009.34	Well I was gonna draw a cat too , so . I'll just try something else . Something different than Garfield . 	TS3003a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Garfield]
965.02	But look at the importance of them . The volume settings . 	ES2012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1673.3	Oh shoot . Okay . Uh just general findings . Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , uh some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver . 	ES2012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1921.83	Yeah , think that's a good idea . 	ES2012b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
118.1	The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing . If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say You know it's like it only has four columns , it's a very simple L_C_D_ like , whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast . 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
170.71	Say a button's about say a button's about this size , right , so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that . 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
259.32	Excuse me . Sure . 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
353.06	Yep , colour , sharpness . Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them . 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
373.4	Yep , left-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting . 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
433.96	Yeah advanced chip . We need an advanced chip I think , yep . Let me just confirm that . Yes I think so . 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
513.03	Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
590.86	do something on the T_V_ , the T_V_ responds and reacts as well , so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond , which I think is a technically doable thing so 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, T_V, T_V]
668.08	We just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons . 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
777.91	So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add , and you might want to add in the report , length , width , and height . 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
932.13	Maybe we should do the design evaluation first . 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1111.14	Say it's more 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1568.64	You feel like you're caged within whatever y It's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . The constraints do come in very fast . 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1596.28	I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , so time is also a very s um strong factor , and structure . Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back .

2290.32	Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful . No it is it is . It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative . 'Cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for . Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else . You might wanna write that down . It's just , I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh , and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool . 	ES2002d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Play, Doh, Play, Doh, Play, Doh, Play, Doh]
326.774	Okay , we'll we'll come to that later . Um 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
350.834	M uh yeah . M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
454.42400000000004	the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
530.034	to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
649.414	Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
682.2439999999999	Yeah . Although I think we yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
773.794	We l we can learn . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
812.9839999999999	Yeah . No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1110.704	Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1236.134	I'll give it a one . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1348.0639999999999	enter any comment you like , as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1388.194	Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1456.924	Yeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh function . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1543.944	Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1566.3239999999998	What did you think about uh 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1585.914	Try to translate that . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1770.614	Okay . I thought it was quite a handy uh thing , although I would like to see um O_C_R_ . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1793.144	To digitise them . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1871.734	Or the other way around , that you could show but m 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1973.2839999999999	No , let's find uh the way to 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1994.014	get an email . 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2016.174	redesign our uh 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2019.0539999999999	Uh I would like to 	TS3011d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
206.35	And we can start meeting . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
221.25	as you can see here . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
225.35	So first uh just to mention I will 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
232.28	take notes uh of this meeting and uh I will try to work them out and give them to you . I've also made notes of the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but then uh I had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
261.6	Then I hope you all have uh worked out some some uh some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . Um . W We will uh in a minute we will uh start with them . Um , we will see in which order we will handle them of . Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . Uh Um about the functions and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
329.64	Think that's that's important matter . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
333.09	Uh . So And then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch . Good . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
362.6	Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
437.43	Yes , mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
682.52	we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
719.12	Do you have some more important facts or 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
750.21	Mm-hmm . Decline with age , mm . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
757.78	Yes . We will talk about it later . Okay . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
820.73	Mm-hmm , y y you can move , uh . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y, y]
830.08	Yes . You can you can sa take my chair . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1210.07	I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things . Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew . I I I assume you were finished here . Uh okay . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M, Mael, Matthew]
1582.04	Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects yes . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1671.99	That's that's especially because of the internet of course . So we should think about it um . Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1732.06	Um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty , 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[the, age, of, forty]	[]	[]
1758.82	So that's to that's I mean there's a market but uh they will grow older older and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people . Um therefore , 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[al]
1781.89	make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_C, _]
1786.23	it should also be uh have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1834.63	Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ma]
1940.28	'Kay I I think now that the idea's clear . Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group . 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
2084.29	S so we can try to go in between , and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2282.69	W yes , we uh we can have lunch now . So um 	IS1000b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
21.26	Okay . Uh good afternoon . This is our third meeting already . I hope you enjoyed your lunch . I did anyway . Um let's see . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
77.08	Um but first I'll show you the agenda . Uh first the opening . Then we have three presentations . Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . How we're going to make it . And then we're closing . We have about forty minutes . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1092.41	And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1116.26	And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1142.65	Yeah , sure . Go ahead . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1258.42	And um yeah I think the um Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[signifi]
1293.49	So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1307.7	Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1417.83	Change the cases . Yeah . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1432.61	You can sell the cases . Yeah . I think that's a very good option . Because um then you can advertise as well with the Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1488.93	on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1601.88	Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1609.01	on the the board . Does somebody have ideas for a form or 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1711.51	But you have extra buttons . So people can get confused . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1742.91	Let's see if I ca 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1855.66	make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1936.23	'Kay . I suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
2034.61	So get your mouse . Yeah . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2055.63	So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here . If you can have this one , you turn it like this . And then flip it upside down . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2122.81	Here the display , and then buttons . Yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . Just that's for left hand and right hand users . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2169.54	We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . So check out the corporate website maybe . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2208.54	So just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2218.6	And then we're going to uh try to finish our project , and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think . Which are Uh let's see . I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . And then you'll get a message . 	TS3003c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
95.68	we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . Um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand . 	ES2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
170.38	Okay , right . We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal . So 	ES2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[white, board]
188.83	Okay , I'll leave space for everyone else . Um 	ES2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
373.84	Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is um 	ES2004a.B.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
590.98	I think so , I think so , I'll be able to um pull it up , or I could put it in the shared folder or something . 	ES2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
816.15	Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that . 	ES2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1025.04	I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about . Okay , so let's break it up there . 	ES2004a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Sky, Telewest]
142.74	Keep going . 	IN1014.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
727.27	Let's say that it makes uh less automatic in the sense that at point you need someone giving the file and putting the file upload in somewhere , et cetera . And it is a different kind of processing . Some way is always driven by w what you're able to do . They work a lot on layout analysis . I know they match uh uh the layout in two X_M_L_ files , et cetera . So it's a different way of approaching the problem , which means a different way of capturing different exigencies in in capturing the the documents , yeah . 	IN1014.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[X_M_L]
1819.17	Mm yeah . Now basically we have all this kind of general view about all the systems maybe we can take this opportunity to come back to our system . Because you know we had there are mm we had the long discussion and finally we decided for for one approach . And maybe take the opportunity to look just a moment uh at what point we are and w when we plan basically to get something uh done and working . I can add to that list of project is something that Jean-Marc and me we have found in the literature . There is F_X_ that is doing something very similar to to what we do here basically . 	IN1014.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Jean, Marc, F_X]
2301.68	When we can expect to see 	IN1014.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2454.31	You know , for for me what is important is when it is ready to be use . So when I can say start collecting data , uh I start using . I start playing with this . Basically the process is ready and we can start having our demo . And also because there is a risk that uh we submitted a project , maybe it will be rejected we don't know , but potentially we are going to have a student supposed to work in this . It will be no not before April two thousand six anyway . But uh you know , mm some way we we we we cannot have a students and make him wait one year before he has uh the material to work . So my point is when . 	IN1014.D.words.xml	True	[April, two, thousand, six, one, year]	[]	[]
2591.65	Uh make something re that you are using very vague expression . Result , make something . Just just uh just tell me when it is ready . And if you think it's it's not before uh but but must be reasonable I m I mean if you think it will be not before December two thousand six , say December two thousand six . So don't try to tell me March or April i w if you already know that it is unrealistic to say that . Must be realistic . you say June two thousand six we know it is June two thousand six . Uh I know . 	IN1014.D.words.xml	True	[December, two, thousand, six, December, two, thousand, six, March, April, June, two, thousand, six, June, two, thousand, six]	[]	[]
3024.97	We can try to ask . 	IN1014.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3086.98	Let me pose again the question very clearly . If I go to Herve , I can try and say we are in this situation apparently . Why don't we take one person three months , six months , four months that directly advised by Olivier and uh and we can speed up . 	IN1014.D.words.xml	True	[three, months, six, months, four, months]	[]	[Herve]
3517.62	Uh i no . Let me 	IN1014.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3578.97	So yeah . Just to go to a conclusion , because apparently yeah . So it can't work uh yeah , exactly . Can't work uh until January . So it's up to you . It's up to you to evaluate , yeah . 	IN1014.D.words.xml	True	[January]	[]	[]
3654.77	Try to have that because uh I cannot say we have tried to have 	IN1014.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
135.78	nice to stock you know , stick your finger in . Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side . 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
167.22	I'd say a single . 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
308.88	I'd say two as well . 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
322.05	Okay . I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
366.65	I'd say a two . 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
388.22	We could do it with the chip , yes . It wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype , but that's because it's only two dimensions , really . 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
603.5	Push-button . But we just have push 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
623.92	Let's call it th 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
653.83	So we can go to production . 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
701.27	Go back . 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
814.36	And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear . 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
871.64	The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids . 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Toronto]	[Macs]
921.52	That's okay . We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met . This will help them find the one . That's right . 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
934.56	And so the serpent says , use our remote . 	ES2010d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
651.28	Um yeah . Got uh many functions in one uh remote control , um but um yeah you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control . 	TS3003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
676.08	Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . So uh like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that . Um 	TS3003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
699.03	My personal uh preferences um . Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . So um 	TS3003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
742.76	It's a touchscreen . So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh . And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . 	TS3003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
794.56	Uh let's see . Uh yeah . So a touchscreen . Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah . Everybody uh have to use it so 	TS3003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
813.03	Uh ol even even old people um young people . So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . So uh Um 	TS3003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1562.51	So we can s we can skip the display , so uh we don't need it . 	TS3003b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
522.47	Yeah , you can start it you know . 	IS1000a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
528.85	No they will record through that . There's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make . 	IS1000a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
796.94	I'll tell to get it off my 	IS1000a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1028.48	You should go for the next one it seems to me . 	IS1000a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1195.54	Of course it should have a on off button . 	IS1000a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1204.59	Yeah , s and it depends what application you are using it for . You might need uh 	IS1000a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1295.62	you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then you uh Today we have uh um teletext and all those things . Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so 	IS1000a.C.words.xml	True	[Tomorrow]	[]	[]
1342.11	Let's Let's take 	IS1000a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1400.45	Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know , you you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know . 	IS1000a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
36.16	Yeah . Yeah , we'll go we've got the mailing lists out now , isn't isn't it . So it's everyone should know about it now . 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
68.64	Yeah , with the yeah , I mean I di I di I did do hard dri hard drive check um and a memory check , and it says there's no uh there's no problems , but something caused it to go wrong in the first place . So we don't know , we don't know . We'll just fingers crossed and hope ho yeah ho hope that all this is just a software thing that we can just fix like that and that'll be it . 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[dri, ho, ho]
103.76	Yeah , I mean there's there's so what we yeah , one one for one . One we'll try and get done today , yeah , get get Windows back on there . Try and get Camtasia on there and get that tested out , and then that will be I think that's everything we need f before we can before you can start running the experiments , isn't it . So 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[Camtasia]	[Windows]
177.04	Yep , yep . Uh but uh yeah . No , I have to manage to get at things working on on Monday . So that that everything went down like on the Tuesday morning . Um so my m I should get everything working on the um , yeah , on Monday , so sure that the J_C_T_ is actually working , collaborating collaborating between the two machines . Um I had dinner I wasn't actually at dinner but I d have the eye tracker stuff working , 'cause it was just me running roun running round the lab . Um still have to once it's re-installed have to actually do a proper p yeah , of proper pilot and yeah . Yeah . But um but it loo it looks like it was doing all the calibration and drift correction things that s Ellen was wanting on it . So So that don't think there's anything to add to the software for that part . Um 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[Monday, Tuesday, Monday]	[]	[J_C_T, _, Ellen]
304.97	Yeah . Yeah , so I'll try and try and get Camtasia up and running so I can try it out when when when we've got her coming in . And we'll just sort of do a run-through of proper pilot just to just just so I can see th 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Camtasia]	[]
319.56	Yep . Yep . Um yeah , I'll make sure make sure they can actually pick up the f um audio signal as well . Uh so but uh it should be the yeah , the audio signal should be coming out the speakers once it's set up properly . So that should that should make that slightly easier . 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
346.09	Yeah , yep . Uh but yeah , so they're fortunate have speakers o on the monitors inside the room . So as long as and what we'll have done is just gonna set up so the uh whatever the asterisk sound is on Windows is what gets played . So so just change sound to whatever you like , just go through the Windows control panel . 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Windows, Windows]
368.52	Yep , yeah so I'll I'll have that running over the weekend . Um so la last week I tried it with a one kilo-hertz sound . Um and it was it c it could detect it , but it wasn't but but it wasn't very clear . Did it with ten kilo-hertz and it's just really clear , where you can tell exactly where exactly where the beep is now . So yeah . So tha it's ju just a matter of um yeah , you just ba basically just play it , just play a ten kilo-hertz sound over the over the speech and then just um compare the two signals basically . Um so I've I've got a little script for doing it . So So Yeah , yeah . Yep , yep , not a problem . 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[the, weekend, last, week]	[]	[ba]
415.98	Yep , yeah , the the one the one in just installed should have that now . Um we'll double we'll double-check and re-install on software on the on the um eye tracking machines . But yeah , it should uh should be updated without any . 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
460.95	Yeah . And if it ever ever gets to be a problem in the pilot I can easily reduce the size of whatever . 'Cause that's not too hard . So 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
508.72	Uh I'll try it . 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
631.51	Yeah , yeah . So so you can you can do it in X_ fig , export them as S_V_G_ , and you just get a you just get a list of X_Y_ coordinates . Um and then I'll just write in a little script that turns those X_Y_ coordinates into a part . 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, S_V_G, _, X_Y, _, X_Y, _]
655.11	Yeah , yeah . So I'll als I'll also have a look have a look at that . But the there's there must be plenty of Windows things for th that I o output S_V_G_ . Min uh I kno I know I know 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Windows, S_V_G, Min]
749.46	Yeah . Um when will yeah but no I'll I'll create a c I'll create a convex part um just so next week um ju yeah , but it just it it just just happened to be a convex part that I was that I was I was playing with . So it it handled that fine . Um it didn't have any self-intersections , so that might be a problem . So I'll just have to have check that . But 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[next, week]	[]	[]
814.18	Yep . Yeah , so for now we'll just just assume that non-interse non-intersecting um and um yeah , and then there's this at the moment the e the S_V_G_ stuff can output ones which aren't closed polygons . But um ones ones you ones that actually had turn up into parts list uh it creates a closed polygon by linking the l end point to the start point . So so uh , yeah , so as long as long as they're yeah , so so so as long as they're they're drawn well enough , it should be alright . So um but yeah , suppose let Nijmegen uh find their find their own S_V_G_ , sort of find something that does S_V_G_ and then we'll see if there's any problems . 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[S_V_G, _, Nijmegen, S_V_G, S_V_G]
906.29	That should that should be fun . Yeah , I think it does S_V_J_ uh S_V_J_ output . Um so I'll I ca I can easy double-check if uh Nijmegen can't find anything . So 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, Nijmegen]
1028.75	Copy and paste the stuff out the off off the Wiki . So 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Wiki]
1160.92	Uh well on once uh once I've tried out the Camtasia stuff , I'll see if the if there's any problems , gonna tr gonna try and fix them . If there isn't any problems , next time I'm working on this uh G_D_F_ stuff um so so I've I've I pu uh put on a D_T_D_ and a sample X_M_L_ file on the Wiki for the G_D_F_ . So it's ba based on some stuff you put on there on the G_D_F_ specification . Um 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Camtasia]	[_, X_M_L, Wiki, G_D_F, _, G_D_F, _]
1387.86	Well uh well I kn I know on Camtasia , if you got a ca if you've got a Camtasia project , you can have the video and audio stored separately . In which case 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Camtasia, Camtasia]	[]
1396.37	Yeah . So yeah . So so we just ended the just ended the the Dutch stream , yeah , the video and our audio . And then they can easy create their audio out of mm from that outp 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1473.75	Yeah . Well one thing uh one one thing that Camtasia can do , you can have little videos when other haven't gotten got any cameras for doing that . But you could like have videos of people click on the mouses and sorta or whatever else , mm-hmm . 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Camtasia]	[sorta, mm]
1498.65	You can do yeah , you can generate call-outs and whatever . So The might yeah , I'm sure there must be a way of putting big arrows ov or whatever . Um 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1797.92	Yeah , yeah , so this yeah . Yes , yes . He'll he'll just be working with Robin on what analysis we need to get out of the G_D_F_ format . Um so I'm gonna c basically I've got a the gest analyser's the base the basis for uh um ASCII to G_D_F_ converter . Um so what I'm gonna do is actually create an output uh a G_D_F_ output part to it . Um 'cause at the moment uh only outputs the video . Um but it does have internal structures will just make it easy to do the the X_M_L_ . So so that's that's what I'm gonna look at . And then once I've done that I can look at the whatever analysis we need to get done out of the G_D_F_ . 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Robin, G_D_F, _, G_D_F, _]
2022.08	Um I think that's it . And I'll t uh yeah , I'll get get working on the Camtasia stuff this week and then so once uh once uh once we've got some some idea about what analysis you want out of this , I can think about whether G_D_F_'s got everything we need in it . Um and f yeah , what analysis we can pull out of it . 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[this, week]	[Camtasia]	[G_D_F]
2039.38	Yeah , yeah . So I'll I'll double-check the G_D_F_ specification against that just to make sure it's got everything you said that you'd you say you need from that list . Um 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[G_D_F]
2088.26	Yeah , 'cause they I mean we w we got all this in the ASCII format at the moment and it's just a matter of what data do we need to pull out of that into the G_D_F_ so I can actually do the proper analysis . Um 'cause I think all the answers are gonna be run off the G_D_F_ format 'cause 'cause we've decided that if we went and looked well if we're looking at dynamic reasons and whatever else , it has to be G_D_F_ . 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[G_D_F, _, G_D_F, _]
2128.01	Yeah , yeah . So so the G_D_F_ it's got yeah , so it's it's got uh the all th the stuff on the um E_D_F_ . So it's just the uh the ASCII file the things like the mouse movements and things like that . And then yeah , yeah , and then on top of that G_D_F_ can also it will also have information such as , right , at this point in time they were looking at the new parts area or they were looking at the target . Yeah . Um so yeah . So the the G_D_F_ is gonna have that sort of information in it . And then also 'cause it's X_M_L_ file , we can then do X_S_L_T_ or whatever on to it to get extract whatever bits of data you need for yeah , for for whichever bits of analysis you're trying to do from it . So 	EN2009b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, _, ASCII, _, G_D_F, _, X_M_L, X_S_L_T]
408.82	Or we could make oh . 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
614.87	PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow . 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoint]
684.29	Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on . Yeah . 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ruud]
711.96	So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty uh um 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1037.57	Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round . 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1083.77	think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1261.85	Yeah yeah , you can um I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute . Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . So that's the sample sensor . So if you say mute , it says mute again , and then it's um well , I believe it's uh 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1461.75	And I would think 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1614.12	No . Think so too . 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1900.77	But you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button . 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1949.94	Well , there is . Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print , with and uh 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[Just, a, week, ago]	[]	[]
2018.87	Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons . 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2044.98	What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber . 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2159.14	Y uh can you separate these uh these 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
2246.37	Use with . 	TS3011c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
239.91	Aye a fair point definitely . 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
307.62	Aye right . 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
588.13	Okay great . Um thank you for that . Uh Craig do you wanna 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Craig]
794.57	I think it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow , so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there , but keep going and we'll discuss it after . 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
916.12	Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1166.42	I'll clear one of these things for you . 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1321.37	Yeah well yeah it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but yeah you c ask away . 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1425.97	Right okay um well let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . So um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product . 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1448.82	So back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . Um I mean what does everybody think about 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1479.62	So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1593.96	Choice of material yeah . 'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch . It feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1625.86	Well I'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or no I don't think we do either . 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1703.76	So call it the snowman-shape trademark . 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2038.4	Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that . 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2222.88	Yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there um , and 	ES2002c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
196.88	Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[PowerPoints]
392.84	I can go . 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
395.72	Yeah , you should run it . 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
460.24	They like I guess use the buttons a lot . Yeah . 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
553.62	Yeah , I would assume so . I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones . 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
577.86	And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
660.39	Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
890.18	Yeah , and that's good . We should make it glow in the dark . 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1135.13	No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network . 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Disney, Channel, Cartoon, Network]
1159.54	Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person . 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1293.44	I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1504.38	Wait . 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1515.68	Or put like stripes , oh yeah , yellow lights . 	ES2010b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
166.67	I will go . That's fine . 	ES2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
296.02	I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . Boy , let me tell you . 	ES2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
591.0	the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so 	ES2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
691.16	Yeah , I'd say so , yeah . 	ES2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
722.77	Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other 	ES2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
924.35	Uh , sure . I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_ and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something . And um , you know , when I think about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table . Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S 	ES2002a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
164.09	In my opinion it is no because of the nature of the language . I mean intuitively of course you tend to use more the words that are on the slide. , But the mass of the words actually you use are words that are common . Just think that fifty percent of the words on average whatever corpus you take are stop words , articles , et cetera . So in terms of recognition fifty percent goes away . Of the rest uh remaining fifty percent I mean are all words that appear one , two , three times . So in any case even if actually and they tend to be uh related or a statistically related to a single slide , in any case in terms of uh recognition do not help at all , or help a very little . So uh that's the kind of thing uh I mean that's the kind of measure , the ind statistical independence is not on single words . Is overall , which basically means in terms of recognition that doesn't help . 	IN1016.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
253.26	Exactly . So some in some sense it intuitively it sounds very good . But in practical terms , in terms of recognition uh here we we we have to be clear . If you want to improve the recognition , that im improves very slightly . Uh it is different if you want to have other tasks where the only words that all are words . In that case , even the slight improvements uh he gets at that point , they can make the difference . But does the recognition 	IN1016.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
558.84	have to make it overall . I mean what is important is not the word that appear once , it's the word that appear 	IN1016.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1132.7	Mm-hmm hmm . Yeah , I know , this we are s s talking about today short term if you want . Uh things just to the use the things . I mean all the work they that has done basically , which is a huge work . And the data we have then uh enough for the for a thesis of course it must be much better . But of course the there's only two two different kinds of words . Some of them you can do it on a single meeting . So this kind of feature extraction because basically that's what it is , saying yes no this channel is good . Now is background . Now is foreground , et cetera . You can put it in that in that way . This you do it on a single meeting . And then there are corpus um based um how may I say it works so yeah , that is one possibility for example , finding the connection between different meetings . 	IN1016.B.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[s, corpus]
1249.21	So it can be one more feature that helps in but it is very short-term . I mean just uh well it is ju just few few few times we talk together and it was just , mean , the very quick thing you can can have uh like this . 	IN1016.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ju]
1430.91	Just with the environment is a difficult thing . I mean it requires cameras with pretty good quality , et cetera . Uh but I think his question is more uh general . A and it says so I mean based on this work , do you figure out uh a direction if they guess correctly . Uh a domain , a direction for your thesis for your exactly . Exactly . Exactly . Exactly . Exactly . 	IN1016.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1958.29	know , without thinking we want to recognize , just to have them . So the especially the audio channel is absolutely awful . 	IN1016.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2092.78	Let's say that uh in any case uh w well there are two reason . First of all we are trying to do something that can be easily the the the idea is really it's something that you take you bring somewhere else and it works . So it must be as easy as possible . But in any case I mean the device we are doing has input channels . So some way you can add as many input as we want . So we are dealing now with three . But there are other input uh lines open . 	IN1016.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2168.67	Although at that point we can use this . I mean I was mention the the lapel microphone mm just like this . But if you tell me this , that's very interesting because at this point we can use this kind of things . But I don't why why not uh so there will be other data , their test data . Uh and especially for this kind of problem I think it can be a much more useful kind of data because there is real presentations . I mean is it's reality . You know , it's it's it's uh y n it it it it's exactly . It's more realistic and um yeah , probably it can help go in this direction of saying well let's see what happen between speech and slides . Uh 	IN1016.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2430.59	Shown from this point of view it n that things mm there are other things , for example one that I really would like to do which is kind of fun . So when you have a bullet list can I click on one of the bullet and get the piece of speech where the guy was talking about that . Because sometimes people just read . Sometimes people uh im improve is more uh so for example that what that's another thing that fits in that kind of uh mm framework . And that's interesting in terms of uh I mean first of all again is measurable in terms of browsing , in terms of retrieval , in terms of indexing , annotation , meta-data extraction . That can be applied in many 	IN1016.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm]
2944.68	And so essentially say well as there is this silence time which tend to be even more than than how it is , so better to have a kind of silence detection . So something that really takes this and they recognize only that uh that part . This will improve the phoneme uh recognition rate . 	IN1016.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3325.75	Nope . But we can we can find . 	IN1016.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3332.44	Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah . But we can some way find a guy . I mean this should should be have all details , so it should be relatively easy to at least this is the last news I had and then I can try to get him back . Uh 	IN1016.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1304.13	we'll probably have to implement that . 	TS3011a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
667.41	But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y, f, ra, f]
747.62	that's so this is if you ask me personally , I would make uh 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
754.47	flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that . So in overall a simple and uh 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
807.27	It'll have to this can't be pulled . 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
813.0	You'll have to push it a bit more . 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1537.5	We could focus on the biggest market . 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1833.96	Right . I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2067.28	We could look in at that but 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2074.1	rather than like sea-shells , logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2110.55	Yeah we could look in at that . 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2154.55	Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[des]
2162.83	But we can like think of five , six designs . 	ES2004b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
77.33	I'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting . 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
86.77	My name is and uh I hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes , as will I . Um I'm the Project Manager of this project , and uh , well I will tell you on what actually is the project . This is uh the agenda for our first meeting . Um this is the opening , then we will get I will hope we will get acquainted to each other . We'll do a little tool training with these two things . We'll take a look at the project plan . 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Project, Manager]
117.23	Uh there will be time for discussion . Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product . And then we will close this session . Um but first of all we I'd like to uh introduce you to this room . Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table . Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face . Um there are cameras 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
235.11	Um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods . It consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far . Okay . But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here . I already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of uh much use to us . Uh 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
266.29	we will have to take advantage of these two things . They are smart boards . As you can see , you can give a presentation on them . And uh this one here is a white board . I will uh instruct you about that soon . Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room . 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[white]
292.69	Um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder . As you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here . Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page , um uh to go back and forward between pages , and of course uh to save it every now and then . Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
325.83	like this if everything's okay , but I first have to put it on the pen , you see I'm new to it too . Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want . As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , it's not such a fast board , it's a smart board but also a slow board . Uh but you can write things and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things , so we have uh est left . And um you can also delete an entire page , but we ask you not to do that . Just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results . Um does everyone understand this 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
378.82	But you can of course erase when you make a mistake , but don't uh delete entire pages . And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five . Um that's what you will need for our first exercise , because I'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal . 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
407.32	It's also to gets to know each other because um I'm asking three things , uh for that uh drawing , to do it on a blank sheet , with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour , and also with different pen widths which I also showed you . Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word . Well I'm not very good at drawing , but I will uh go first 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
431.42	and um try to draw 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
435.56	Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing , eh . 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
795.03	Okay , well it's time uh for some discussion . I've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about . Uh what's your experience with remote controls , um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , maybe for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments . Uh well actually I'd like to hand the word uh back to you . 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
845.67	Well maybe we should try to make it fun . 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1130.25	Okay , yeah well we have some time . Let's see what more I have to tell you . I don't think there is much left . Nope . We're starting to close . Um our next meeting uh will start well we're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes . In the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions . 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1196.46	Let's just use the acronyms . Um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach . 	TS3005a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
61.65	We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . That um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product . So that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . Uh 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, B, _]
124.12	So again um , I'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use uh um 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
149.29	a a a long lasting one . And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . And uh it it'll be uh , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life . 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
243.75	go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . Uh 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
249.41	and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kate, Kendra]
260.17	ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at . Uh so , if if we can have the the three presentations again please , and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k . 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Andrew, Kate, Kendra, k]
518.39	And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip . 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
537.99	Right , I think we need to make a a decision here . Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
604.67	Cause uh I must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . So uh um I mean I d d for slightly different well no , I mean , it's if you you 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
651.58	uh decide . 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
951.05	Mm yeah , it'll get there . Yep . 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1061.7	So three three there's three buttons on a slider . Three buttons , channel up channel up down and 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1604.77	And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look , you know , t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . Um 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1708.46	Oh no that well there's the sim my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it . 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[sorta, ho]
1927.46	So um b b Kate and Kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough , whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic . Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete , but that's a slightly inappropriate word um to something that we can we can see and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control . 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kate, Kendra, pa, Plasticine, Atlantic, Andrew]
2037.08	Um and uh we we , know , we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um . 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2075.09	that to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway , and uh and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , then uh you know , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets , I won't mention any mention any names , um it's uh it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better . 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2120.07	Yeah , yeah . And the you know , that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , 'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life , so no , I mean given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually uh uh unnecessary I think . 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2136.3	As uh as wide cer certainly wider angle than than current , so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh you know , i i it will work most of the time um . 	ES2012c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
179.32	Okay I'll just email you this file , my presentation . 	IS1000c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
396.56	Well ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . Spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart , rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment . 	IS1000c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma, necessar, sp, spongy, Spongy]
440.53	Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . That's one way of looking at it um . 	IS1000c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
452.69	Textured feel we just talked about . Maybe it's another way of doing that . So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever . Um and yeah , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so 	IS1000c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[li]
477.35	functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . They're big selling items . People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas . 	IS1000c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
597.62	Well we're selling so many units of this . This is gonna be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least . 	IS1000c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1033.0	I think you can do it both ways . You can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features . 	IS1000c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1905.48	Mm well one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys . 	IS1000c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1939.43	Um yeah I've seen that before too . Anoth another like b it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath . 	IS1000c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1963.59	Can we have can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box that's a maybe curved or something . 	IS1000c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
47.03	Hmm . Did you wanna take a look at comments . There's more uh 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
67.11	Okay , right , see ya . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
539.19	Wonder if that would be useful for some of the other stuff we're doing . Well , yeah . No . No no . Just 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
566.09	Or just return a null or a blank or a blank string or something , yeah . Yeah . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
714.3	Yeah . Actually I can up-load my stuff as well , I just have to make one change to your file . Just to load this one instead of the the default . So it's two lines of code . So 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
740.58	Yeah . Well your version , yeah , yeah . Yes . No . I did in my directory , just uh just do that , yeah . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
761.14	Right , yeah , and then update . Yep . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
773.11	'Cause yeah , like I say , two lines of code , if that . So , anyways um and then you can play . There's not much to do yet . But Have to get better results , like better presented . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
788.18	Yeah . Yeah , and just um to wire in the the topics and uh summaries . So um yeah , that's pr Well , also yeah , like that , that as well . So yeah . Yeah . just wanna find out what kind of objects those were that um for the other ones . So It goes in and highlights , 'cause that's I know . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
1064.87	Right . Well we can put the logic in a , yeah . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1135.09	Yeah . Or well the things they may n just be looking for a word or whate you know , like and if it shows up ten different meetings , then at that point they'll probably wanna like we do we want to like if it dumped by default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returned , I mean then they have to go through the 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1214.24	Um yeah , well I'm j just thinking of some way we could , you know , st cash the results and in a nice little format that'll make things a bit easier . But the thing is I mean if we've got that , then it's gonna be needing really really to load the entire corpus for that meeting , if uh if it's trying to show us where those were , if it's trying to highlight those in the text , transcript or whatever . And we're gonna have to have all that other data in there . So each time when we have a she search window and we have like , you know , ten different meetings , you know , with the word wireless comes up , go to meeting one , then it has to reload the nom object . Next one . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[st, nom]
1255.39	It always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least , like that's all I I've been doing lately is just sort of loading it up , test it , try something else and then shut down , load it up . But So um so just sorta based on that as a yeah . But uh if it doesn't take that long each time , then that should be f alright . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1308.24	Yeah , that makes sense . And that way if they know specifically which meaning it is then that'll save the time . Because I'm sure they don't wanna have the extra loading time either if they could avoid it . So yeah , or they could check mark against the ones they wanna check . So 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1329.88	Well I think they were in the text . We can probably do that ourselves and just sort of B_D_B_ , you know , just do a a string . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[B_D_B, _]
1340.88	Yeah , the long names . Yeah , yeah . Like the the working group that it's part of . Yeah . That probably even might have a . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1359.99	See if it's accurate . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1406.51	Yeah . There's a @'s trying to get uh to work on Friday . Um they did have all that and it was sorta built in and just uh had some trouble getting it running properly . Um but it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff , but it w it last I heard it wasn't working . So She was gonna look at , you know , more straight-forward sorta thing that really just fulfils what we need it to do . But if we need the if we do need the frequencies , then 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[Friday]	[]	[]
1709.45	Let's not make it more complicated . Yeah . Because the thing is the thing is that the way we were doing it we were just looking for the words , period , each word in the um in the index . Well that's way we were thinking about it . And then then it's just saying were these two words in in any of these documents , and then if it was then we go closer and do the the N_X_T_ search uh to look for the exact term or the regular expression or whatever . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[N_X_T]	[_]
1803.29	Actually it should work , yeah . Okay , then I'm just yeah . Sure that's not too bad . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1827.28	Yeah , what if it's yeah . Do the P_D_F_s , switch it to Postscript , switch it back to P_D_F_ , and then 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[P_D_F_s, Postscript, _]
1884.05	Search for stuff or start working or No . Or or browse okay , like search , browse um 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1918.06	Yeah . Browse by meeting , browse by blah , browse by speaker . Like did no , I'm just thinking of different ways we can do that , like different buttons on the top . Like if they're looking for particular person , particular working group , particular whatever , I mean we just uh we could break things down like that to that level of detail if we want . Or we could keep a more general . Yeah . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1967.86	Well , if they're part of B_D_B_ working group , they're gonna wanna look at the B_D_B_ ones and so we'd default to that . Or don't know . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[B_D_B, B_D_B, _]
2079.92	Probably or search something . Yeah . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2092.25	Yeah , like find specific meeting . You know , that's an easy sort of thing and . Mm . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2497.68	'Cause I think she's got a class at eleven . We've all got cla well three of us have class at twelve . Um could go 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2507.76	Or if we could try one . We could try shortly after . Well yea yeah well yeah . Well it wouldn't be a long meeting then . Or no . Would you wanna no , probably not . If one's bad for you , then it won't okay . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2693.21	Yeah . Well , create a new yeah . Yeah . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2726.7	Yeah . Okay . We'll have we'll have to talk to Pernilla about this then , just 'cause uh see how she's uh doing this . 'Cause if we are using that , I mean it does make sense for that , but uh yeah , and just actually yeah . Yeah . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pernilla]
2748.79	Well the thing is also I mean if it's well yeah . Yeah okay , I see what you mean . Um and then we could actually put that like on the list of um meetings that r get returned . If there were fifteen meetings with language is in , then it's gonna show you those and rank them as to which is the highest . So okay , I see that . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2779.57	Yeah . Well the thing is I mean that'll be exactly how we're doing it now , like we're just looking for the two words separately , see if they exist in the same document . If they do , then there's a possibility that they c occur together . And then we do the N_X_T_ search on that document . 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[N_X_T]	[_]
2832.24	Hmm look through them all . Well 	EN2002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
141.69	We should have these things in our area . You know , we don't have high-tech things . Well , I guess there's telescopes , but that that's that's different though , isn't it . That's not no . 	EN2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
385.67	and we can point at it . And then it is a sp a sp spectral f f 	EN2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
928.55	Well , I mean you could look at this this spectrum and spot that um th L Lyman alpha has been damped. . 	EN2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[L, Lyman]	[]
1390.06	That is true . Uh and he could point at it , that's true , and say that is 	EN2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1739.18	You have to s speed up . We'll go p could be here all day . 	EN2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2005.91	have any of it , I think . I think all of that is um just that is process . 	EN2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2171.48	Lines in the spectrum , and you'll uh estimate 	EN2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2244.45	Okay . Well , then have it in . Yeah , yeah , okay . 	EN2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3079.77	Yeah . But , have a component though as such . 	EN2006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
535.04	Yeah , you can go back up to the feature , you know . Up to 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
778.56	Yeah , a lot of time no , it I can dow obviously downloading is another thing . The only thing is that I have to do is that they have uh data in uh one particular structure , so I have to first of all , you know , organise create tar files , and then I can get it back here . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
800.21	Yeah , that I can get all those things . All th all those m yeah . Yeah , but the those files can be recovered easily , only thing is that uh now if they had to say that we cannot recover it . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
813.74	Uh uh one uh one uh day one o one , two days , like this week I can wait and see . If they cannot recover it , then I can just get all the data from ICSI and put back the C_T_S_ system . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[two, days, this, week]	[]	[ICSI, C_T_S, _]
1146.27	Mm . Mm-hmm . They are they're it's it's it looks like if you get three disk gone , then it's very difficult to get it well like fine if it's one disk it's fine because at least one is having the uh mirror mirror , so it will recache on the mirror . Um but uh if the three disk are gone it's very difficult . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1230.74	It's kind of like essentially if it is like hundred twenty , hundred hundred G_B_ data space , then it essentially will have a hun two hundred G_B_ only stu visible data f to you . But then it can we as soon as they replace one of those hard disk i it can it can from the other one it can recover everything on that . Inter internally it can do that kind of thing , but if the th if the three disks fail , then it's it's it's yeah , a really difficult job , I don't know how it can be recovered . Probably the mm one way that they extend the har the hard disk to the people who are experts , and they do like sector by sector , block by block they try to recover . But that's it's very expensive . Uh th simple , yes , the simple thing might cost you minimum ten thousand Euros , fifteen , something like that . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[fifteen]	[]	[G_B, hun, G_B, stu, mm, Euros]
1330.75	But so it tries to put if you it tries to uh quickly put things uh if this way that so that and but only thing that only one has the mm um backup , keep taking up the backup there . So it puts everything mm quickly , it can decide wherever it wants to put , so it's faster to do that way . Mm . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
1372.94	It can allow . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1375.41	Yeah , so it they have five , and you can go up to fourteen if you want to keep there . And it can still work , and it takes the and the way it look like it it's still tolerant , you know . The way it it usually it does it if you one this crashes before uh i uh um if it uh replace quickly , then no problems . Otherwise unsaved data will start the first thing is to get lo lost . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1428.27	If they can easily recover it , well 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1432.41	To do this kind of thing , you know . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1437.62	Yeah , it depends on the job . You know , sometimes the small hardware thing , they might do it to then , you know , five thousand Euros and all . But if it's very much detailed work , they will just i it the system the the whole thing starts like this that you have to give your credit card number and sign a form and then only they will start touching your hard disk . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1474.48	No no , that's what they say , like you do it , then send it the hard disk , then they will say okay , we can do it , and then if you do it with only with only yeah . Mm-hmm . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1527.55	And in fact if they they can go a lot , but you know , they can go block by block and look into it and try to recover , but um that Matthew will want to go or not is the question . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Matthew]
1893.97	Yeah , well yeah , so I j I d do I did try it yeah , th that's how you do that . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1937.41	No , but I think what I think there is still some data which is recoverable . At least they could give us time to I think that uh the most of those things should be there . I can hope it already if they could 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2063.33	Oh , that is fire will lose all the data , you know . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2141.75	For example f phonebook I can recover everything on phonebook , because I have it on the C_D_ . I wrote it once time to copy it to my home , and so I have all the data of my C_D_ . But I don't know if I had I copied all the numbers that are on that , so . 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[C_D]
2159.24	Data itself . The whole feature to everything . Features , segmentation , every label file , everything is there . I could recover it back from there actually , but 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2425.77	Anyway mm let's recover it . Ho let's hope the best . I think I think we have spent 	IN1002.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ho]
60.42	So we will get back th on that . First we have to make a functional design . After that we have to make a conceptual design , and then after that a detailed design . So we'll discuss that later . 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
77.41	First we have a look at . So first to we have to make a small painting . What have do we have to do . First you can save the documents . We have to do that every time we make something . You can print it . No . And we have to use the pen and the eraser . 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
105.04	So Now . We all have to use this one . You have to make your own favourite animal . So I'll make an example . First don't touch that things . 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
125.23	You can use the pen . And then you can make um 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
139.58	Um you can change some things . Um format , 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
152.2	change it . 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
159.55	And you can change the 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
184.33	So and after it you have to save it . Now we can make a new one . You have to paint now . So you're next . 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
546.4	Okay . Very good . So um you can always go back . So 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
558.0	That's it . So that was two . Now next . The budget . The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it . 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
926.6	Well look on your . And 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
932.58	Next instructions you'll get in your email . So 	TS3010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
994.55	Yeah , let's have Maarika transcribe that . 	EN2004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[Maarika]	[]
1719.46	Oh . Yeah , cause I this is a very frequent mistake that no native speakers make , to say circuit instead of circuit . 	EN2004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2063.66	Just to make sense of a sentence . 	EN2004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2217.43	Yeah , with some people it actually leads to some really screeching noises , because they're so loud or probably the mic is so close . I had this one um in one of the first dialogues I did , the g this guy called Ed , you could uh always see the waveform actually , you know , being just hitting um the b the boundaries on on both ends and just being at some points just black segments . And when he was talking there was this whole , like you know when you speak to close to a microphone , and that was really horrible . 	EN2004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ed]
2548.1	Yeah , I can hear the chairs moving and the 	EN2004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2899.36	Um that's it's something under signal , where you can adjust the amplitude as well , on resolution . 	EN2004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2909.43	Then you can also wait . No , I think that's not if you go to control panel . 	EN2004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2920.6	Um the vertical zoom , you can adjust that as well , so if it seems too flat for you or you can't really 	EN2004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3368.58	Excuse me . 	EN2004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
130.71	Technical pa I would think . 	IS1008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Technical, pa]
364.85	No , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice . 	IS1008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
576.32	Display in . But as far as production um I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see uh 	IS1008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
607.49	And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh the cost of the unit for the company . So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways . 	IS1008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pound]
690.04	If we can go to to my display . 	IS1008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
693.58	And we'll come back to yours just to give everybody an idea of the market . 	IS1008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
736.95	Uh functional , try functional , it might not be it either , but we'll see . 	IS1008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
766.11	So if we continue , we'll look at the findings . Next screen . 	IS1008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
821.08	So , obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . 	IS1008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
960.34	There are several that have gone through with the watches , too . You can customise a watch , you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production , you can change it uh 	IS1008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
971.23	And when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way uh it's possible to do with this , maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could you know , feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit . 	IS1008d.D.words.xml	True	[one, year]	[]	[feasibili]
1031.58	Mm that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , to see get get their 	IS1008d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
118.88	I'll do it . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
195.07	Make browsers for the rest of the night . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
236.21	j do you want remo move that just n just for nicety . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
439.03	Try that a few times . Yeah , I started I started using your um um the speak I don't know if you've seen that in the yeah . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
591.49	I mean do we do we care if , you know why not w I think , you know , it'd be it'd be difficult 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
649.97	Yeah , just do top five , both local and global , and then have another 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
685.35	Yeah , see , and that's what speaker characterisation gives you . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
760.11	Yeah . Yeah , I mean just keep it simple as 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
908.92	No . Well , I can dr 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
923.26	Well if you find anything , then send it to me . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
926.23	Otherwise I'll I'll make up some M_ . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M, _]
940.07	Yeah , yeah yeah , I I know yeah , I know how to how to put it there . But I'll have to import it somehow . I'm not quite sure . But 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1187.98	and make it up together . Yeah . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1205.89	And that would give us the whole weekend . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1255.43	Yeah . Exactly , yeah . At the end we'll say , yeah but you never gave us any test subjects . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1264.39	Well sort of , that's how I understood it . He would he would make something up . Ha yeah , find some people , that's how I understood it . Um the thing is , you know 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1318.49	Maybe , yeah . Well it will be . Yeah . It'll have to be , yeah . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1368.59	Yeah . And hen we should just have two . Yeah . Oh dear . Um 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1437.28	Well , you know , the the question is , i do we need the evaluation for the presentation . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1446.73	We should definitely ask him . Because if not , then 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1571.62	But it's still important to know . So we would def 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1627.84	But we can write a lot . I mean I think we should we should write everything . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1686.22	before half past six , I will make that file readable , writable , everything . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1699.06	Well I will I will need your snippets of code or it'd be good if I had them by tomorrow evening . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1816.79	Well you could look up 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1823.47	Mm no , that's difficult . Because it the transcription window does cross-highlighting . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
1837.44	And um when you when you g um right-click on a topic , it pops open the list of meetings that contain that pop po topic . And um and that works when you when you left-double-click on a topic oh , on a meeting , sorry , then it loads it . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1856.45	you could take that for loading . 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1962.79	Well i i i in any case , if you left-click on on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open , then it should cross-highlight . If not , it can't . So 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2006.17	Can you make 	EN2002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
39.03	Mm 'kay . L I could take notes this time , I guess . I'll takes notes this time , I guess . 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
48.28	Um actually first thing I just sorta did a really sorta brief um , yeah , version of what we have to do . Um actually I can just take that if you want . 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
149.11	Yeah . Well , just sorta well the thing is , yeah , we're gonna be touching on all that during the other part for the progress and putting screen-shots and all the rest yeah , exact yeah . Well it's something that he had mentioned in the um in the previous like just to sort of have a prototype together , and so I was just saying that , you know , we could potentially do that . I don't know . It's not something we have to 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
177.3	Yeah , sure . Like the thing is I was thinking even in the stuff that I was doing , I mean , just throw the screen-shots in there when you talk about what you're doing , right . It kinda makes sense . So yeah . Oh yes , oh actually I have a I have that at the very end screen-shots . But that didn't show up on this page . So it's not even relevant . So 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
235.13	Yeah . That's a good idea . Let's just cut out the middle man , you know . Just yeah . 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
304.1	Okay . So I'll send it off to you . Then um 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
548.33	Right . Yeah . Well I could probably just copy that straight out of the other one as well . That's essentially the same as it was . Maybe more detailed specifically . 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
601.67	I know if we'll have time to look at that before tomorrow . We could just make it up . Like I'll claim one , you'll claim the other for the search things , and then we could leave that one as a a joint one . 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[tomorrow]	[]	[]
617.81	Um I found finally today something that I can build it in and it uh I should have something for tomorrow . I should uh , you know , at least very least have uh um a GUI and uh wire I'll be wiring that in hopefully tomorrow morning . So I wanna get something I wanna see this , I wanna get it together . Have an image in my mind and I just wanna see it on the thing and then get a nice screen-shot . So 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[today, tomorrow]	[]	[GUI]
888.13	No , just just panes , just result panes for each of the three no no no , no No . No , no . So so it's just when we click , you know , topics and summaries for what we wanna search , then it'll uh 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
988.88	Thinking sometimes in a case like that , like a run across um in other languages , just that it's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally , once it's put into like a list-box or something . It's hard to tell whether it was a a transcript or whatever . And then if we're highlighting something in a transcript window , it may be difficult to get that information back once it's just in a list-box , an item in a list-box . So let's there's yeah . Whereas if it's coming from 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1134.76	Okay , maybe I should maybe I should use that as well in my Yeah , okay . 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1297.04	The thing is like well how would we display the like if we do take disfluencies out and just c you know , create a text file , take the disfluencies out of the text file and then yeah . 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1499.64	any other hints they could give us . Just to get things , I don't know , moving at a higher level I guess . 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1631.46	Yeah , act 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1698.06	Yeah . Snore . Okay . 	EN2002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
63.95	Yeah , but last time I pressed that key combination , everything went wrong , and I think I'll be able to do it just fine on the screen . So that'll probably keep me from pointing on my screen , which I usually it might just be at this point . Like there's sometimes a point to loading , not usually that long . Well , let's see . Anyway , so n uh let's just see what happens . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
83.9	In the end we did get it working before . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
237.52	Thing is a at the moment it's just really bad for me . But from Monday on I can just do twenty four seven for this one until it until it's due . But until Monday it's gonna be really bad . Like I can probably help people if they have problems with getting getting what we have running now . But 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[Monday, twenty, four, seven, Monday]	[]	[]
259.54	So I'll just start it up what we have now and then we can talk about what different people have and stuff . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
468.92	'Cause you'd reckon that you could leave them in and they would never show up in a summary anyway . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
569.82	'Kay , shall we take a quick look at the current sys 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
651.7	Yeah , especially since I've just especially s since I've just switched them around anyway . But that's okay . I by the way , I read a paper which makes an important point about combining two things of that type . Um that's basically it's it's t going on about this fancy called geometric mean , which effectively just means multiplying them . But I I have some good f information about different ways how you can sort of weight two different factors , because it's uh like it it's for something very similar . Somebody would try to solve a very similar problem where they also had two factors sort of and they want to weigh them together . And there is like a good justifiable reason um why we should do in a certain way and how we can then with a simple parameter adjust how much one weighs and how much the other weighs . So there is something for just for putting them together in a relatively simple way , but still a way that we can sort of justify . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
807.09	Yes , but also every other word in that sentence we should look at are probably in your list of fifty like list of all important words in the universe . So Yes , but it's probably just because if you look at the other one , like this is just their best sentence for like having function words in a row sort of and every o other I mean this one is sort of the developing a big infrastructure . So maybe it's just doing it randomly at the moment . I don't know . But we have some summary working and that's a good basis to start from . If I promise now that you'll get something where you can put your own data and that's sort of ringing a bit hollow . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
848.56	Yeah . Yeah , uh still it's uh it it's might be having some problem . I think this one over-ran just before . So we might still have some problem here that it's not stopping at the end , but so Dave , can you make the promise even I'm not making the promise realistically that the girls will very soon get 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Dave]
1031.86	We should probably inquire about that or like integrate tool tips that would be visible . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1069.46	Having said that , Dave , we could probably w like if we want , we could probably go back to the c um to the group directory and just use this trick . It really seems to be all about starting in the directory . But I mean if if the two of us are just working on it it doesn't make a difference 'cause I've already mounted your directory now . So And probably 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Dave]
1244.26	'Kay , it seems that at the moment a lot of the stuff that has to be done at sort of at the moment I'm saying oh Dave , can you do that . So that's not ideal . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay, Dave]
1298.97	'Cause that would be sort of the nice way to sit at home and have it forward the sound at the lowest bit rate to you . I mean seeing that it's over broad-band it's forwarding the graphics quite okay , it would probably like broad-band-wise , band-width-wise , probably work out . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1387.79	Well actually I guess if you put S_S_H_ and you know c you can give a command outright after with S_S_H_ . So if that c command is S_S_H_ again and if you that would require that you have all your key files set correctly , which I haven't , because it always fucks up on my system . Maybe if you get that working , then you should be able to directly go into another machine . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[S_S_H, c, S_S_H]
1431.06	Ok okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay , good . So to come back to the problem we had before , so the reason why the summary didn't work well in the last one and works well now is because based on the bottom data the data is so homogeneously high in its imp importance rating that it just sort of then , everything else being equal , it took the first ones more or less . But now it's working better because now it's on a much more evenly distributed 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1618.05	So You would forget that that means that you would start it fifteen times over and have fifteen zombies running . Um 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1827.09	Uh yeah , I think it would be good Dave's right . It could be good in the display to annotate them in the display if we can . Yeah , we could just make 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Dave]
1901.01	If I can skip more accurately , then 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2158.47	Uh well it depends , we we could like in some cases we could put it as a feature and say , you know , you can dynamically 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2586.67	Again , I'd say probably a good way of going about that question is to have a control which we can vary in the dis and then just sort of because that's in the end how it's gonna be evaluated . You know , in the end it this is gonna li I mean we're gonna present it and say yeah , so this our it shows disagreements . And then we see what what looks good and what looks I think probably it looks credible if like an u if every sort of every topic segment has um w yeah , or like or like something in between the three and and five agreements , but not more . Or probably maybe less but not much less and actually the I think there doesn't have to be one in everything . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[li]
2767.36	'Cause be check out what they would be like on a word basis . Maybe actually if it if there's one word which is very typical , I mean it's probably some word like uh , because that's like the only time that uh was spelled with three A_ and stuff . I think that actually that might be a problem of the whole um annotation that if they aren't exactly consistent in how they descri uh transcribe stuff like that , then we probably can't yeah . 'Cause that's when we're thinking sometimes , like why is mm high . But then probably it's the only time that mm was spelled with a dot at the end and stuff . So But yeah , like if if single w 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm]
2823.13	Well let's say at least they do it uh consistently enough that I think you can filter them out fairly well . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2851.08	Seem to be having 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2859.49	Use a random s 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3013.18	See , that probably just means that the display sort of has an internal knowledge about what level of zoom it has . So initially the display 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3110.53	Yeah . Make 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3455.29	Well let's let's see . Did it it could just be fluent on the laptop for all I know . I mean like at the moment it's not too bad apart from I think the sound is stuttering and that's b I think because of the laptop . But we can only really judge that once we have sound files . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3482.96	Well net would run on anything . But 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3503.43	Yeah , see that's 'cause that's the thing , like that would rely on I just don't think it's a good idea to run the speech tools in 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3529.54	We can he can use my laptop as sort of like as a as a server as a sound server , but that would still mean that we have to get the speech tools running on this . No , you know , I think I mean the way Java works is that t 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Java]
3796.63	Yeah , you can set the window start utterance and window end utterance . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3842.98	Well you could you could put one point one when the other ones only go up to the one . But no , it's it's not it's not a nice way , I'm just saying . 	EN2001e.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
135.13	Or or not . Um y maybe show us the general sort of outline . You keep w okay , you can just write it on the paper . Yeah . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
549.56	Well , at different bit rates . So the actual uh excitation as well . Because I mean it'd be nice uh l let's say if you had twelve hundred bits for the for the sp smooth spectrum and twelve hundred bits for the voice , and then you could scale them both . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
772.32	Yep . Or one of these glottal pulse things . F and just use basic L_P_C_ ten style . Yeah , which is which is probably , I mean , if you're going to aim for like a very low rate code to below five hundred bits per second , I guess . That's that's probably fine . But 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F]
1064.11	Yes , but I mean you can reconstruct the the f the th the entire 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1177.13	Yeah , yeah . Yeah , sure . Well , one could argue it's it's a field that's quite a sort of a niche these days , isn't it . Um 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[these, days]	[]	[]
1211.47	Well did you say uh who said 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1321.5	Yeah . Sure , sure . Push to talk and stuff like that . Yep . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1326.95	And I mean , as you say , I mean that delay is , I mean you can squash that delay to some extent , right . I n I think as far as the co you know , c c Delilah's coding goes , I don't think you can probably do much more than what's already been achieved . Because to get higher compression you have to , you know , take advantage of redundancy over longer time spans . So 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Delilah]
1394.14	Yeah , but sure . Yeah , m yeah , tr yeah it's a yeah , but I mean the th the the thing is you'd need ti it part of the parameter set for that is uh the um uh the f uh the harmonic amplitudes . And then one way of compressing the harmonic amplitudes is just storing the smooth spectrum . And then you can uh and then you can interpolate yeah , you can just pick the the um the harmonic amplitudes on that spectrum when you reconstruct on that smooth version of the spectrum when you reconstruct . Y yeah . Well , I was just saying 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
1446.96	Well it I mean you can use as many harmonics as you want . I m h uh he was just using the fundamental frequency . And if you smooth it doing a smooth spectrum representation of the harmonic amplitudes , then you only need to store the the the fundamental frequency and and the and the maximum voice frequency . And everything else can be yeah , s yeah , sure . So , and then but then the tricky the only tricky thing that we hadn't figured out was the phase information . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s]
1473.3	Um but y but uh you can still get a like you get th um basically if you do phase unwrapping and all of these other tricks , you end up with some sort of phase representation , which is some sort of monotonically decreasing function . Yeah , unwrapped , yeah . So I mean it's something that you could conceivably represent in some sort of low sort of r you know , low bit rate representation , I guess . And then maybe you'd need some sort of correction to um to correct minor phase discontinuities at some point in time . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1566.8	No , and you uh you wanna avoid hard choices on voicing decision , yeah . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1615.0	But but that that two hundred this is what they use for like um st they they do use this for um for um pitch marking in speech . So this is what Alan Black's code uses . But it's very speaker dependent wh on what sort of band width you'd look at this Hilbert envelope . Depending on the pitch , depending on the person , y you'll get a different amount of smoothing and a certain sort of so I mean , you know , if it's a female speaker for instance you yeah . So it's sorta tricky . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[st, Alan, Black, Hilbert, y]
1712.53	This carrier signal , what what it really looks l yeah . And you did say it looks like a frequency modulated cosine . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1734.12	It would have to be 'cause pitch shifts yeah . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1888.82	Yeah , it's like a yeah . And it it does start to get a little bit n non-linear towards the end . But normally that's that's when the components are not actually probably gonna be audible anyway in voiced speech , right . So yeah . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2742.41	Yeah , but it w it was for say um say you've got someone who has you know , they wanna dispute that this is what they actually said by the recognition . And the recognition network was wrong and you owe me money or whatever . Um and then they can say well we've we've reconstructed your speech from the speech recogni input to the speech recognizer . Hey voila it sounds like you uh Uh I mean obviously there's a lot more to it than that . There's a lot of sort of , well , does the quality stand up to legal sort of requirements or whatever . But um 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[wanna]
2827.04	Yeah . So I mean maybe try to see how good you can go without transmitting any of that information . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2865.33	So I mean if you wanted to transmit with fewer bands , you'd maybe still keep the lower bands or or maybe you could still transmit the pitch . The pitch isn't that big a deal . But it'd be nice if you didn't because then I mean that's well , I mean it's worth giving it a go and then men maybe seeing wh what information you can add to the data stream to improve performance . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2891.01	That that'd be cool . So get coding . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2965.26	Ah , well I mean Huffman's easy enough . But but yeah , sure . Uh that that's where I stop . Run length encoding , I'm out of here . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Huffman]
3012.01	I mean I I th I think they do try to I mean obviously the the the techniques they they choose are supposed to be less , you know , susceptible to coding errors , let's say . You know , i but I mean that's maybe the the limit to that . 	IN1013.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
89.7	Okay . Yeah . Right . Well um I thought the right thing to do was to review what Wei-Xun's been doing in the area of dialogue structure for work package one over the last period . So basically for him to talk about what he what progress he's been making and then for us to um for hi for him to describe what work he intends over the next period of the project , and for us to figure out what help he needs with that . Um m maybe give him some help figuring out what publications he's gonna um get out of this and for us to make sure that it fits into the overall project . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[the, last, period, the, next, period]	[]	[Wei, Xun]
564.99	Oh okay , well we we can discount back-channels . I mean uh c are you is it okay if we talk about this for a minute 'cause I'm confused . Or or do you get a c 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
687.74	Well do y 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1567.58	So um but those kinds of measures um , you know , we could use to um to do this kind of segmentation if it's important to the analysis , right . W but we need clearer definitions of what the different things are , how many different kinds of of um activities are there . You know , is it just interactive and non-interactive , or is there are there there more grades of shading than that . And um , you know , what are the things that you expect in each . What's the back-channelling behaviour . What's the speaker turn , um you know , what kind of dialogue acts do you expect . I think that would help you pin down what the definitions are . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1943.73	Um the well are you thinking it's been a while since I've read this literature . But I mean my understanding of exchange is is that the initiating move introduces a goal to the discourse , and then the remaining moves um will uh contribute to either the um the meeting of that discourse goal or the decision not to bother with that discourse goal , right . And so um I'd be surprised if there wasn't work describing 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2269.56	Yeah . But but a reading of this , you know , th could tell you that there is no case where you're gonna be looking for initiation and responses that's gonna work , you know . 'Cause you could go through and see that um actually the pattern of of addressing different discourse goals is too dispersed to um to be able to do that kind of mark-up . But I g yeah , I mean i obviously you wanna have a front-runner scheme i in mind before you 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3297.49	I It just helps you know which theory you should be concentrating on . So you know , that immediately discounts exchange um structures that are mostly for information seeking alone because the notion exchange is to restrict it there , and in favour of um these these more argumentative things . So I mean uh I do think you should keep in mind what the final goal is so that you can plug this into something at the end and and um show some benefit of having the mark-up . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3582.8	That was the that we the browser task . You know they've identified these seven different tasks people might wanna do with browsers , um you know , like uh join a meeting late and ch um catch up on what's happened in the meeting so far , be at home waiting for the washing repair guy . And 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3791.68	Can actually try . Mm-hmm . Yeah . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3879.56	And they've been declared hub . So so they'll accrue all of the normal an annotations . Of course yeah , you'll you'll never get the T_N_O_ and D_F_K_I_ stuff on it 'cause they're only billing stuff for the one to make the 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_F_K_I]
3902.32	Yeah , just figure out how we're gonna help him to to try to make this more efficient . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3959.7	Yeah , but we should make sure we finish that off , because otherwise that work's just wasted , right . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4077.21	The AMI data is is there . There's I mean there's hub set A_ is transcribed I think um in final form . You we can check the Wikis . But you know , the data is rolling in . So 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[AMI, _, Wikis]
4109.34	And but Barbara still says somebody's done this for chunks . I'll have to look up , you know , so 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Barbara]
4207.59	For Switchboard , yeah . But then he there were two possible options for uh for doing this on the AMI data . You could either um essentially go the same route as they did with the Switchboard um , you know , do the Penn tree-bank and then create the chunks off that , or you could chunk directly . And it wasn't clear to us which one of those two methods was the right way to do this . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Switchboard, AMI, Switchboard, Penn]
4235.24	Right , well , so you'd have to produce as part of this exercise . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4364.58	Huh . The names would suggest that this was the idea , right . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4503.99	So ask 'em , right . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4584.23	Okay . So just ask D_F_K_I_ how much data and when , right . If 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_F_K_I]
4696.09	But that's a pretty tight time scale then , right , 'cause it'd be for the fall we'd wanna know the evaluation . Is that the time scale you're thinking of or 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4724.39	Mm-hmm . I think you should still ask Barbara again , you know , c can you have another think about who might have the chunking stuff . 'Cause she has said several times there must be somebody and she can help with that . And um I think she's just forgotten . So 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Barbara]
4739.83	So and then we can evaluate on the ICSI , you know , pretty easily . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ICSI]
4803.93	But that wou that would help us be a lot more specific ab than than just um you know , listing bullet points on slides cause then we'd know sort of which literature you're thinking of um putting in and we could read the most important argumentative stuff . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ab]
4818.04	I can have these things anyway , yeah . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
4923.66	Yeah . So you can do this exercise and then come and talk to me some time next week . I'm not in Monday , but the other days I'll be around . Mm-hmm . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[next, week, Monday, the, other, days]	[]	[]
5108.25	That'll be the Exactly , yeah . So you wanna go through basically the user requirements and , you know , maybe think about some user requirements of your own and make a case for , you know , these are the kinds of things that we'd want , and look , you're gonna need um this kind of dialogue or argument structure for it . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
5132.46	Um uh uh I'll think about that . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
5212.14	Yep . So then try front-runner scheme on , well , a front-runner theory . 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
5241.51	So we'll get together in about three weeks . Uh 	EN2005a.B.words.xml	True	[about, three, weeks]	[]	[]
356.25	Uh so this is our what uh we have made . This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build . Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive um and it's it's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a uh uh a looks-wise it is beautiful . Uh and also compact in shape . Uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . 	IS1009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
620.31	Tell , yeah . 	IS1009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1656.82	yeah , include some more buttons and uh um yeah features . We can make the buttons few buttons smaller . Uh I think they are quite big , so I think I I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . If we want to have more features than that . 	IS1009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
19.21	Okay . Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing . Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager . And I know all your names again , Courtney , Fenella and Amber . Alright . Okay , so first let's go through this PowerPoint . 	ES2010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mandy, Project, Manager, Courtney, Fenella, Amber, PowerPoint]
84.53	And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um We're gonna have discuss the functional design first , how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah blah blah . And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . Same thing with conceptual design . Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . That's pretty much the the whole process for today . And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . Okay . Alright . First we're gonna start off by using our tools . And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here . 	ES2010a.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[T_V]
139.79	Alright , let's go forward then . Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . Even if you are not a good drawer like me . Alright . 	ES2010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
164.98	Bless you . 	ES2010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
190.14	Oh do I . 	ES2010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
347.08	Okay . And I'm last . 'Kay . Look at my sad sad giraffe . No , no , no , it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , but whatever . I don't know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look . They're just such odd creatures , you know . I I like that they're so unique and individual , I guess . I don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . Only seen a couple in zoos . Yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look . Okay . Alright . Guess we're getting straight back into business here . Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote . 	ES2010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[States]	[Kay, zoos, Euro, Euro, Europe, Asia, Euro]
508.27	Right . So that people like my mother can use it . 	ES2010a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
754.76	Have to come back to that later . Okay . 	IS1009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1371.09	We'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost . Okay . 	IS1009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1381.16	Okay . Go right to my first my next slide . 	IS1009c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1386.41	Um alright , my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . I s I spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it . And I would encourage you all to do the same . Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . Um people like something that really fits in their hand . Simple is beautiful . They don't want to have to squint at small print um , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible , and they don't care for the mode thing . They want each button to do something . And eye-catching is important . It's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing . Go ahead , I'm trying to finish fast for you . Um and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item . And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . If we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product . And I've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular . And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item . 	IS1009c.D.words.xml	True	[Christmas, this, year]	[]	[wanna, li]
549.97	Right . But if you compare no , if you compare it with some baseline , let's say you use just G_M_M_ with diagonal covariance matrices 	IN1012.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[G_M_M, _]
2550.97	It and you can train it , like only your speech or it's general uh it's quite interesting , yeah . 	IN1012.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2643.46	How to say okay . 	IN1012.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2936.25	Yeah . Well let's 	IN1012.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2045.36	concatenate all those , shouldn't be too bad . 	EN2001d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3231.47	So you at the moment you have got a threshold and everything that's above it is displayed . Or how do you d 	EN2001d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
188.05	Uh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . We can go into that later . Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well . 	ES2015c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
217.65	Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . A bit out of date . Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed . 	ES2015c.B.words.xml	True	[fifty, years, ago]	[]	[]
330.6	Um , we also can choose what materials um , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . Wood . Um , again , stepping back in time again there . I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . But , would've been maybe for future projects . 	ES2015c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
406.02	Yeah . That's true . And that would lead to an advanced yeah . If we have yeah . We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip . And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget . Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . It's the most straightforward . But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . . Got decisions to make there . And this is what I was just saying before . Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . Um simple would go with the pushbutton . 	ES2015c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
481.14	Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . Um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L_C_D_ , 'cause we probably can't afford that one . 	ES2015c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
572.41	Yeah . Or like an you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just it's protective as well . It , it stops it , I mean , it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily . I think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe . Yeah . 	ES2015c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[iPods]
1119.01	I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something . 	ES2015c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1435.68	I think we possibly could take a more abstract design . Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . Or a strawberry seed or a leaf . Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . Instead of fruits and vegetables , just if you look at it straightforward , it's a bit yeah . It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme . But may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know . But initially , I dunno . I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit . 	ES2015c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1649.36	be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and well hope that it works . I think yeah . I think no . I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . Go for it . 	ES2015c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1736.13	I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber . 	ES2015c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1995.77	Yeah , that's it . We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . Yeah uh I brilliant . 	ES2015c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2096.37	We can have a look at those ideas , yeah . 	ES2015c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
0.02	Uh I guess I start with my presentation . We had two groups of people working on this . So we'll show you two slightly different presentations . Feel free to ask any questions or comments , obviously . Um the first one was done by myself , Bruno , Marianne and Nikos . And the rationale that we have , I'll show you the layout in a second , was that full professors would get private offices . Administration is close to the professors offices , so it's easier for the secretary to speak to everyone . The fax is in the administration office , since it's mostly used by Gisella , who's the secretary . For noise reduction purposes we've moved everyone who has office hours together , and we've also put the network printer and the photocopier in the hall . Um , so I'll just show you how that works . Basically , you can see Gisella sort of there in the middle with the fax machine , and Maggie and Susan , who are the two full professors in our department have the private offices . And the photocopier and the printer are sort of in the hall on the side there across from mailboxes . 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bruno, Marianne, Nikos, Gisella, Gisella, Maggie, Susan]
59.72	Um , just to go back , most people are grouped in projects . And we have two fifty per cent people who are half time in Geneva , half time at the E_P_F_L_ in Lausanne . And they m them we've put in three person offices , so that in the three person offices it's not constantly three people . So there's a little bit of give there . And the reading room , or the lounge as some people call it , that we have is in a central position . So basically we've got Andre and Nancy at the top . Um they don't actu they will be starting a new project together , if um if I'm not mistaken . Like I said , Susan and Maggie in the individual offices . Nikos and Yalina , who work on the same project , at the bottom . The reading room is in the middle . Um , Marianne and Bruno are at the bottom . Um , as well , Marianne works closely with Pierrette and the other Marianne . We have two Mariannes in our department . And David is a half time . So as I said , the half times are in the three person offices . And on the other side we have Maria , Martin and myself , who all work on the same project . And Martin is fifty per cent . Um Gisella , we've given her two person office for two reasons , one is because there's a spare place there , so if we want to put a stagieur or someone who just comes in for short period of time , we figured it was okay if they were in the admin office which is a little bit noisy , because they're only there for a short period of time . Um , and again the proximity to the other offices . Um so I guess that's pretty much it for our proposal . Um I don't know if you want Andre to go through his first or if you have any questions for me .

450.87	Well , do you want to do your presentation and 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
762.95	Oh , in a way , if that's your argumentation , then put a visiting person with a senior 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1040.87	I mean , suppose if the need really arises and it comes to a point where we do have a lot of people , then you can get rid of the lounge , figure out what to do with the furniture , either distribute it between various offices or put it into storage somewhere . 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1072.06	no have some quiet time and That's where it came from . 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1100.12	Yeah yeah , and people can come w in with their stuff or leave a newspaper or a magazine lying around for other people . We've got a bulletin board where you can paste up articles that you think are b interesting for other people , but 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1380.88	Okay well , since this one's up , keep this one in . 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1386.92	Easily , go ahead . 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1520.58	So we can say that this is sort of for But then again you get the more formal visitor in with a bunch of students in a crowded room . 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1534.39	Well , you can say that this one is for let's say stagieurs or interns . 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1569.03	Well you can move Maggie and Bruno 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Maggie, Bruno]
1573.44	into this room . Move Gisella , move the other spare place to the big room , but then there's not a lot of people in there . 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1764.22	Actu Bruno did mention that he didn't want to be in a room with a lot of people , 'cause he did that before and he didn't really like it . 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Actu, Bruno]
1958.89	Mm sure , yeah , we can do that . 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1978.09	Okay . So I'll save that . Yeah . 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1997.94	The final copy . I'll circulate it to everyone , along with the numbers that you guys wanted to see in terms of the space . 	IB4005.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]

196.85	Hope it working . 	TS3008a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
615.45	I will try . Yeah . I will try . Uh 	TS3008a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1143.33	Uh , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market . It's international , so we have to use a standard . 	TS3008a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[yo]
1195.54	Use friendly . 	TS3008a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
346.38	Yeah but Yeah but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control because the 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
371.35	And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
488.04	Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . If you have the language , you have to develop for each country . 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
561.16	To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe . 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
579.06	So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s, channel, T_V]
755.59	Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
970.42	I can say it to you without . 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1019.0	So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . And 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1060.64	the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1200.68	integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1583.62	Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1670.68	And pf what can we think a supplement to 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1702.42	To push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . Yeah , turning yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands , so . 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1767.46	expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1803.43	Need it to be , okay . 	IS1003c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
23.16	If you look closely , you can see . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
194.73	Yeah , some more menu options . Yeah . Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . But um Now let's look . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
303.12	You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . You just drop the Okay and the Back . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
363.54	Okay . Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we need a lot of Yeah . We need a lot of extra buttons . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
394.69	Yeah if you lose the the Back , the Okay button Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Okay, Menu]
436.17	That would save zero point two Euros compared to No . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
445.34	Yeah . To This together is more expensive than Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this . And we can drop these two . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
687.97	No y you would rec 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
696.92	Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . For the volume . You can use those Yeah . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
735.09	Yeah , okay . It would save enough Yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left . So we can maybe still use power button . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro]
769.31	Shit . Drop the special colour . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1151.39	Uh y we should fill this in now . Yeah okay . Uh 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1157.76	Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three . But now , in original design I say two . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1241.38	Uh check with the Excel sheet . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Excel]
1249.15	Yeah integrate it . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1254.94	Just go scrolling and it will activate . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1328.72	To get into menu . Yeah . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1333.16	Or hold it ten seconds . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1453.82	Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Excel]
1932.01	So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1957.31	Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1989.5	Yeah I'm I'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2203.91	Can you just push pen and then keep on 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2275.4	Yeah . You can just reuse that , because the name is the same . Initials . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2355.49	Okay . And copy this . Just a minute . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2617.73	And you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or oh no , they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate . You can just if you ma finish my presentation please . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ma]
2631.46	The presentation is still open . So if you finish that then you'll see uh 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2640.83	Oh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation . Just uh do that quickly . Uh 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2804.96	Use the pen . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2896.68	Oh . Uh we should uh enter our questionnaire . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2943.26	Hope so . 	TS3006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
357.3	energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called six , or something like that . Uh and then 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
386.34	then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
422.29	So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel . And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gabriel]
459.95	Um , should I erase this or 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
549.17	Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
603.07	Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
609.12	We can see at a later stage , maybe , I don't 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1596.76	It could come 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1604.24	But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and 	ES2007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[R_R, _]
508.76	Suppose you have to go to the T_V_ and do it manually . Mm . 	ES2003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, Mm]
969.84	Oh , and joystick , yeah . 	ES2003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1361.82	Think it's ten minutes left . 	ES2003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1532.74	Put a leopard print on it . 	ES2003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1550.42	Yeah we gotta . I'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that , that's that'd stand out . 	ES2003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1677.85	Yeah , I'll go with five . 	ES2003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1812.54	Well , it depends who your who's what the target people are , like you'd say 	ES2003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1824.58	women would be going , oh look at that , 's cool , it looks like a it's 	ES2003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2112.2	We'll still settle for twenty five . 	ES2003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
527.16	But we can take a risk . 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
814.3	Let's um see um 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
824.11	Let's 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
839.54	Okay , let's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design . Um I have some uh a method , a requirements and scale of . I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not . 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
870.97	uh make a new blank sheet . 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
906.43	Oh wait . Uh pen . The p 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
915.23	Look and feel is everybo it's true . 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1048.41	But wha w oh , yeah . What are we uh 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1129.1	So everybody's agree with an uh three on it , it's 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1292.53	So we can say it's it's the product is it's okay . 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1385.95	Yeah , you can make 'em another one . 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2109.82	I will write that one 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2178.12	Yeah , okay , I will ask you when uh I need the information . So it's oh . 	TS3012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
64.32	Check check check check . 	TS3004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
469.84	Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has . Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . 	TS3004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
532.27	Okay . Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then . 	TS3004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Paul]
549.09	Oh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can 	TS3004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
563.31	Yeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be . 	TS3004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1343.04	Okay yeah , you can you can change Yeah . No . 	TS3004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1883.48	Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have 	TS3004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mm]
1906.38	And um uh uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic . Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project . 	TS3004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1965.4	Yeah , but that's a round one . Maybe we can choose then . 	TS3004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2296.59	If you set the pen yeah , he will draw here . 	TS3004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2309.39	Yeah , I'll see it . 	TS3004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
69.08	Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . Right . Um . So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it right . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
274.15	And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
296.84	Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[U_I_D]	[_, I_D]
326.3	um to try t of sync it all up . So that's the detailed design . So it's a three stage kind of thing . Um right so for now just for th the white board um 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[white, board]
346.13	um and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um . Oh , we skipped introductions . Nice . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[five, C_D_s]	[]	[]
419.26	Well I'll t i no no yeah I'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down . See I'm a big music fan I don't know if you guys are , I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent but 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
474.23	Okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises I think . It's kinda weird . Anyway yeah . Yeah , you're like press and it's . Kinda cool . You'll see . Alright so um whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Kinda]	[]
594.57	Ah yes yes yes okay I see that . Vomit . Yes . Street pizza . It's so brilliant . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
748.97	Especially when we're all from the same general region . Right so okay , success on the whiteboard . You can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s and things we like about the city you know , I think we'll 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
782.33	forty bucks for a remote . It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . Um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
804.97	Um so something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s but um you know I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_V_D_s]
825.92	Um s right so um just to close up , I'm not sure how much time I've used mm next time right Project Manager , sorted . Um . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Project, Manager]
843.89	Um U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_, s]
902.22	You mean to like 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
922.05	Well , have a think about it . I mean I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able isn't it . I mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function . The clapper . No I mean no , good idea , good idea . We'll see what see what 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
949.78	Yeah . That's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to um 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
986.39	All right we'll find them , we're on our own . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
991.38	Yeah yeah let's do it , let's do . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1136.87	Let's see . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1167.43	Uh let's see . Um . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1272.71	Yeah . We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pound, Dollar, Euro]
1288.82	Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that's black and you know m massive , some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1300.0	But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it and um 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1352.57	They serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[America]	[Pounds]
1362.15	Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1386.18	And uh right so thanks for that . Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into . 	ES2009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
47.79	Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes . 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Tod]
53.13	Uh so we will see our three presentations . 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
58.75	Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Manager, Expert, wi]
92.7	Should stay in the square here . 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
119.92	Oh , you can put it here . Oh that's okay , it's jus 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
547.99	Click on yes . 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
901.96	Okay . So , maybe you can talk about the function , and 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
947.06	It should work , so you can . 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1394.13	The third the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . So um uh we should we should keep uh The the product should be recognisable . Uh , uh 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1426.6	So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Real, Reaction]
1553.49	Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1577.7	Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1587.37	And inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch . If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . I It just an idea . I don't know what you think about that but . 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1786.25	We should hide them somewhere . In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that . 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1818.67	It's it's a kind of setting , I think . It should fit in those settings functions . Because it's not a very current useful function . 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2027.86	W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler it's is better . 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2097.9	So maybe we think we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time next time . And uh yeah , now the meeting room is busy . Somebody booked the meeting room just for at one P_M_ , and so we should leave . 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[P_M, _]
2116.83	So , um . So now we are going for for a small lunch . It's uh funded by the company . And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works . And uh I will do the minutes . And uh 	IS1005b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
382.46	So it will have five point five average . 	IS1001d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
493.89	Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . Yeah . 	IS1001d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
520.14	So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely , or 	IS1001d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
437.52	Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . Also with on off switch and infrared uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kate]
513.32	Uh material yeah , that's what I have to say about material . Can I scroll down on there and see what else 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
623.46	it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[kiddie, toy]
738.39	I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , but we do definitely think that it's a viable option . 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
971.6	I'd call these quite uh minimalist , 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
976.12	simple and plain , but I mean I do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , so in that respect it is quite fancy . 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
988.13	I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , I'd say maybe aesthetic . 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1023.2	Well d we'll just call it fancy then . 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1234.4	I would say maybe a two , 'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1292.37	As for see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1492.12	What does double curved mean , I don't understand . 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1499.94	Single-curved , I'd say . 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1711.49	Yeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . So much better just to go and , 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1841.51	to keep a simple old technology , which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , so . 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1852.04	Yeah . So we do count as I think excellent or one . 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1870.12	Bring on the ice sculptures . 	ES2013d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
325.31	So they do need to be in the 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
511.96	Do we have uh yeah . 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
615.04	And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech alright . 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
720.79	Ah look . 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
772.1	That w . Let me check . 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
834.19	Uh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and I was supposed to do it like this . But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself . And then make the the design , a the actual design , but I never came around to do that . So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it . 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
866.27	I mean everything speaks for itself I guess . Mean you press a button um the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . And uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . And then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_ and the T_V_ will translate it into a function . Um 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[certin, T_V, T_V]
1013.68	Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean . The uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote . And yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever . 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1343.78	Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display . 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1545.68	Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things . 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1693.43	Help . 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1775.03	to use 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2160.52	Yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu . 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2181.59	sorry , uh is uh if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you're not already at your choice . 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2266.83	Bring it on . 	TS3006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
405.63	Excuse me . 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
494.1	Uh no just escape 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
594.89	Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
856.39	Yeah . Well I mean we could make a Yeah . Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[k]
1107.83	Yeah . And that would k also give it kinda durability and 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[k]
1278.61	does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1350.04	Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1381.35	Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . They've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1450.42	I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's Yeah . 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1547.25	Yeah . Make them make them think of fruit , yeah . 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1552.6	I mean uh some uh I l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple . 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1659.06	You can standardise those , I mean . 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1714.85	And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1783.95	Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1867.42	It does leave them with an obligation to Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . Then if it's just sitting on the 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2077.49	Yeah , can you save that uh send that last one again , please , Raj , as I still can't find it on the 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Raj]
2216.88	See . 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2261.68	Um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , it's a 	ES2005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1146.5	Well , yeah , we'll skip that for now . No I d um the lounge okay , but I think we need to also see it as a overflow place when we have um uh visitors for any length of time , so they actually have a place to work . 	IB4003.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1258.82	No , because they can share their ideas across the project , yeah , I would say . 	IB4003.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1356.84	No , n it's in in principle it's a it's a no smoking building . You can smoke outside . So you can go outside onto the balcony to smoke . Not even in the cafeteria . No . 	IB4003.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1422.47	No , we we do have one constraint that's difficult , which is uh Gisella , because when she's there she's very noisy . 	IB4003.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1638.32	So we we invite invite and then we say , okay you can sit with Gisella . 	IB4003.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gisella]
1854.52	Okay , I'll ask um uh Maggie and Pierrette uh if they have uh any preferences . 	IB4003.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Maggie, Pierrette]
1926.65	Wait . 	IB4003.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1931.7	Wait , wait . Tuesday um 	IB4003.C.words.xml	True	[Tuesday]	[]	[]
84.83	You may have to do the function F_ eight thing . Oh , okay . 	ES2015a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[F, _]
470.91	We have moose too . 	ES2015a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
298.9	You can manage all this , yeah . 	IS1003a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
405.29	Yeah , I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer . 	IS1003a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer, wi, Industrial, Designer]
484.61	Yeah , maybe should go and draw an animal . 	IS1003a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
567.36	Just go , you you the closest to the whiteboard . 	IS1003a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
234.05	Um I'd like to um hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . I want what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Catherine]
261.55	It's just that yeah , let's let's hear from you first . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
279.97	Get yourself in position . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
453.98	when a T_V_ programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . Yeah , I like that idea . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
559.42	I'll have a Big Mac , please . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Big, Mac]
599.81	Let's have rubber push buttons , hey . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
728.29	you know . So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
741.62	S yeah , push buttons . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
844.39	Basic battery . It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
917.75	You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . It's not actually what you are doing . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
949.64	And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
958.35	Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gabriel]
1284.55	Let's move over to 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1498.95	That would mean we'd have to make a television as well . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1584.29	And and this is all tying in very nicely . The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1787.44	L keep it clean , keep it clean . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1926.98	So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1987.01	Okay . Alright . Well um , we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2010.95	Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design . Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . You won't be going off to your separate offices . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Gabriel]
2031.26	I think , yeah , it's gonna you know , come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . 'Cause at the moment , uh you know , it's it's hard . We were kinda going , yeah , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start , 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ki, ab]
2219.6	hold hold fire . Um . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2252.15	I want a share in the space rocket . Did you see that this k that this company we've made a spaceship . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2332.96	Okay . Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting . 	ES2007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
35.67	So b maybe I'll go back to your questions . Um 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
70.16	That is quite different , you you need to use a signal you have separated and uh do the type of analysis I mentioned . Um from the spectrum you can transform the the magnitude spectrum and um um build model of the person . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
266.48	What w w what is m what is more expensive is to um take the decision finally . So your decision can be for example uh who is it , or if the person moved , which is probably the most complicated thing , like the person goes away , then comes back ten minutes later , sits at a different place . Uh you will need to build statistical models of um the person identity using these measures . So the ones um he mentioned um 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
381.6	Yeah , so that might be good for example for ten minutes , but then the person might move , or a different person might come . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
456.54	But that you can do with location , if it's only on the short term . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
466.1	On on the off-line yeah . I would say you might use these measures in a simple way if you do it uh on-line . Like um to give feedback . But uh you you mentioned that another side of your project is also to analyse off-line . So there you might want to use a 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
488.28	We had a student here , he finished uh one or two years ago , but he left his software , and his software is precisely to do that to um cluster at uh another level , to cluster these small clusters of speech , uh group them by person automatically . Y no , from the these measures , pitch , etcetera . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[two, years, ago]	[]	[Y]
525.67	Yeah , exactly . So I would say from location at the lower level you can get small parts of speech , and then at the next level , possibly off-line , you can uh group them into um a speech segment . I'm hoping to have enough time to try um doing that before I finish my thesis . Um so if I manage to do some um uh practically usable software , I'll tell you . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
575.72	More busy I would say . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
581.73	So you said you want to do separation , um but ex exactly , yeah . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
615.35	You might want . Okay . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
661.33	No no , you should separate them first , yeah , yeah . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
670.1	So the type of things I presented can lead to separation . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
688.46	Although it might be , if you want to um ex extract these features like pitch and uh rate of speech , or energy simply , from each person . Um you might have to do some ba basic separation . 'Cause quite often people uh don't realise that they talk at the same time , um interrupt each other . So even if you don't want to recognise a speech fully , at least um you need yeah . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ba]
731.28	It's okay . You can email later . Yeah . Um 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
788.78	Yeah , you could detect one word , yeah . Keyword spotting , yeah . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Keyword]
809.67	Yeah . Yeah , I I'll just say uh if you want I can point to um three papers , um but no , I think it's better if I just send you the link , it's probably simpler . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
855.46	It no , you can do that . There's no problem , but i if you want your your system to work in different conditions , like cafeteria , library , um the environment will be quite different , so a single fixed threshold value might be a problem . S 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
882.01	So you can do that automatically , this kind of things . Um I don't know if you're doing that already , but uh 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
921.04	And the last one I would say is um the clustering um to um yeah , the clustering of the different locations over time , so that you can get small clusters of speech . Um there are other ways to do it , but uh I think it's it's important because um in spontaneous speech all these words are quite small . So you need to do that uh adequately , yeah . But otherwise yeah , I'm done . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1068.42	So I I'll send you links some of the papers are long , but you can just um briefly look , yeah . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1080.26	Um we can go and see Olivier , unless you want to talk about something else . 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1094.37	Well , we can try . But uh 	IN1009.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
90.1	Okay , so my name is Petre . You can call me Petre , or Peter if you like . I don't care . 	IS1005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Petre, Petre, Peter]
342.63	Okay , American , um . Um . I would use the bird . 	IS1005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
546.0	Just try . I would like to see how it looks like . 	IS1005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
604.39	Bob . Have to remember it . 	IS1005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bob]
797.35	Yeah , but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume . 	IS1005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
833.36	Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if you have some more notes on that . 	IS1005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
971.33	Sign . 	IS1005a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
108.42	Well let's close this one . We'll just uh open a new one . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
137.15	And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
281.08	Okay . Well , we'll we'll have to skip that part then . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
335.99	Well , we'll see . We'll see later on . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
377.35	Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
512.04	Well , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
862.03	that's what they're trying to say . Uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . But , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
926.31	make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . Okay , something else nice to know . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
953.44	I think it's something about the Oh , okay . I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
963.71	Okay well , let's go back to the 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
975.95	That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . Well , if I can uh make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . I think we're we're looking for some Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . Y well , that 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
1026.95	Yeah , yeah . M yeah , that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other , because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger Well , ma 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[M, s, ma]
1058.34	But I think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1065.21	Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player . You can uh , know , you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . We don't want that . I think that was that became clear . We don't want . But w maybe we should put some func uh , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to , 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, _]
1242.87	Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . And simple . Well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . So we should put uh zap buttons on it . Um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ju, zap]
1347.9	Well yeah uh , lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using I think we should just put one teletext button on it . Then we meet uh the new requirements . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1415.35	Yeah , and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1582.49	So maybe uh that's i I think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it's very important to find something like this . So there's a very important task for you . And maybe we can all think about it . Uh , also for you maybe , when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well , you know . So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[al]
1648.28	And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . I I think you m might wanna put it uh yeah , that it it it it stands up . Yeah , you have to put it on its So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table . no no , put stuff inside it . But , it's like like a statue or something 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[shou]
1667.49	Yeah yeah , but yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1696.9	Yeah , but but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1739.52	Yeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and So , it's not gonna be that expen 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Taiwan]	[ma]
1760.94	Well , I well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . That's one . And uh you can always find your remote control up 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1774.39	Uh , okay . Well , maybe yeah , you could when that's when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , but you will you do need uh also an uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . Does it makes it kinda 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1814.1	I think it's a good idea . And make it , you know , we we um 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1868.92	Yeah . Oh , if it let's well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . If that's too expensive , we won't do that . But it would be nice . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1912.07	So , easy functions . Well , we will we will I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2013.2	Oh okay , I'll make sure I'll I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it won't work , but you'll see . I think these are more important than the first ones , so 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2038.21	Oh , five minutes . Yeah , because uh I I d I did uh the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy , you know . Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could uh , know , use for the other ones well , but uh I d think uh I forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something . And then you you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . Becau I d uh , it was not my uh pen . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Becau, I]
2164.44	Put it in there uh wire on it . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2218.81	Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Exactly . When you you see it from the side , then it would look just like that . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2232.21	Well , uh I think it's nice , for one thing . maybe put something on top of it or , you know , like that's looks funny . I don't know . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2246.75	We'll have to think about it . I think we're we're done . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2251.22	We can save this one . 	TS3008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
67.33	Alright . Um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
83.95	gave it . And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . And um evaluate the product , as a group . And um 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
249.19	Yeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
441.2	Think like vanilla and banana would . 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
742.86	Yeah . I would say two . Personally . 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
790.08	Yeah . I'd say maybe three . 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
891.03	Ah it'd fall over all the time though . It'd be annoying . 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
898.83	'Kay we're done designing . Come on . 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
993.94	Yeah . I would give it a two still though . 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1140.55	Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter . 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1150.73	And then like twelve , enter . 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1181.25	Your thumb might get a little bit uh 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1306.24	I would say so . 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1368.45	I would say two . 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1428.1	Go Heather Pauls . 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Heather, Pauls]
1453.15	um in our shared folder , if everyone could go there right now , um 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1501.41	It's locked for editing . Read only . I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . I have the original in my um 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1531.23	Okay here we go . So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . So um if you can look up at the screen , um the large screen , oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros . 	ES2015d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
68.24	let's go for our detailed design meeting . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
72.92	So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , and our Industrial Designer , Baba . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Baba]	[User, Interface, Designer, David, Jordan, Industrial, Designer]
94.27	So we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control , and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
108.87	And in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . So maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their You have s oh , sorry . Oops . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[fabrica]
186.51	Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but keep on speaking . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
267.36	Everything's mushroom . So we can call our remote control the mushroom . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
471.63	Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
576.08	Three , I will say three . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
960.43	Fine to coarse . And from ten to ten channels here . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1007.85	Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . Nobody would take it . So nobody w will lost lose it . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
1029.59	S maybe we can change from th 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1102.91	evaluation . So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1213.04	Okay , just keep on going , just to have an idea . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1390.46	And push button . So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1517.96	I think , yeah . But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1537.84	Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1698.81	Oh , that's interesting . You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1757.2	It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1850.47	Maybe what you can do a test . Put it outside , and if bees come , it's really fruit . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1894.23	So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
1943.09	Try to . Okay uh 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1992.91	I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2038.58	Okay , I will close this . Mm . 	IS1003d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm]
1.68	Okay . So now that we've all had a bit of time to think about it , um does anyone have any concrete proposals or do we want to just 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
62.4	Yeah , give them like the most comfortable offices and 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
97.51	Okay , so let's 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
99.69	go through that first . Um 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
217.65	'Cause they'll fight for the window . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
224.18	If she's in there half the time , she can have her desk near the window , and okay , she's not near the mailbox , but 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
376.64	Okay . Well 'kay so let's put David in there , yeah . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[David]
383.78	You'll meet him . Okay . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
392.31	make a list on here of who we have . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
399.55	keep talking . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
516.6	Would have to be here or the other three person room . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
523.73	Pick a room . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
589.16	Yeah . That could work . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
694.71	But then we should split the little party up . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
733.26	See I would put it the other way . I would put the room with Martin in it in the two window room , 'cause he's fifty per cent , so then at least 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Martin]
745.25	Put Martin in the three person room with two windows . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Martin]
885.27	me and Martha . I can see that working a bit better . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Martha]
1013.48	switch no . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1028.22	No . Well , most of us first of all have desktop computers . pick up your desktop and plus you can't assume that you can just use the reading room for reception hours . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1091.02	Mm-hmm . So what if we put you with yeah . Will you have . Okay , so 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1216.71	Do you get the photocopying noise . Now we are all gonna come photocopy just to annoy you . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1243.98	I should start start making full sentences . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1274.34	Pierrette should have a smaller office , 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pierrette]
1419.92	Okay , let me just write down the arguments for why um 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1613.1	No , they'll have to go down . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1677.32	As far as I know , yeah . As far as I know basically we pack up one day , the movers come , take all our stuff , put into the red boxes . So when you get there the next day , all your stuff is already in your office . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[one, day, the, next, day]	[]	[]
1694.55	So , we'll see . Make sure you label your boxes properly . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1715.52	Uh we can try . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1717.84	I can ask them . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1839.56	That's it then . save this . 	IB4002.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
511.09	I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay . 	ES2005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
554.26	Okay and then how do I press the the big one , to get it on to the big 	ES2005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
701.97	hang on . 	ES2005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1137.95	That might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries . 	ES2005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1401.67	Although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap . 	ES2005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1518.09	Glow in the dark material I was thinking . Um , so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think . 	ES2005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1620.61	Well what about this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or something um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . If you find if y 	ES2005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
1710.71	That could also be built into the T_V_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete . 	ES2005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1835.19	'Cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control . 	ES2005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
108.24	Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions . 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
116.33	Think that's better . 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
199.88	Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . Um then the elements . 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
632.54	We can put those here . 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
690.88	Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
707.26	through view . Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . So you can switch back from second to w first . 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
741.78	Yeah mm nee uh No , if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on . 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1422.75	think that's a two or a one . 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1449.42	Yeah , you could make a a front 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1519.18	But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo . 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1764.45	Yeah . And make notes . 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1899.81	Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . But you might as well do it in normal computer style . 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[kinda]
2186.9	Yeah . Now we can look at this . 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2669.48	Fill in the questionnaire . 	TS3004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
217.4	Draw . Alright . 	TS3006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
295.68	Okay , then m make a new one . 	TS3006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
501.61	How to select the next or here . 	TS3006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1048.18	Okay . Better make it 	TS3006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1092.76	Yeah well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video . And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch , one single switch 	TS3006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[li, Windows]
1196.87	Alright let's move on . 	TS3006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1208.0	Yeah see you later . 	TS3006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
413.52	Spongy . And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . This is really interesting change from past years , because it is much more organic , um some would say approachable . And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[past, years]	[Paris, Milan]	[]
453.16	handset . So . I also did a little research on um 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
542.32	Exactly . I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . They could be ini initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . Um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it . They could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . So what we're talking about is changing . 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
625.48	Y yeah , but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
712.29	Is spongiest , yeah . That would add 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
740.0	call it something that's fruit and veg 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
744.55	oriented . We could call it uh 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
777.4	And then we could keep it titanium . 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1228.25	Alright , well let's see then . 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1719.46	To uh m make it . 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1803.01	Do you think with um 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1819.21	And have it abstract . You know , we could call like a fruit name , but it would be a little more abstract . 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2030.95	It could tie in with the fanciful design as uh , you know , throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving . 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2056.5	Mm-hmm . But I could market that as a um as a a I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know . 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2208.24	Then I'll just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that . 	ES2013c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
754.77	So , are things we are we have uh speak about before . Yeah . And um so you you can go 	IS1001c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
835.39	An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that . You ca uh you can go uh before , before , yes . And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is uh technological innovative , and after the easy to use . 	IS1001c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
73.42	So , I will open our functional design meeting . 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
78.84	So , I will play role of the secretary . 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
83.71	As also Program Ma Manager . So , we will have the three presentations from the 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Program, Ma, Manager]
99.32	And after that we uh will have the 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
112.89	close the meetings after . 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
356.37	Go on , go back and 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
370.14	So , you will propose us something which is 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
778.94	So I will let you to do your presentation , so . 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
991.08	And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1133.81	If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more . 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1139.59	Yeah , it will cost little bit more . 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1233.58	new information about the product requirements , so you will have to 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1238.6	take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1269.47	So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , and also the remote control will only be used for television , so 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1301.66	to do remote control 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1320.67	So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product . 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1352.12	So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1381.2	Require lot of requirements , but 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1473.4	Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised . 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1491.23	Yeah . It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . Think it's a re reaction remote control , so . And also it has to be attractive , of course , because if you want to sale to sell the remote control . 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1543.14	I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break . 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1549.78	And you will have in thirty minutes individual work . 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1560.88	You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept . 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[industr, Industrial, Designer, User, Interface, Designer]
1579.28	work my subject . And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . 	IS1003b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
552.64	Do you think 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
588.67	User Interface Designer . Uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . There're two functional design options . A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[User, Interface, Designer]
685.31	Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . And less functions would have to be included . 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
792.19	And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . We'll have more money to go into the design side of it . 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1091.14	And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up . 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1099.76	Very basic internet , yeah . But you have Yeah . But you have no interaction back with it , you know . Like the internet you can send emails and You've no interaction . 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1454.68	And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out and , yeah . 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	True	[fifteen, to, twenty, five, year, olds]	[]	[Euros]
1829.41	C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something . 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1911.6	I would go for 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2139.36	I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised . 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2212.79	Yeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . Y Could buy extra 	ES2015b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
664.2	Yes , so here you can see that the the the men is I mean , they are always sh sharing the room with a g with a woman . I mean , there's Bruno , me , uh Pierrette and Nikos is a guy also . 	IB4004.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Bruno, Pierrette, Nikos]
688.6	Mm-hmm . So I mean , this is perfectly fine , I will just send Martin and Andrei for Maria or or Yalina or Nancy , maybe . 	IB4004.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Yalina]	[Martin, Andrei, Maria, Nancy]
1265.49	Let's put m Maria or Yalina in the in the in this place . 	IB4004.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Yalina]	[m, Maria]
69.71	copy . 	ES2005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
200.21	Uh can I have 	ES2005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
551.17	Uh you can do one thing . You just select one box outsi yeah , this box . Then move it with the help of this Okay . Just uh just uh Okay , just a minute . 	ES2005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
877.74	So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . How we are going to means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not . How mu What rating we will give to these products . So of course this is will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . 	ES2005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1125.29	So what do you think you will personally give . Seven . Uh . 	ES2005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1315.3	Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . 	ES2005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1329.48	No sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing . Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , and that's I have taken it very wrongly . Yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly . So we can say one or two . because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two . Yeah . So where were the trends . 	ES2005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1583.81	Yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . So four six six 	ES2005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1610.8	half . So we can say two or one Okay . So th seven seven . 	ES2005d.B.words.xml	True	[seven, seven]	[]	[]
1627.2	Uh overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two . 	ES2005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1633.18	Yeah . So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . So we can launch it . Yeah . 	ES2005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
320.73	'Kay , my favourite animal , uh let's see . 	ES2007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
384.48	There go . 	ES2007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
660.79	Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would 	ES2007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
669.64	roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . 	ES2007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
899.43	Yeah , we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate 	ES2007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, T_V]
961.3	Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um 	ES2007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
1007.52	Yeah , rathe rather than focus on 	ES2007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1167.89	Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . 	ES2007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
633.33	Or combine uh both with a with one uh 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
664.26	And throw it . 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
766.95	yeah obvious . Um yeah . Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control . 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
777.27	And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options . 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, _]
840.53	I wanted to to categorise everything . Uh with a speech display uh yeah , sound , everything you you noted in your uh minutes . Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light . So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous so that's an a also an option . 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1100.07	Yeah . Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with LEDs uh beneath the the buttons . If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1218.33	Yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . If you have uh it have it in your hand , you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1499.16	We we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse , with which you can change uh and so if you 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1608.03	Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . If you we uh yeah . If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , also for the for the more uh yeah for the people . 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1932.61	Okay . Yeah I I was think about a red uh red LEDs and blue LEDs and 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2083.72	Yeah l let's just uh delete all these uh or 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2125.38	And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface . 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2246.42	Yeah the display , we yeah we can put a display . 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2287.54	You can make it m larger . Maybe it's easier to to draw uh 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2379.48	But why why do we need uh the flipping uh 	TS3006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
146.5	Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . So now we we have the okay , so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um 	ES2006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Ma, Maarika, L_C_D, _]
311.11	Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . 	ES2006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
357.2	You can have a look . 	ES2006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
387.59	Yeah , see the budget . 	ES2006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
580.87	But we can we can I can I can take note uh uh 	ES2006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
679.22	Yeah yeah yeah , I mean yeah . So you guys can decide wh whether 	ES2006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
699.34	Uh this this kind of uh makes it more and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel . 	ES2006d.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[I_R, _]
948.1	basic premise of a remote control . Um the basic function is to send messages to another system . Okay so much is clear . An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . Often in the form of infrared bits . This is the most mostly used . Um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is 	ES2016b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1316.68	go . 	ES2016b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1984.65	Talk about maybe f look at that from the side , there maybe . Which is technically the easiest option . Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So . 	ES2016b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2004.63	if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . 	ES2016b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2012.88	Right . Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . Just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on . 	ES2016b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2037.73	I know . You know what I'm getting at here , fel look at it from the side . It's like that . Right . Uh 	ES2016b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[fel]
2068.18	Right . You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . 	ES2016b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2301.4	Make it a piece of furniture . yes . Yes , there you go . 	ES2016b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
170.08	Maybe a Spanish name would work well . Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there . 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[U_S, _]
224.0	Yeah that's . And we could have some like you d you could have the fonts you know special , so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O_ as like 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
566.87	Well it can still be a , you can still extend past the hand . 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
597.52	Some finger grips maybe . You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything , but 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
734.76	You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so . 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
781.92	Okay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe be easier to could I use the mouse , or 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
855.88	Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times . 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1055.43	Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control . Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1075.51	I I would if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way . They don't really do anything . Maybe you know I although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good . Um but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device . Um 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1129.87	Well I guess that depends on how you market it . If you if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy . 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1184.62	And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but I think one maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology , and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks . Say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room . 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1853.92	'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide . 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1888.85	You can get a lot more information on it . 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1902.29	So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to . 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1908.88	You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading 	IS1004b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
56.98	Uh , hello again . Uh it's uh the same as the last time . Uh uh , also this time there will be uh three presentations . And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts . Um uh , and at the end , uh I uh , when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh visited . information . 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
641.73	I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too . 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
645.61	Yeah . Combine them . 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
791.69	Yeah . Do your thing , Tim . 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Tim]
797.03	Bring it on . 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
983.48	Would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1046.36	Maybe you could use your remote as a phone . 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1676.58	Yeah , maybe it can work with show view . Uh , you you can control your video recorder with show view . Uh , when you tick in a number , it will uh start and end uh recording . But maybe there's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out . 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1773.36	If we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise . 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2302.89	Yeah yeah y yeah yeah . Okay , but uh think about that kind of things . That's what they said in the master class . . N Uh , next meeting starts in thirty minutes . So uh maybe you can go to Paris and Milan uh once again . 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[Paris, Milan]	[]
2368.18	So you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh But I think it was a very uh very good uh session , uh gentlemen . 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2379.65	I will thank you all . 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2384.93	Give me a good evaluation . 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2392.33	Cheers . See you in a half hour . 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2397.83	But keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh 	TS3007c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
132.92	Right , so , I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal . I have no drawing skills whatsoever . But uh let's see , introduce myself . My name is Alima Bucciantini . Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US . I'm doing nationalism studies , 	ES2008a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[Maine, US]	[Alima, Bucciantini]
155.82	Oh , and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . So let's see if I can get um here . I will draw a little turtle for you all . Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that I think they're drawable . 	ES2008a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
197.54	Um . I I like the whole having a shell thing . It's quite cool carry your home around where you go , um quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , um and they're easy to draw . 	ES2008a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
240.19	No , you can erase the turtle , it's alright . 	ES2008a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
706.24	Yeah . Could we get something that 	ES2008a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
751.98	Yeah , and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . 	ES2008a.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
290.9	and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . 	ES2004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
796.5	It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , i it's not gonna add anything , okay . 	ES2004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1152.1	It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . 	ES2004c.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
218.53	Could have one for your stereo , one for your D_V_ player . 	ES2012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
310.0	Uh yeah , just click there . 	ES2012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
609.17	And then at the end just take an average 	ES2012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
731.73	Yeah , uh that's a good call , yeah . Well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that . 	ES2012d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
600.63	Check . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
754.52	use a lot of but batteries . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
758.13	The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
781.62	senden okay . So uh if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
798.77	or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, L_C_D, L_C_D, _]
1092.36	Because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much , two years . You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel . With the L_C_D_ screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint , and then you can use it again . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[two, years]	[]	[]
1195.48	Yeah , if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings , so the other buttons are gone . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1317.17	Yeah , okay , I'll I'll post it . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1331.73	Yeah , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1339.13	Tha i l i it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
1500.44	Yeah . And then b that uh before an hour when its get again gets empty . Then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in a recharger . Charger . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Charger]
1595.22	Just a small device . Plug it in , that's it . Yeah , like a like telephone charger or something . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1921.59	D Mainly if you turn the uh remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume . And if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it . It should be available but not 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1951.02	They'd have to be easy to use . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1975.52	Uh play , pause , doesn't n need to be there . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1984.17	We could check the other remote controls with technical functions . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2097.12	Would spend more money if it looks fancy . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2122.87	Yeah , see through version . Yeah . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2262.7	Yeah , you tap . Touch screen , yeah then it's turn turn off , turn on . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2327.54	Yeah , but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2354.28	Yeah , if we can afford it . Yeah . 	TS3005b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
274.34	Or browse . 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
316.5	Also so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back . 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
367.94	It's a very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market , actually that's what it that it i and would cost us to build it about eight Euros . 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
512.77	Yeah . I really can change it , so 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
521.0	The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that , and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here , or in the button th here , so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . And here is a small L_E_D_ which is like blinking one , which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier okay . And uh well then we have a cover basically , basically you don't need much of the time this , when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[tomorrow]	[]	[]
670.2	Well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1048.8	Well I will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say you know . It though the look is fine but uh still I will give four in that case you know . 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1248.37	Yeah . And you might have a slight thing for to forward and 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1293.75	Say about that . 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1389.96	It's a two , I would say two . 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1499.57	Oh no , this would I I would I would give this model to the old people actually . Yeah . 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1567.72	And people can still decide to use the cheaper one 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1661.67	We have to practically test it . The field test will tell you how good . 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1948.0	Yeah , it migh It it'll need uh more than a conventional one , it won't be uh just maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually . 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[A_A, _]
2278.91	That'll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times . 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2353.54	Or we could even replace them by buttons actually . 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2488.66	That will create another problem . For the people to use it . 	IS1000d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
111.62	Um , so let's try the whiteboard . Um so any of you who want to go . 	IS1006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
270.47	Yeah . Next . Let's talk about money . 	IS1006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
650.05	may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah . 	IS1006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ye]
757.33	uh the ones , make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . 	IS1006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
778.65	So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes . 	IS1006a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
27.06	Think s 	IS1002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
111.87	My name is Inigo Montoya . You killed my father . Prepare to die . 	IS1002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Inigo, Montoya]
565.64	That kinda would r d yeah . That would kind of lose it . 	IS1002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[kinda]	[]
647.92	Um so the the what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without with a l a less complicated um design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access . Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial . 	IS1002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1038.21	I dunno . I'll bet first in volume maybe . I dunno . 	IS1002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1936.69	Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator . 	IS1002c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1486.31	Yeah , we can take it from there . Yeah , I agree uh , we can take it from there . 	TS3007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1493.14	Or edit . 	TS3007a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
573.88	Yeah , that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away . 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
894.63	I'll just just check what it said . 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
981.0	where it was connected to the remote control functions . And uh it was quite uh a swish model , where it can control uh four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , video , D_V_D_ , audio . Um so that's a bit of competition there . So 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_V_D]
1036.88	There was children's remote , where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1208.69	Yeah . Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design . Um just to avoid ambiguity . So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a V_ on for volume , 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1227.06	Um let's think how they did this . 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1243.64	Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , and that's the first thing that they see 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1262.72	yeah , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down , whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up . 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1512.37	I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use . 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1531.52	Maybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . Maybe that could be a little apple . 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1628.74	And that you can make them curved or double-curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look . 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1653.99	And that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber . 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1756.61	Yeah and then you could have Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that . 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1991.97	the remotes that I've got . See how uh 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1995.62	Let's just get that bigger . 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2106.39	Yeah . Yeah and and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it . 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2215.46	Uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple . 	ES2014c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
68.42	Yep . I'll do that next time . Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
81.73	The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent at the last minute , I'm sorry about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we've got forty minutes to do that in . 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
556.1	increase the price . 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
579.94	Yeah , I think that will do . Okay , so do you want to 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
669.96	Should yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting . 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
901.73	Yeah . If I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1046.6	Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one . Do you want to yeah . 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1607.73	Here , let me 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1801.67	Yeah , but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check . Um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1816.63	and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising . 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1918.53	So that you can yell at it , yeah . 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1987.28	That's but then if you're buying the remote separately , but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
2051.88	What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . It should be on your desktop , so on the yeah . So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them . 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
2092.58	Yeah , and email them round . 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2099.97	Oh yeah , put them in there . Yeah , then you don't have to email them . 	ES2006b.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
164.28	Oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and uh 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
223.47	Yeah . And you could also touch it so that it comes out , and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
260.7	Yeah . Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
271.86	Uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen . Uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . We put ano an an extra button in . We can erase it , but It's the button where you can switch channels . just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . Yeah , that one , yeah . It has a name . And uh uh we put that in , I thought it would be handy there . Uh this the one number or two numbers button . Below that , the page and the sound . And uh in the middle the the mute . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D, ano]
320.76	Or at least it should look like it . And the options uh of teletext . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
357.72	I will put it back on the on the nice green . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
479.93	Y you should make uh a sideways uh view . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
488.0	Oh g I would smart board . Uh can I draw here or uh 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
587.64	I would make it a two or something . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
660.48	So you can use the b the the arrows . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
719.69	I would say yeah . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
724.09	Yeah , you can make it a two . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
747.75	You you can touch options . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
756.65	You can touch options and it's comes out . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
851.2	I would make it two . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
920.69	Well but then when you scratch it it does come off . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
950.6	Yeah . You can break it . Yeah . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
956.54	Y yeah , you could you could call it . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Y]
966.72	Yeah , y you can lose it , but it isn't hard to lose . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
982.14	So it's a two . Yeah , you can lose it , so I don't you can make it a three I 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
987.84	It does have an a built in function . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1057.43	Two two two . Let's make everything a two . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1081.47	You could call to your uh yeah , and the screen , yeah . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1198.03	And you can navigate easier , because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal T_V_ uh remote . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
1213.7	Yeah . Let's make a different remote . Well 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1321.05	Do you have the cost or uh 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1325.29	Let's hope . We're going to be here at eight o'clock . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1367.24	But you should uh direct 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1479.98	We could lose the curve . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1483.54	Yeah , I would lose the curve . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1590.52	We could make it titanium instead of rubber . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1624.78	See , a po three . We need point three . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1634.54	Make it uh 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1658.79	Yeah , you can , you should you have to lose 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1727.74	Yeah , so you always lose the special colour . You co you could make it always black , like normal remote . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1738.05	Oh right , yeah . Yeah , we should u Yeah . We have to make this like four or five or something . That's what it means . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1803.66	Perhaps you can then copy page or so . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1829.71	By the Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something . Add it copy page . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1865.64	Yeah . Oh ignore that . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1896.73	So we could fix it like tha that it's like this . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1901.39	You could select it all , but then you can't erase . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1930.14	Just tap somewhere . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2103.56	Yeah , but then you can work together too when 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2127.78	It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2160.28	Yeah , you can point to where you want the line to be . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2210.57	Yeah , I used it to y to Yeah , it did work pretty well . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2225.88	Yeah , and then you can show it to everybody . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2368.62	Yea uh so tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that . Yeah . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2384.17	Think that's about it . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2577.56	You can only save it in my documents . 	TS3005d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
50.13	Good to see you all again . Let's see if that comes up . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
75.79	Let's start . Okay , our agenda today um just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
111.91	First of all the functional design objectives . Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
130.83	Okay , three presentations , um you can go in any order you choose um . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
138.15	Sure , please do . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
247.84	Press the little presentation . It's the um it looks like a Y_ kind of over there above Draw . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Draw]
1008.42	You just press yeah , just click . That'll be fine . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1091.75	Um yeah use that thing you can go back , previous . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1107.22	Double click on it . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1419.42	Yeah , or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow . Like , we can we can play around with it a little bit . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1561.67	To produce it , yes . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1650.25	Kind of pull out of the side . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1833.14	I'd say we're uh can we narrow it down to maybe um 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1893.05	So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because , yeah , things so different will appeal to different people , but 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[d]
1945.78	Okay , we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions . So let's do that quickly . Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2044.57	Yeah , I would imagine . Just 'cause it is an electronic device , the 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2117.38	Um you each have individual actions , I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept , User Interface , the user interface concept , market trend wa watching . And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you . And hopefully , I hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[I_D, _, Industrial, Design, User, Interface]
2225.26	Okay . Well I'll figure that out in the meantime . 	ES2008b.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
88.67	I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . Um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
103.95	And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . Um 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
112.7	I'll go through the mee through the minutes first . Um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . Um and 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[mee]
188.05	And that it should look different than what's out there . 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
280.06	And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . Um from energy source , um uh what we would use . Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . Um 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Industrial, Designer]
300.65	How that would power the remote and the lamp . If we were to to have one . Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . Um 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
349.91	Okay and I will leave that , leave it at that . So 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
603.27	feel to it . You can 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
619.97	We could leave that to the cover department . 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1792.16	I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1829.75	It's sort of couple of couple of grey stripes . We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . It would look like a banana just sitting on their table . 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[grey]
1851.87	Maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . Could be , it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . Hey we could have a variety of options here . 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2001.85	Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . And what kind of supplements we'll have . 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2218.62	Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . Um 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2246.4	Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2259.61	maybe and and get us a prototype . 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2264.37	Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . So that basically just be working on the prototype , uh we'll accomplish your other two actions . 	ES2016c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
60.52	Yeah well , ja well let's just start . I've uh made a presentation 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[ja]
68.58	uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Smartboard]
110.26	Uh we'll do the opening and then uh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
113.91	we'll meet each other , what uh we already do , so , that's not uh very much trouble . I'll I'll show you the 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
121.44	the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
131.53	We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then uh we'll close the meeting , and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here . So this the opening we'll uh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
167.46	And uh friendly , so size does matter . And uh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
186.84	There happen to be uh three stages . functional , conceptual , and d detailed design . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
194.69	Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
213.2	Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . It just works exactly the same as a computer . You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . So you can uh make uh Words Excel , everything . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Excel]
232.77	Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw . This is a uh well a drawing board . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
251.01	different uh functions on the board . You can see them there . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
271.87	Yes I will eraser so . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
276.37	It's fantas fantastic . We can uh uh well you can save a file . So if uh we draw we have to save everything . Don't throw anything away . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
286.72	Uh just we can start a new one , 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
296.42	We can delete , but we don't do that . Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . It's a bit uh childish you have to write . It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes . Well it's just like a normal uh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
383.75	Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose , loosen up , a bit uh meeting each other well uh uh nice yeah . Sh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
408.45	Yes yes guess . Well I should make it an hippo now . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
503.24	and start a new black uh doc a blank document . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
512.13	and then save it and start an blank document . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
528.52	well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness . So um well you should uh try it but uh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
539.01	Well y y y you could have but uh . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
586.38	Well uh save the document and then uh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
597.16	uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it . No well first yeah . And then you go to format I think , and current colour you choose a new colour . And a new pen width uh also format . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
651.12	And erase things . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
700.32	Yeah save it and start a new blank document . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
771.46	Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first about design uh about uh aim in the market 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
988.89	Oo 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
992.27	N we can use uh it as a as a game pad . So one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1068.56	Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1203.24	Sound nice . Yes . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1232.87	This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1243.73	Oh and uh that's uh that's all . So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . Yeah yes say . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1302.1	But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[D_V_D_s]
1348.05	Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them uh when you buy the 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1355.28	And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1415.09	But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1434.87	uh remote . And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1468.31	In thirty minutes , but uh I think it will be you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here . I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh because uh it's it's the half of the normal size . 	TS3009a.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
364.57	So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_ . 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[L_C_D]
561.11	Well , you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not . 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Marketing, Expert]
622.96	Okay , I'll give the floor . 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
636.34	Go for it . 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
844.02	Yeah yeah . So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it . So this is out of discussion . So if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
908.38	But you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1058.04	Switch on . Yeah . 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1103.88	to comman co communicate , it's just a thing 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[co]
1196.88	Oh , good idea . Very good . Okay , let's move on . 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1445.58	It's kind it's kind of it's more uh it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to to put the controls . Okay let's move on . So time is running , let's move on . 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1779.09	If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana . 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1830.4	Okay . Let's move on . Uh uh yeah . Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype . Go for it . 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[st]
1976.1	A base station . We'll have a base station extra uh on the side . 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2140.76	So . Well . No . Time is running , we have to close the meeting in a few minutes . So , okay , the next step , you can come back to your seat . The next step is to go for to f is to go to uh 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[f]
2215.8	Yeah , maybe , for the n if if if it it works well , we'll go for uh an orange one . Yeah yeah , honour the fruit . 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2226.21	Okay . Thanks very much . We'll see n next meeting . Bye . 	IS1004c.A.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
499.12	Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but mm hmm . 	ES2006a.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Interface, Designer]
53.66	So the goal for today is to decide for a movie to project at the end of the month , so for this month of of April , and also discuss the content for an adver advertising posters and um I I will present you three des different design , we'll discuss it . So first we have to decide for um a movie . 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[today, the, end, of, the, month, this, month, of, of, April]	[]	[]
366.26	Voted for it , and I think only two other mov uh no , f three other movies uh have uh have more votes . 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
516.13	Okay , so uh I think , Mirek , you prepared a presentation also . We can have a look . 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[Mirek]	[]
684.95	And to remember maybe , or 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1074.04	Yeah , I think . Yeah , to sue him afterward . And then 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1201.08	Okay , Andrei , yeah , can can you comment your 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Andrei]
1352.47	To realise how it wa how it was exactly . 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1415.9	To make it like uh an historical movie or 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1581.6	y any of you have uh read the document I prepared on The Big Lebowski . 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y, Big, Lebowski]
1758.0	Yep , yeah , yeah , that's a problem . I'm going to actually I want to show you some posters I prepared for this movie , so we actually can discuss at the same time the poster design . 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1887.23	But then the problem I preferred the first one , because I think it's important to have the plot of movie , e especially for uh a movie people don't n never heard about it . But uh I don't know . 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1915.42	Okay , I'll try to do something , but first anyway we have to select a movie . So I'll put all the information and you want me to put the at the bottom , all the information about the committee and the the Montreux Club , okay . 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Montreux, Club]
2036.56	maybe each of us can s can select two movies or 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2108.02	Um no , actually I'm happy with the choices , because I really I would really push uh American Beauty , because I think it's uh it's an easy movie to watch and and still there are a lot of things to think afterward . 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[American, Beauty]
2142.21	Okay , start , Andrei . No 	IB4011.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Andrei]
281.68	Okay uh welcome you all . Components design , um uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh elaborate some of the things I did . I I elaborated on the concept . What should be um 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
310.24	Uh well first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed . Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[w]
420.76	Let's make it uh black . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
603.8	Okay okay . Well that's possible of course . We could make a little R_ and R_ on the top of the machine . Uh so they are pretty boring , I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
628.4	in which people will find they're uh interesting . And uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
905.71	Go Danny , go Danny . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Danny, Danny]
1160.8	Will recognise that's as a remote control . Uh when I saw your d Oh . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1185.11	Let's put it all together . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1345.64	Because when you put your f Yeah but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll you'll always get some You Yeah . Going to be very greasy and stuff . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1381.92	Zoom opt Ah yeah of course , yeah . You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1417.27	Yeah You can do whatever uh any uh cloth . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1612.76	to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1640.96	Yeah . Yeah sure , look . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1850.89	Take your time . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1881.8	We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1974.62	Let's cut to the chase . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2109.37	Okay . Well put it there . I don't mind . That doesn't doesn't really matter . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2156.39	Use the scroll . Yeah I think so too . So why not , on on side . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2177.49	You have a lot of options , because when you use Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down , you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2233.38	I I You got you got different colours , but you should have a standard colour . 	TS3005c.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1097.91	I'll give it another go . 	ES2014b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1116.08	Right , we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ 	ES2014b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1233.33	My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech A design which looks high-tech , basically . Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said . Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control . That's worth thinking about . Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because um sort of young people are 	ES2014b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Louisa]
1287.25	And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels . 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . Okay um , and that's the end of the slide show . That's it . Cool . 	ES2014b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[recogniti]
1361.22	Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but 	ES2014b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1813.69	I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together . 	ES2014b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1848.69	Uh we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that 	ES2014b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
138.63	Okay , so this is our look and feel presentation , the final our final presentation . And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
152.77	It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that . Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
204.26	how do you say , it's yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat . Yeah , yeah . And working on the inside we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[y]
235.49	Yeah . Yeah . Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
259.11	it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
359.3	uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect . And now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[vo]
638.7	Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah , two or three . No , three . Three . 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
686.39	I'd give it a one . 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
803.4	No , no , the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue , but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised . 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
838.01	Yeah , I'll give it a one as well . 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
905.59	Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , 'cause 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
977.66	I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , but 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1198.5	Yeah , I'd say I'd say it was w yeah , I think I think it's 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1397.52	No , we'll have 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1405.18	C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . It could be in Dollars . And then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve . No . 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros]
1436.48	Yeah , the standard , it um it would make one difference . The biggest one would be taking away if you took away 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1463.47	Yeah i yeah . No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker . If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1530.05	Yeah , we could say 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1549.97	And then say we recommend 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1636.26	No . 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1695.04	Yeah , I'd say , as a team . 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1701.17	Find out from each other , yeah . 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1821.29	Discuss which ones yeah . 	ES2004d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1219.91	Maybe make it in the form of a gun . We can sell it in United States . 	IS1002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[United, States]	[]
1324.62	We're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is . So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left . Um so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily . So I say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , uh something that in a sense will sell itself . Uh innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design . Uh cutting edge technology , I don't think we're gonna have that , these were ideas I was putting together , 	IS1002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1357.18	um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned . I I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way , so maybe we can have some I I talked about environmentally sensitive , uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . I don't know . These are just thoughts . 	IS1002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[New, Age]
1506.65	But boy , we can sell this thing , because there's no batteries , it's environmentally sensitive , i we can identify it as a safer product in some form . 	IS1002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1558.21	Well , see I I see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . You know , let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros , sixty Euros . Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this . Just make this thing uh , yeah , the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls . 	IS1002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euros, Euros, Rolls, Royce]
1843.08	W okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area . So we can say low-cost uh uh um uh good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da . But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market . 	IS1002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1867.46	Yeah for for multi for a multi-function remote , that's a mid-market price . In a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen , nineteen Euro , and that's for the multi-functions , uh D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , uh catch-alls . And and they have 'em in a little box in the middle , and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls . So to me , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness . 	IS1002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Euro, V_C_R]
2055.14	Have a modern , have a traditional , have a you know , and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from . I don't know what that creates cost , or 	IS1002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2250.88	And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy . 	IS1002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2289.4	uh we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot . 	IS1002b.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
270.81	Uh m m i uh i yeah but the p sort of start and end times will give you back to that output . A as a and then you just measure it against , you know , the c the c yeah , the cumulative total time record or something . So 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
364.25	Th th th yeah , the it should still come out that the little sketch I asked this p for for last week about N_X_T_ and whether it would have that sort of tiered effect so you could see the overlap of where one person is looking compared to the other and their mouse movements and things . That that should ra uh address all that . Mm-hmm . But but because it's also in the i based on the the time course of the procedure you'll be able to basically get the scan path of the pattern of events from that as well . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[last, week]	[]	[N_X_T, i]
397.17	Yeah , yeah . So I did have it somewhere . I didn't have it r uh haven't brought it . trying to remember it . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
607.96	So we yeah . So we if we have an an event , yeah , that that yeah , the second line then for the second before it . And then we can just take that chunk out and do something with it . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1262.29	You can we can announce now . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1374.31	Bi um yeah , with some some measure of the so we could work out the number of fixations that made and the average fixation duration as well . Because having st long steady fixations can be informative . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1444.86	Put the actual location 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1491.26	Uh it it yes , it can do , but it's also looking at it within their their own behaviour to see , yeah . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1504.18	Uh th w I I would say just the number of fixations . I mean it could just be yeah , the number of different yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yep . Exactly . So 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1601.93	Uh well , if you've got the number of fixations in the average time , you can then just generate it . Yeah , yeah . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1659.64	Uh that it can vary a bit depending on the calibration . But if we're building in a sort of error margin um it it will be based on pixels around . But there'll also be a minimum one . 'Cause I'm trying to think that it's probably the small the actual mouse icon is so small , it'll need a slightly larger uh just because if what you have i is a sort of larger error or of b error margin around it . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2420.21	No . You can build sub sub-assemblies and then link the the part really , yeah . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2533.22	Construct . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2658.44	Yes . They ca they can appear without them . You c 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2749.51	Uh yes . It at the moment there are d uh there are two I think two small ones and two large triangles . They're actually the same physical size and shape . At the moment they're in different colours . That also means in the p new parts list they're there for , you know , two v large triangles and two small one small ones , say . Whereas in in the revised edition if they were all just black there'd only be one uh mold in the new parts . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[p]
2857.48	No , so they they can have different uh nuts there . W well nuts that are different colours . But same part in different colours , yeah . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3333.68	No , they could just make a mistake or screw up , yeah . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
3422.24	Or oh we're well we yeah . we should should go back to the beginning . The um Camtasia was tested last week and initially we were a bit worried because uh in the old version it seemed to interfere with it . But uh when you when Craig re-compiled it and did his new version it started wor wor it seems to work fine . Um 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[last, week]	[Camtasia]	[Craig, wor]
3470.98	Yes . There will now have to be two Camtasia records because uh e each person actually sees a different screen because of the gaze feedback . They don't see their own gaze to the other person . So there'll need to be two separate Camtasia videos generated . 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[Camtasia, Camtasia]	[]
3531.97	Hmm . I I'll have a uh yeah , I'll have a l a look at the actual Camtasia licence . Um the other thing we're we 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[Camtasia]	[]
3691.61	Uh yeah . See how how long it took them actually . That's that's true . How long did it take them to calibrate . Or yeah . How many t how many times before uh the validation worked or something . Yeah , that's true . I uh 	EN2009d.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
368.18	Yeah . Think so . That's what I pointed out earlier . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
625.1	Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
632.08	That would cut the cost . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
961.46	That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1049.8	Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , and teletext disappears . But the subtitles stay there . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[eight, eight, eight]	[]	[]
1069.64	Well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1380.97	I'd rather just go to the board and 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1384.9	get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1389.28	Or do some market research and see what the options are . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1463.22	to get this to sell . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1664.23	Let's see . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1735.79	I'd go for four , too . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1986.76	Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2040.02	get something of your own . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2378.12	it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . So maybe we should just re-focus . 	TS3003d.D.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
511.53	and sometimes they have a hump . It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking . So when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be . When they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there . That's the way they walk . 	IS1004a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
253.36	You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ . 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
259.51	Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[_]
352.89	Yeah , you'll understand why when we get to my presenta . 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
624.88	No it's got its little camera in there , plug it in . 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
939.42	I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff . Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel , but you've got a lot less control over it . 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[A, _, Z, T, _]
1183.49	And i it would be like I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1332.0	If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , you could just bounce it up and down . 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[kinetic, energy]
1433.61	Uh combine style with a level of functionality , um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function . 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1641.57	G yeah , I would think buttons , yeah . 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1645.68	It's it's the I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , but , you know , I mean most of the time I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ , I think is the the the issue there . 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
1709.19	I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel , so you have to decide whether you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work . 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[s, y]
1980.22	Sorry , do you want me to 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2076.98	Imagine it would be inside . So um actually that could like really cut down your thing , so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into . Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the 	ES2006c.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
408.76	Oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and it'd beep . 	ES2016a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
677.74	I'd I could draw sorta the ball idea . 	ES2016a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
699.56	this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle 	ES2016a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
710.66	Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . If that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you'd have 	ES2016a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
922.18	I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like uh I suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . 	ES2016a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1170.12	But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . 	ES2016a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[th, s]
1297.74	Put it 	ES2016a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1351.09	Does it say what does it say for n it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think . 	ES2016a.C.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
11.56	Put on your mic . 	IS1002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
91.3	Pedro can have it . 	IS1002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Pedro]
96.39	I like I'll help talk . 	IS1002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
204.8	The programme button , yeah the programme button . So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . So um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . So you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um 	IS1002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
249.38	Yeah and it depends on if it's sliding , but I think it's pretty ergonomic . You can feel it . 	IS1002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
294.23	Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . 	IS1002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Mm, Pedro]
368.12	So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , but 	IS1002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
388.84	So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . 	IS1002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
843.7	Yeah um I do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , so there may have been a m miscalculation in there . 	IS1002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
885.83	See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . So yeah it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it . 	IS1002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
900.55	Ah . What do you know . 	IS1002d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
117.11	Yeah , yeah , we might get a 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
214.76	Yes , we'll have the slide-away . 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
411.8	Have a push button interface . 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
450.31	And then we'd have 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
610.77	Just give us a bit of 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
664.0	So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition without 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
698.97	We should Yeah , that would save us one , though we'd still be slightly ov 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1424.58	So should we get So are definite Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has . Okay , so we need to 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1454.69	Yeah , yeah we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going . 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1502.72	So that's eleven point seven , and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements . 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1522.32	And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1658.97	So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1818.07	to use . 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2004.84	Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and um , fit the kind of idea of what they want . And then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start . 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2353.76	We should just go through this quickly and then 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2545.66	one of those things . Like uh , companies can have like a range of products and 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2638.86	Well , sh we look at the last slide , see if it's got anything else . I think there's one one more to go . 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2682.35	Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way . 	ES2014d.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
997.6	Yes , I can go ahead . Last presentation . Okay . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1083.74	And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen , but s I don't know in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything , but uh we might uh consider that . Um well , of course I I hope this is all clear to you . If you you can use remote like this with all the functions , 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1143.41	Um well this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but um it's no longer uh applying . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1190.05	Yeah , this so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other . Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought , or do we want to use um many buttons . So um weighing those factors . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1325.31	well yeah , the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today , um you should keep it s at this . Use big clear buttons . Not too many . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[today]	[]	[]
1336.07	So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options , but I think i this is more important . Um 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1344.9	especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1385.24	And um , well , my conclusion is uh is uh less is more , keep it simple . So uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the the television , some you you'll never know uh and never use , and therefore it's uh important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1490.48	Maybe that's an option . Um keep the primary buttons visible . Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form . But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1520.3	like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible . Um 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1541.6	The extra functions , you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , and then all all the options will become available and you just c s yeah t scroll through them . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1574.05	Well um then I'd like to make a proposal . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1584.21	use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1620.08	Okay , I agree , but I think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1632.27	And so um an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1709.3	Well , I think that he means that um maybe by some option uh make sure that um remote control and the T_V_ match , and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh change the settings of the T_V_ , like colour and then volume and uh 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, _, T_V]
1755.31	Well b but make it a separate option in the menu , so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh displayed here , so uh parents uh 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1816.26	Yeah , you can de display it on the on the old style . You can display actual buttons on the touch screens . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
1970.65	Well you can use um when you uh how do you call it , s um synchronized , the um remote and the T_V_ , then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is , from ah , it's a Philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V, Philips]
2046.88	Mm-hmm . Oh um mo no , you can just say uh the c 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2171.72	Well , at uh you can go back to the shop and uh they 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2176.5	Yeah , ser o and they can download it for you . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2187.73	Yeah . Well already digital information is sent t to the the standards , T_V_ uh connections , you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels , so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard T_V_ uh 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[T_V]
2242.21	Okay , let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2301.58	Break it , I don't get 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2406.55	'Kay , save it as an image on the res 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[Kay]
2420.0	No , and use an image if possible . 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2471.98	The questionnaire , fill in uh we fill out d after lunch or uh 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[]
2488.87	We can leave the P_C_ on I think , yeah and return to the 	TS3007b.B.words.xml	True	[]	[]	[P_C]
